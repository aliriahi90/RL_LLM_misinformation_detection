A study from the business advisory firm, Brunswick found that 47% of employees believe their workplace will not return to normal operations.

Employees can expect to see fewer colleagues in-office and changes to the physical workplace. For example, some companies plan to ditch the reception desk for mudrooms, a space for hanging up your coat, washing your hands, and changing your shoes.

Here are four ways the office could change once you return to work.

Employees believe the coronavirus pandemic will change their work-life forever.

A recent study of more than 1,000 US workers from the business advisory firm Brunswick found at least 47% of remote workers believe their workplaces will not operate the same way in a post-pandemic world. The report shows that 87% of those not going into work are concerned about another wave of office closures in the future.

""We have found ourselves in a world without work not because the robots have taken our jobs, but because the virus has decimated the demand for so many of these jobs,"" said Daniel Susskind, economist and author of ""A World Without Work: Technology, Automation and How We Should Respond,"" in a recent Goldman Sachs webinar.

The coronavirus has fundamentally changed how Americans work and experts are now reimagining workplaces with a host of new safety measures.

For example, before a vaccine for coronavirus is available, it's likely that employees will see fewer workers in the office, which will help prevent the spread of the virus. Employees can also expect changes to the office floor plan. This includes the addition of an ""officle,"" a door-less space that's a mix between an office and a cubicle, Business Insider previously reported.

With some states in the US already reopening and others scheduled to ease restrictions on stay-at-home orders in the coming weeks, it's important to prepare yourself for how the workplace will change.

Here are four ways you will see the office change once you return to work, based on advice from CEOs and architects.

There will be fewer people in the office

It's likely that most employers won't have everyone return to the office at once. A dense space or large social gatherings can increase the transmission of the disease among coworkers.

Because of this, it's likely that there will be few employees working in the office. Some employees may work from home indefinitely. Managers may also consider staggering work schedules throughout the day, or even alternating days or weeks in the office.

Without a vaccine, you can expect a gradual reentry to the workplace. For example, over the next 12-18 months, there may be a cycle of lockdown and relaxation, with periods of 100% remote work, Business Insider previously reported.

You will have to wear a mask at work

Most states are ordering people to wear a mask in public. It's likely that these measures will include the workplace as well. Some workplaces will use one-way hallways to prevent close contact. Landlords or companies may also screen for fevers and other symptoms at the entrance to an office.

While undergoing these changes, Primo Orpilla, a cofounder and principal of Studio O+A, said workplaces must also prioritize making people feel comfortable.

""How do we tell our people that we're making them safe,"" Orpilla told Business Insider. ""But not make it feel like you're going through immigration at San Francisco International Airport?""

No more checking in at the reception desk

Instead of using a receptionist desk for checking in, it's likely that employees will use a mudroom, or more of a home foyer where you take off your coat and wash your hands.

Also, some companies may forgo self-serving coffee machines, according to the architecture solutions firm Gensler. If the budget allows for this, you may see baristas serving up your favorite coffees in house, according to a sample floor plan from Gensler. Hiring a barista can potentially limit the spread of germs among colleagues, Business Insider reported.

You might be quizzed on new office protocols

When employees go back to work, you will also likely see an increase in communication from managers about the changes coming to a post-pandemic workplace. With these changes on the horizon, you will want to stay in the loop.

For example, the CEO of financial services company Discover, Roger Hochschild, has been sending employees daily emails to update them on the changes the company is making.

When it comes to following social distancing protocols, HR may quiz you on how well you can adhere to the rules. Some companies are even creating courses on new protocols, which employees will need to pass before operations resume.",real

Chinese health authorities held a briefing Wednesday on a new coronavirus thought to have originated in Wuhan, China. More than 200 cases have been detected globally, including one case in the U.S.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

China is scrambling to contain a never before seen strain of coronavirus. At least nine people have died; at least 440 are infected, and that includes 15 medical staffers. It has already made its way to six countries now, including the United States after an American was diagnosed upon his return from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have originated. We're joined by NPR's Beijing correspondent Emily Feng. Hi, Emily.

EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hi, David.

GREENE: So how worried is the Chinese government about this right now?

FENG: They're pretty worried, but they're also being really careful. They don't want to cause a panic, but they're also trying to educate the public in how to protect themselves. Some top Chinese health official held a press conference today that NPR went to. Here's Li Bin, China's vice director of its national health commission.

(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)

LI BIN: (Through interpreter) We have ensured management of export channels such as temperature checks at airports, train and bus stations and ports. And we will reduce as much as possible events with large congregations.

FENG: But the problem is that neither - none of these people still know exactly what caused the virus. They think it came from this open-air market where wild animals were sold and eaten. But they don't know what type of animal's behind the virus, so that makes it really hard to prevent future outbreaks.

GREENE: And now, I mean, this has arrived in the United States. It's arrived in other countries, which is beginning to raise more alarms around the world. I mean, can you just remind me of the timeline of all this? It seems to have almost come out of nowhere.

FENG: It's really exploded over the last couple of days, and there are several theories as to why. But the first case was reported about 3 1/2 weeks ago on New Year's Eve. And then the cases climbed, but they plateaued for about three weeks and stayed - and never broke, about 60 confirmed cases. It's really only been in the last three days that we've this sudden jump in the number of cases in China, and you've also seen this jump in measures that authorities have taken to screen for the virus and to prevent it from spreading.

So as Li Bin mentioned, there are now temperature sensors set up at train stations and on airplanes. They're even doing temperature checks at some hotels. But people are understandably very, very worried.

GREENE: Do they feel like their government is doing enough in China?

FENG: There's a lot of debate online about this. There's skepticism that they're even being told how severe the problem is. As of today, there are more than 450 confirmed cases, but that's a huge jump just in the last four days from the low numbers that were reported over the last few weeks. A London study from Imperial College there has gone viral in China, and that estimates that there should be at least 1,700 cases based on similar types of viruses that have broken out before.

China refutes that study. Here's the director of China's disease control center, Gao Fu, today responding to the study.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GAO FU: (Through interpreter) This is a mathematical model. The number you are referring to was the maximum in the range predicted. Faced with viruses like this, facts must be facts, and theories are just theories.

FENG: So they've been really, really strict in controlling information about the virus. They've actually even detained some people who they said were spreading rumors on social media, when these people claimed that they had relatives who've gotten sick or even died and were not reported in the official statistics.

But they have a reason for being suspicious. China's government does have a history of deliberately underreporting outbreaks. The most recent example is just last year. There was something called African swine flu. Provincial authorities denied that the case was really severe, and that let the flu spread to other pig farms and wiped out something like 40% of the pigs in China. And then most infamously, in 2003, SARS, which ended up killing more than 800 people, but the Chinese government denied.

GREENE: NPR's Emily Feng reporting on this virus outbreak in China. She joins us this morning. Thanks so much. We appreciate it, Emily.

FENG: Thanks, David.

[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly refer to African swine flu. In fact, the disease is a virus known as African swine fever.]

When Carolynn van Arsdale, a senior at the University of Vermont, was forced to leave her campus amid coronavirus concerns last month, it caused a lot of complications. "" I was forced to move out of my apartment building and move into my mother's house in a different state,"" she said. ""I lost one of my jobs ... and I've been struggling with my mental health. All of these stresses have challenged me in being able to do my best in my college courses.""

Samantha Noor, a student at the University of Southern California, had to leave behind the research she had been conducting all year for her senior thesis. While she tried to write up her results remotely, it proved difficult as she had unreliable Internet connection and could no longer access her lab. ""It's been really stressful,"" Noor said. ""I think I might have to drop the thesis personally because it's my last semester and I don't want to end up with a C or a fail that I could have avoided.""

Noor and van Arsdale are among the millions of college students across the country who have been forced to switch to online classes via platforms such as Blackboard and Zoom as the coronavirus has shut down campuses. For many students, health is not the only concern that the growing pandemic brings — they also have to worry about finding new housing or access to food, a lagging or even non-existent Internet connection, plus leaving behind their friends and personal belongings.

All that on top of their course load.

Yet many universities have been hesitant to make changes to their grading system for the semester despite how drastically students' lives have changed in light of the pandemic. Some schools put the power in their students' hands: Colby College in Maine, the University of California Davis and the University of Vermont, where van Arsdale attends, have given students the option between taking a course for a grade or taking a class pass-fail.

""Our goal was to give students as much flexibility and choice as possible and allow our students to focus on learning and doing their best work knowing that they have control over how they are evaluated,"" explained Margaret McFadden, who oversaw the changes to Colby College's grading system for the semester.

Other schools have made all courses pass-fail, including a handful of Ivy League schools like Yale University and Columbia University.

""I live in a cramped apartment with my family where most of my work must be completed on my mattress or on the floor,"" said Miskiyat Jimba, a senior at Amherst College. ""My ability to complete coursework at home is drastically different than what I was capable of at school. "" Amherst College has extended their pass-fail deadline amid coronavirus, but Jimba and her friends said they reached out to the Provost and Dean of Faculty to advocate for more drastic changes.

Jimba is not the only student to try to reason with her school's administration. Students across the country have argued — and organized around the idea — that universities should grant them leniency when it comes to grades for this semester as the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic has made it difficult to focus on or prioritize their studies. ""I spent my entire spring break trying to advocate for students most vulnerable to economic, mental and physical harm during this pandemic,"" said Charlie Jones, a junior at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie who is a co creator of the ""Nobody Fails VC"" campaign arguing for a Universal Pass at the school.

Students at Simmons University in Boston, Cornell University and several other colleges have created petitions and contacted their administration to argue why it is unethical to allow a student to fail or stress about their GPA during a global pandemic, and students at Yale University successfully convinced the administration to switch to a pass-fail grading system for the spring 2020 semester.

Other schools have held back on changing grading policies because they're worried about accreditation issues if they remove grades for the semester. That's despite the fact that some colleges, such as Brown University, have been entirely grade-optional for decades.

""Schools do not jeopardize their accreditation status if they changed their grading system in light of COVID-19,"" confirmed Sonny Ramaswamy, who leads the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, a regional accreditation agency. ""We have had a number of our institutions switch from a letter grade to a pass-fail option, which we have approved, in line with the guidance from the US Department of Education. We only require that if the institution switches to a pass-fail system or give all students an A grade only, they must apply it fairly and equitably to all students.""

While the majority of students seem to be vouching for a universal pass-fail policy, there is also a significant number of students who would prefer to be graded as usual. Some students who are interested in graduate school, for example, might be hoping to boost their GPA this semester, especially as programs like Harvard Medical School have announced that although they will accept pass-fail grading for spring 2020 coursework, they would prefer letter grades if students were given that option at their particular school.

No matter what grading policy a college adopts, said Diego Gomez, a student at Amherst College, it is imperative that schools are understanding towards student's needs and get their input before moving forward. ""Any time I think about it, I cannot believe my schoolwork is being assessed and graded during a pandemic,"" he said. ""Having the chance to get good grades, in my view, should not be one of the reasons I am working to keep myself and my family healthy right now.""",real

""Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), warned the US would have to increase its disease-tracking capabilities rapidly in the next few months to avoid another public health crisis as seasonal flu coincides with the second wave of COVID-19."" How does this warning portend for the future?

""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed in a private call with House Republicans Wednesday that the $600 per month enhanced unemployment benefits that are keeping millions of people afloat amid Great Depression-level joblessness will not be extended in the next coronavirus stimulus legislation,"" Common Dreams reported Thursday. Is this leverage? Is he playing a game of chicken with Americans’ bank accounts?

""As US-China rhetoric grows harsher, new risks emerge with Taiwan drawn into the mix,"" read a Thursday headline from the Washington Post.

18,558,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/nyregion/rent-strike-coronavirus.html,2020-05-01,#CancelRent Is New Rallying Cry for Tenants. Landlords Are Alarmed.,"
As unemployment soars across the country, tenants rights groups and community nonprofits have rallied around an audacious goal: to persuade the government to halt rent and mortgage payments — without back payments accruing — for as long as the economy is battered by the coronavirus.
The effort has been brewing on social media, with the hashtag #CancelRent and online video rallies, as well as a smattering of in-person protests, frequently held in cars to maintain social distancing.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, offered a fervent endorsement of the campaign, encouraging her progressive base to embrace a movement to upend the housing market.
“It’s not that it’s impossible to do and it’s not that we can’t do it,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a live video on her Facebook page on Monday. “We lack enough politicians with political will to actually help people who are tenants and actually help people who are mom-and-pop landlords.”
But in New York and other cities, landlords say they too are struggling to pay their bills since many tenants have already been unable to pay rent. They call the advocates’ efforts reckless and say that withholding rent would create cascading consequences, including leaving property owners without the means to pay mortgages and property taxes or to maintain buildings.
Still, from New York to Kansas City to Los Angeles, groups are encouraging tenants to withhold payments on Friday, the due date for May rent, aiming to create pressure for an expansion of affordable housing and tenant-friendly legislation.
To cancel rent and mortgage payments, the federal government would have to take sweeping and possibly unconstitutional intervention in the housing and financial markets, interceding in private contracts and ordering banks and landlords not to collect money.
While the prospect of this happening is low,  the campaigns are less about pushing a particular piece of legislation and more about kindling a mass movement akin to the Occupy Wall Street protests that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
“Rent is not being paid, and the organizing strategy is figuring out how we rally around that and politicize it for our benefit,” said Tara Raghuveer, director of the Homes Guarantee campaign of People’s Action, a national network of local advocacy organizations.
Groups from California to New York have amassed a sizable following of renters who say they will skip May rent. They have also received a boost from progressive members of Congress,  who introduced a cancel rent bill.
“It’s a moment that people are literally rising up for real transformation in the housing market,” said Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator at Housing Justice for All, a New York group.
Though nascent, the movement has alarmed landlords, especially smaller property owners who say that they, like many of their tenants, also survive month to month.
“When government officials say, ‘Cancel rent,’” said Jay Martin, the executive director of Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents 4,000 New York City landlords, “they are essentially saying that we are canceling the ability for you to pay the bills we are putting on you.”
Mr. Martin said that if tenants’ rights organizers wanted to target a main driver of high housing costs, they should encourage elected officials to cut property taxes. A recent report by the New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board said that about 30 percent of a landlord’s expenses for rent-regulated apartments go toward property taxes.
New York, which has more housing units than any place in the United States, is a city of renters: There are nearly 2.2 million rental units in the city. Mr. Martin said that no landlord he knows would want to evict a tenant in this economy.
“Landlords are being made the scapegoat for all the problems,” he said.Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords in New York City, warned that a rent strike would “create an economic and housing pandemic.”
“The city and its residential housing landscape will crumble into an economic abyss worse than the 1970s, when New York was the national poster child for urban blight,” Mr. Strasburg said.
As bad as the economy is, rental payments in April were better than many landlords expected.As businesses laid off employees, property owners reported a steep drop in rent collections, with close to a third of tenants behind as of the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners.
But by month’s end, after stimulus payments and unemployment checks started flowing, the nationwide nonpayment rate was only three percentage points below where it was a year ago.
Still, those numbers probably understate the stress, as various surveys show that landlords have deferred rent, offered concessions or used security deposits to cover missed payments. And tenants have increasingly used credit cards to cover their bills.
Vincia Barber, 39, who lost her nanny job for a family in New York City that decided to move to California during the pandemic, said that she has decided to join the rent strike.
She pays $1,877 for a rent-stabilized apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that she shares with her 14-year-old daughter. There is mold growing on the bathroom walls, and they cannot open windows because of the stench of garbage behind the building, she said.
“Something needs to change,” Ms. Barber said. “If it’s not now during the Covid-19 epidemic, then I don’t know what it’s going to take for the governor and mayor to do something.”
Rent strike or not, tens of millions of people will be under severe rent stress in May. Looking to rally people digitally, on Thursday, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, which acts as a campaign hub for advocacy organizations, unveiled WeStrikeTogether.org, a website that will accumulate the various May rent strikes into a nationwide heat map.
People who sign up will be directed to a list of resources and be routed to local housing organizations to try and build more support for the #CancelRent campaign.
“The traditional definition of a rent strike is someone who is choosing not to pay for whatever reason, and we’re defining it more broadly here to help people see that it’s a political choice not to help folks who can’t pay rent,” said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of the action center.
It’s not as if tenants have lacked support: The $2 trillion CARES Act distributed expanded unemployment insurance and the stimulus payments, along with aid to public-housing providers and grants that states can use for rental assistance.
Still, tenant organizers and landlords are pushing for direct housing assistance.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, which would relieve tenants of their obligation to pay rent, transfer mortgages to the federal government and allow landlords to recoup their rent costs — but only if they agree to a vast new regulatory program that includes a rent freeze and the inability to collect back payments.",real
21,1968,https://gellerreport.com/2020/05/trump-cdc-who-birx.html/,2020-05-23,"Trump, Birx Vs. CDC, W.H.O.","The White House and the CDC have been largely at odds amid the coronavirus pandemic. It appears that Dr. Deborah Birx has taken Trump’s side, chastising the US agency for what she claims are inflated COVID death numbers. US observers explain the conflict between Trump and the medical experts and shed light on Birx’s “political game”.

As calls for reopening the US economy become louder inside the Trump camp, tensions between the White House and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have soared. CDC director Robert R. Redfield and counterpart Anthony Fauci, the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have repeatedly warned the president’s Coronavirus Task Force against reopening the country too soon. According to some reports, it is Dr. Deborah Birx, however, who has Trump’s ear.

Birx: Mediator or New Political Player in WH?

Birx was recently dubbed by Axios “the real power doctor” on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, emphasising the physicians’ “masterful political skills”. According to Axios, “Birx strategically emphasises the points Trump wants to hear”. She, in particular, is highly critical of the World Heath Organization (WHO) and insists that the global entity is badly in need of reform. Birx has claimed that WHO’s tracking system is inflating mortality rates and case numbers by up to 25 percent. She has also asserted that “there is nothing from the CDC that [she] can trust”, according to The Washington Post. On Thursday, Birx touted recent reports claiming sharp declines in both deaths and hospitalisations across the country, claims that could accelerate the reopening of the US economy.

“Dr. Birx role has been highly questionable in the early stages, but she appears to have become more responsible of late”, observes James Fetzer, professor emeritus at University of Minnesota.

He emphasises the doctor’s criticism of CDC tabulation of COVID-related deaths which she claims distort and inflate COVID-19 statistics. According to Fetzer, Birx has declared that “The White House has been completely justified in discounting the ‘experts’ from NIH, the WHO and the CDC”.

Birx previously decried what she described as media exaggeration and fear-mongering over the deadly virus, noted Pamela Geller, an American political activist, blogger and editor-in-chief of the Geller Report, in the the top health official’s critiques of the CDC.

“The level of misinformation and disinformation is deeply troubling”, she suggests. “The continuing shutdown of our country is the biggest mistake in American history, and the White House is correct in repeatedly calling for reopening”.

Birx is Trying to Balance Between Science & Calls to Reopen

American journalist and author Daniel Lazare is not impressed by Birx’s performance: “Deborah Birx may think she’s the ‘Trump whisperer’ who can keep him under control”, he says. “But she’s only able to do so is by telling him what he wants to hear”.

The journalist is skeptical about Birx’s attempts to “defend” Trump in the press. According to Lazare, she sometimes distorts reality in an apparent attempt to appease the president. “On 28 March, she declared in a press conference that ‘almost 40 percent of the country’ has ‘extraordinarily low numbers’ of COVID cases, neglecting to mention that those are rural areas containing only 7.2 percent of the US population”, he notes.

Birx is not much of a political player, she is just “trying to balance between the Trump administration’s desire to rapidly reopen and basic scientific facts” opines Caleb Maupin, speaker, writer, journalist, and political analyst.

“She is trying to play a centrist position, as is Fauci”, he says. “Birx and Fauci trying to navigate in the middle of this, and they’re facing kind of an onslaught from Trump’s supporters in the Trump administration”.

Science is Held Hostage to Political & Economic Interests

The CDC has seemingly taken a backseat in the White House task force and is playing a much quieter role than at initial stages of the pandemic, as media remark on Fauci’s absence from interviews this week – as the country reopens – as similarly noteworthy. The CDC release of detailed guidance for reopening schools, mass transit and nonessential businesses was made without a formal announcement, and came only after a number of states started lifting lockdowns, according to CNBC.

According to Maupin, the CDC, as well as other health agencies, have fallen victim to mounting pressure in some parts of the US.

“It would be seen as undermining the medical community at a time when they need support”, the journalist says. “It’s an indirect form of pressure, but it shows that science is deeply impacted by society. There’s a whole history of this. Science is not independent”.

The political analyst suggests that “science is always impacted by the society that creates it” and “political interests that fund research would prefer one outcome as opposed to another”. The issue of dropping the lockdown measures has also become a playground for various business interests, with some industries, like Walmart and Amazon, benefitting from the lockdown, while the real sector is desperately pushing to reopen.

“We have one section of the American elite that wants the science to say we can reopen now and the American elite that wants to say science says we have to be closed down as long as we possibly can”, Maupin says, additionally claiming that the so-called elite is “paying scientists to say what they want”.

The dysfunctional dynamics at play between the CDC and White House are clear for all to see, echoes Ethan Ralph, founder of conservative website, The Ralph Retort.

“I think it’s fairly obvious that there’s been tension for awhile now”, he says. “I don’t think Trump really wanted to shut things down in the first place and was basically scared into it. Ever since then, he’s been moving to open up as quickly as possible. Some see this as reckless, even within his own virus response high command”.

‘Political & Health Officials Should Work in Unison’

Though the CDC has its problems, it must be remembered that the agency is dealing with Trump, who is determined to reopen the economy regardless of the cost to public health, and whatever the agencies say or do is going to be wrong, argues Daniel Lazare. According to him, “the tension between the White House and the CDC is just the latest manifestation of the chaos that has reigned since the virus first appeared in the US in late January”.

The controversy between the White House and the country’s health and science community is only exacerbating the problem, according to Professor Kelley Lee, tier 1 Canadian research chair in Global Health Governance.

“The countries that respond most effectively during this pandemic will be countries where public health officials and political leaders work in close unison, and where public health experts are allowed to define policy action”, Lee said.

What’s going on in the US is the opposite, Lee remarked. According to him, the Trump administration “has frequently ignored the advice of scientific experts and prioritised political and economic interests instead”.

While CDC has been subject to harsh criticism by the Trump administration and its conservative supporters, the truth of the matter is that SARS-CoV-2 is an absolutely new virus no one has ever dealt with, underscores Mitchell Feierstein, a hedge-fund manager and CEO of the Glacier Environmental Fund Limited.",fake
23,2025,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/05/after-predicting-2016-michael-moore-fears-trump-will-mess-with-2020,,"“There Will Be No Election If Things Keep Going the Way They’re Going”: After Predicting 2016, Michael Moore Fears Trump Will Mess With 2020","Michael Moore, for decades on the political front lines, is hunkered down inside, riding out the pandemic from his Upper West Side apartment. “I literally have not stepped outside the door of my apartment building in 71 days,” he told me this week. He’s had one visitor in that time—a handyman—and sees his doorman from a distance when retrieving a package. Kind neighbors have dropped goodies outside his door. “I think they’re worried about me,” he says dryly. He fortunately has a balcony, a coveted feature for many sun-starved New Yorkers, and it’s there where he gets his daily exercise, walking back and forth in the small outdoor space until he’s logged a mile or two.

“The people across the street,” he said with a laugh, “it must look like there’s a lunatic who lives across the street from them.” Last month, on his 45th day in isolation, Moore turned 66, and his age and past bout with pneumonia make him a prime candidate to get hit hard by the virus. After spending much of the fall and winter stumping through Iowa and New Hampshire on behalf of Bernie Sanders, Moore opted not to travel ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries being held in early March, wary of a coronavirus crisis that was only just coming into focus in the United States. Moore recalled getting scared straight after talking to experts and academics and seeing “a runaway train heading in our direction.” To Moore’s friends it seemed like uncharacteristic alarmism. At that point in February, there had yet to be a death from COVID-19 reported in the U.S.; “social distancing” was still weeks away from entering the lexicon. “Everybody was like, ‘Dude, this doesn’t sound like you,’” Moore said. “I said, ‘No, I know, but I’m just using my own instinct here. I’m not a scientist.’”

What Moore had to figure out then was where to quarantine. A doctor recommended Michigan, where the Flint native has a home, cautioning that New York’s hospital system could be overwhelmed. But Moore had visions of the virus bringing about chaos and unrest, even angry mobs, a scene straight out of The Day of the Locust. He concluded that “it would be actually more dangerous to be in the place where people are carrying a lot of guns.” “This was all before we watched all the people I went to high school with show up at the state capitol with their guns,” he said, referring to the anti-lockdown protests in Michigan that have drawn some rifle-toting demonstrators and President Donald Trump egging them on with a call to “liberate” the state.

Moore distinguished himself in 2016 as one of the few prominent media voices to predict Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton. “I have had a different lens that I have looked through when I look at Trump, different from other liberals or lefties or Democrats,” Moore said. “I always have taken him seriously. I believe him when he says something. This is something other liberals don’t do, and this is why we were defeated in 2016.” Trump’s infamous boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters? “I believe him,” Moore said. “I believe that’s a true statement.” And Moore believes that Trump may indeed be taking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19, as he’s claimed. “I think he’s very freaked out that his valet, the guy who’s getting him his Kentucky Fried Chicken, came down with it,” Moore said.",fake

I touched on it while writing about immigrant workers in Swedish nursing homes.

In early April, some medical experts estimated that Somalis represented 40% of the coronavirus deaths in Stockholm and 18% of the death toll in Sweden. That may be because of Stockholm’s first 15 coronavirus deaths, 6 of those who died were Somalis. The Somalis have been followed by Iraqis, Syrians, and Afghans as being significantly overrepresented among the ranks of coronavirus cases. In early April, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health revealed that immigrants made up 1 in 5 cases of the virus and that 1 in 100 Somalis in Norway had tested positive for the virus. A week later, it was 1 in 4. Somalis made up 6% of confirmed cases. And in Helsinki, Finland, Somalis accounted for 17% of cases. The coronavirus is a recent phenomenon and we don’t have all the answers as to why some groups appear to be more vulnerable to it than others. Researchers have proposed varying explanations for Somali vulnerability from ethnic benign neutropenia, to low vitamin D levels, dense living conditions, intergenerational households, high rates of smoking, and poor language skills.

And now some data points from the UK.

Nearly all the doctors who have died of covid-19 in the United Kingdom have been ethnic minorities, most born overseas, like el-Tayar, according to the British Medical Association. That grim toll has confounded health experts, alarmed minority physicians, and startled a nation that relies on immigrants to swell the ranks of its public health-care system

Relying on them might not be a good idea, especially considering the rate of coronavirus infections in hospitals which may be as high as 1 in 5.

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic minority backgrounds, significantly higher than the 13 percent in the population at large. Last year, more than half the new doctors who registered in Britain were born overseas. But experts say it’s still baffling that 93 percent of the doctors who have died of covid-19 were ethnic minorities.

It is baffling. It shows that there's still plenty we don't know about the virus.

People of African and Middle Eastern origin do appear to be more susceptible to the disease. Some of the doctors in question however were from Pakistan and India.

According to a Guardian newspaper analysis, more than 180 health workers have died of covid-19, the majority of them ethnic minorities. Another analysis of 106 National Health Service deaths found that two-thirds were among ethnic minorities.

These numbers are striking. And looking deeper into what they mean would be more helpful if the media didn't, as usual, pivot to false claims of racism.

The NHS numbers do seem to show a high rate of Asian deaths among NHS workers. Unlike the US, this is more likely to mean Pakistani. Health care workers born in the Philippines however seemed to have the highest death rate.",fake
27,645,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-medical-students-who-joined-the-battle-against-the-coronavirus,2020-05-06,The Medical Students Who Joined the Battle Against the Coronavirus,"In medical school, the third Friday of March is a day of judgment. During their fourth and final year, students commit to a busy courting ritual, called the Match, which dictates where, and in what specialty, they’ll spend the next phase of their training, as medical residents. They’ve ranked their favorite programs, and the programs, in turn, have ranked them; an algorithm at the National Resident Matching Program’s headquarters has worked out the pairings. The climax of this ordeal is Match Day, when fourth years assemble at formal celebrations to learn who will go where. At some schools, students open their white envelopes one by one on an auditorium stage, in front of a crowd of their peers. New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine gathers the class in a restaurant near Bellevue Hospital, where faculty advisers fan out batches of letters, like playing cards, for the students to draw in small groups. Those who get left with programs on the low end of their rank lists can slip away to sulk, while their luckier peers pop bottles of champagne. (Students who match nowhere at all learn their fates earlier in the week and scramble to clinch a slot wherever they can find one.)

Early this March, as social-distancing measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus took effect in New York City, members of Grossman’s graduating class began to sense that their Match ceremony might not proceed as usual. Two weeks before Match Day, administrators notified them that the event would be limited to the graduating class, faculty, and staff—no guests allowed. Sam Dubin, a twenty-six-year-old fourth year, called his parents, in Cincinnati, who had planned to fly in for the occasion. At first, it still seemed possible that they could travel to New York anyway; Dubin and his boyfriend, an editor named Jeremy, had planned to have their parents meet on Match Day, at a Shabbat dinner after the ceremony. Then the flights stopped, and the restaurants closed. The Sunday before Match Day, N.Y.U. called off the gathering altogether. On Friday the 20th, in the Greenwich Village apartment that the couple shares, Dubin received his Match results over e-mail, patching in his family on FaceTime to share the news: he’d be remaining at N.Y.U., to complete a residency in primary-care internal medicine. Dubin is tall and talkative, with a crewcut and a silver ring in the cartilage of one ear. Whether out of bashfulness or Match Day etiquette, he was hesitant to admit that the N.Y.U. program had been his top choice. “I’ve always joked that I didn’t want to open that envelope around other people,” he told me, adding, “I guess I got what I asked for.”

Sam Dubin, who is twenty-six, graduated early from N.Y.U. to start working at Bellevue Hospital, where he had completed clinical rotations during school.

By then, the vast majority of medical schools had already cancelled classes and dismissed students from their clinical rotations. Dubin’s final course, a health-policy elective, had migrated online, but the pandemic soon pulled many guest speakers away, into more urgent tasks. “It was like, ‘Oh, the C.M.O. of Bellevue can’t come lecture us, because he’s busy restructuring the hospital,’ ” Dubin said. He and his classmates looked for ways to join the fight against the virus: he signed up for New York City’s Medical Reserve Corps; other students volunteered through N.Y.U., organizing P.P.E. collection. To combat a shortage of health-care workers, hospitals in the city were redeploying specialists from fields like dermatology and orthopedics to work in emergency rooms and intensive-care units. Governor Andrew Cuomo had called on retired physicians and nurses to return to work; buses were delivering health-care workers from out of town. On March 24th, Dubin e-mailed Linda Tewksbury, an associate dean at the Grossman School of Medicine, to ask whether he should schedule volunteer slots with the Medical Reserve Corps or stay tuned for opportunities at N.Y.U. Tewksbury wrote back an hour later: “There will be an email going out about this before the end of the day. . . . ”

That evening, N.Y.U. became the first medical school to mobilize its fourth-year students. “We ask for your help,” the dean wrote, in bold letters, in a message sent to Grossman’s graduating class. If enough students expressed interest, the note explained, the school would move to graduate fourth years early and send them to work as new physicians in the city’s overloaded hospitals. In a normal year, the months after matching serve as a future doctor’s “senior spring,” a respite between the slog of coursework behind and the extreme demands of residency ahead. Dubin had planned to visit the Grand Canyon with his parents, then fly to San Francisco for a wedding that Jeremy had agreed to officiate. One of his peers, who was looking forward to an overseas trip, recalled thinking, when he first saw Tewksbury’s e-mail, I don’t want to fucking do this. But with travel restricted and lockdowns taking effect across the globe, any vacation plans now seemed impossible. Rather than “bake sourdough and play computer games,” Dubin told me, he wanted to contribute. In the first twelve hours after N.Y.U.’s request went out, more than forty of his classmates expressed interest.

Before the pandemic caused N.Y.U. to cancel its Match Day ceremony, Dubin (right) and his boyfriend, Jeremy, had planned to introduce their parents after the event.

In the end, fifty-two fourth years—almost half of the class—decided to graduate early. On April 3rd, they positioned themselves in front of their screens for an ad-hoc commencement ceremony conducted over a video-conferencing site. Dubin logged in, with Jeremy seated beside him, from a small second bedroom that they use as an office. Several graduates wore caps and gowns; one had fashioned a makeshift diploma from a manila envelope. One by one, in a prerecorded montage, their teachers and advisers appeared onscreen to offer words of encouragement; some addressed them from the hospital, wearing P.P.E. Steven Abramson, the chair of the Department of Medicine, welcomed them as “members of what we now call the COVID army.” To conclude, Tewksbury asked the new doctors to unmute their microphones and recite the Hippocratic oath. A few hours later, an emergency push alert lit up the phones of New Yorkers, calling on licensed health-care workers to volunteer. When Dubin saw the message, he thought to himself, I’m on my way.

A bit of conventional wisdom within medicine holds that the most dangerous time to be a patient in the hospital is July, when a new class of interns enters the workforce and the previous year’s class assumes new responsibilities. In America, this is known as the July effect; in the United Kingdom, where new doctors start in August, it’s called the Killing Season. It’s unclear how much of an actual risk the turnover poses to patients—various studies have attempted to compare outcomes, with conflicting results—in part because the hospital hierarchy is designed to limit the responsibilities of new doctors. Under normal circumstances, medical training involves a formal system of apprenticeship, in which interns work under the supervision of junior residents—who, in turn, work under more senior ones—and whole teams of trainees report to attending physicians. Interns “present” patients to their teams, relying on experienced doctors to review their notes and treatment plans.

The pandemic, and the strain that it has put on the health-care system, has reconfigured both the physical layouts of hospitals and the teams that staff them. During Dubin’s first week as a new doctor, in a unit on the sixteenth floor of Bellevue, his team included an older resident in psychiatry, a rheumatology fellow, and a gerontologist who normally works in one of the hospital’s outpatient clinics. Having completed rotations at Bellevue during school, Dubin knew the setting better than some of the doctors and many of the travelling nurses who heeded Cuomo’s call. But, even to him, the I.C.U. appeared unrecognizable: I.V. stands had been stationed outside closed doors, he said, creating the look of a “ghostly arcade,” so that nurses could treat patients without exposing themselves to the virus. One of Dubin’s classmates, Lizbeth Hu, graduated early and now works in an oncology unit at Tisch Hospital. Though her team doesn’t treat COVID-19 patients, Hu said, they still suffer from personnel shortages brought on by the pandemic. “Putting a patient on narcotics, or ordering a blood transfusion, or tailoring antibiotic regimens—these are things that last week I would never have imagined doing on my own, or being able to do correctly,” Hu told me at the end of her third shift. “And I’ve done all of those things this week. Really everybody you’re working with is doing something they’re not used to.”

Lizbeth Hu, a twenty-six-year-old graduate of N.Y.U., is working in an oncology ward on the fourteenth floor of Tisch Hospital.

Adjusting to less oversight is a standard part of the learning curve for new physicians: submitting medication orders no longer requires a co-signature, so there had better not be an extra zero on the dosage; signing off on a patient’s D.N.R. status may suddenly fall to them. The pandemic has made the decisions faced by new doctors more complicated, and more perilous. Janna Minehart, another N.Y.U. graduate, started work in a COVID-19 ward at Tisch, two floors above Hu. A native of San Jose, California, Minehart is calm and forthright, with long red hair that she wears in a loose bun during work. On her first day, she was assigned a middle-aged patient with both COVID-19 and metastatic cancer. Less than an hour into her shift, Minehart received a page from a nurse: the patient had developed a gaze deviation and weakness on one side of her body. “Oh, shit,” Minehart recalled thinking when she reached the room. “She’s having a stroke.” Because of the limits on patient contact, Minehart hadn’t conducted a full neurological exam; because the patient was new, she couldn’t tell how much her current condition deviated from her baseline, either. “Do I do a little bit more history-taking?” Minehart now wondered. “Do I do a little bit more of a physical exam, before I call the stroke code?” There’s a saying that students learn about the treatment of stroke patients: time lost is brain lost. When Minehart’s resident advised her to call the code, she realized that she didn’t yet know how to activate the page system to summon the on-call neurologist.",real

Apple and Google are rolling out their exposure notification API so that public health agencies can start including the technology in their apps.

22 countries have been given access to the API along with three US states, the companies said.

It's the first major phase of the technology. Apple and Google have spent weeks finessing the privacy elements of the app, as well as improving the level of control for public health agencies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Apple and Google have started rolling out their COVID-19 contact tracing tech in a publicly available software update, meaning public health agencies can start building it into apps.

The arrival of the application programming interface (API) – which Apple and Google now officially call the exposure notifications system – means public health agencies can begin to roll out their own contact tracing apps to users.

The software will use Bluetooth to detect other smartphones in close proximity and alert the user – assuming they have a relevant health app installed – if they come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said that 22 countries on five continents have received access to the API, along with three US states: Alabama, South Carolina, and North Dakota. More locations will get access in the coming weeks, Apple and Google said.

Spokespeople for Google and Apple said that in most cases the API will only be available to one app per country, but said exceptions could be made. However, this does not appear to be the case for the US, where individual states are creating their own apps.

Apple and Google consulted with several public health groups to finesse the API, including the CDC Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

Off the back of those talks, the API has been tweaked with several improvements for health agencies, including letting agencies themselves decide what constitutes ""an exposure event"" between people, and determine the level of risk from instances of someone coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.

The companies said they will continue to update and improve the API as they get feedback from public health authorities.

Earlier this month, Apple and Google gave us a preview of what the interface might look like on iPhones and Android smartphones. It also recently announced it had tightened some of the privacy controls around the tech, including encrypting the data that gets shared via Bluetooth.

But the bigger challenge will be for public health agencies to get people to download their apps. One study has suggested that 60% of the population would need to adopt these apps for the technology to be effective, but according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll, nearly three in five Americans said they would be unwilling or unable to use Google and Apple's contact tracing technology.

The UK is currently trialing its own NHS contract tracking app, which has been criticized by cybersecurity researchers who discovered several security risks.

However, it was recently reported that the NHS could be working on a separate app that uses Google and Apple's API.

The Microsoft co-founder and prominent eugenicist has been more outspoken in recent days than perhaps ever before about his desire to vaccinate the entire world, in this case as soon as possible for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And the reality is that many more will die from the vaccine than from the virus itself.

Speaking during a recent segment on CNBC, Gates admitted that in order to make vaccines “work” for the most vulnerable groups, they have to be super-charged, in a sense.

And this super-charging means that some people are going to be injured or killed as a result.

“We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that,” Gates stated about his plans for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination.

“And doing that so that you amp it up so that it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects, if we have one in 10,000 side effects that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.”

Bill Gates also says flu vaccines do not work for older people

During this same interview, Gates admitted something that we, too, have reported on: that influenza vaccines are pretty much useless in older people.

Though supposedly high-risk seniors are pushed to get their flu shots annually, Gates confessed to the fact that this yearly ritual does nothing to protect them against the flu.

“The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge,” Gates stated. “It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people.”

“And that actual decision of, ok, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed.”

In his own analysis, Martin Armstrong of Armstrong Economics crunched the data and found that the number of deaths around the world that are being attributed to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pales in comparison to the number of people who will be injured or killed by Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, based on Gates’ own admission.

While the worldwide death count associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently right around a quarter-million, the roughly one percent of people who could potentially die from a Gates-funded Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is about triple that.

This suggests that society is better off telling Gates to hit the road and letting the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) run its course – with proper nutrition, of course.

Vaccine experiments like the ones Gates is pushing for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) have been tried before, by the way.

Back in the ’70s, the United States rolled out a vaccine for “swine flu” that was administered to some 45 million people over the course of 10 weeks.

This vaccination effort was halted, however, after it was discovered that no cases of swine flu were even detected outside of the military base where it was said to have originated.

Meanwhile, one in 100,000 vaccinated individuals ended up suffering from side effects that included Guillain-Barré syndrome, while another 53 died.

Because of the horrors caused by this vaccination campaign, Guillain-Barré is supposedly monitored every single flu season to ensure that influenza vaccine safety meet certain safety thresholds.

“The side effect of treason is lead poisoning or rope burn, but not usually both,” joked one Big League Politics commenter in reference to Bill Gates.

“John the Baptist paved the way for Jesus,” wrote another. “Bill Gates is paving the way for the antichrist.”

But it’s likely to be an eerie, lonely, made-for-television affair.

A Sox season-ticket holder, Lightfoot said a decision on when and how baseball will return will be made “at the league level,” not by individual team owners, nor by the governors and mayors of individual states and cities.

But she acknowledged having “ongoing conversations” with the owners of both teams about “what that might look like.”

“We’re obviously a ways away from that because we haven’t seen the level of cases decline on a consistent basis. We’re still seeing them rise,” the mayor said.

“But can I envision a world where baseball might return to Chicago this summer? Yes. Is it likely to be without fans? Probably.”

During a City Hall news conference called to announce a new city app tied to the pandemic, Lightfoot also was asked whether she has any intention of re-opening the lakefront as the governor’s stay-at-home order drags on through the month of May.

“I don’t anticipate doing that,” the mayor said.

Lightfoot also was asked about following the lead of New York City, which is opening 40 miles of city streets for public use.

The mayor did not answer the question directly. She simply talked about a long drive she took around the city on a bright and sunny Sunday and being pleased with what she saw in terms of people maintaining social distance.

“People seem to be doing fine. I’m not seeing overcrowding in interior parks that was a concern when we closed down the lakefront. I think people are taking this restriction on movement in stride,” she said.

“No one thinks that this is something that will go on forever. But I think people recognize [the need] because we’ve been very up-front and transparent about why it’s necessary. What a difference it’s making. How we’ve lengthened the period of time in which cases are doubling.”

As temperatures rise, spring fever spreads and cabin fever intensifies, Lightfoot said it’s imperative for the city to stay engaged, keep listening and remain “physically out there and seeing what the needs of residents are.”

“We’ll make adjustments where necessary,” she said.",real
55,941,https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-rental-market-in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-14,"Somehow rents went up in Manhattan in April, the deadliest month of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's what it means.","According to a report from Douglas Elliman, Manhattan's rental market saw the number of new leases drop to a record low in April compared to the same time last year.

However, both Manhattan's non-luxury and luxury market market also saw an increase in median rent.

In addition, Brooklyn and Queens also saw increases in median rent and huge drops in the number of new listings.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, many Manhattan renters have opted to renew their leases for the year as they continue to follow stay-at-home orders.

In fact, according to an April market report from Douglas Elliman, the number of new leases in Manhattan saw a 70.9% year-over-year decrease to 1,407. According to the report, that is the lowest number of new leases recorded in a decade and the largest percent decline ever recorded.

The Elliman report credits that decline to the coronavirus pandemic, stating that ""new leasing activity declined at record rates due to the COVID-19 shutdown, while the market share of lease renewals surged as tenants sought relief,""

In addition, the report found that the April vacancy rate, which was 2.42%, was the highest recorded in at least 14 years.

But Manhattan's median rent price actually rose in the midst of these declines, and was up 4.9% compared to April 2019, to $3,650. The rental price per square foot was up 9% to $74.20.

Like the non-luxury market, Manhattan's luxury market saw a drastic year-over-year drop in the number of new leases, down 71.1% compared to April 2019.

And, like the non-luxury market, the median rent for the higher end also saw a year-over-year increase, up 5.5% to $8,650.

Queens and Brooklyn saw a similar April fate

Both Brooklyn and Queens saw the number of new leases in April drop by more than 60% compared to the same time last year.

In Queens, the number of new leases fell by 64.9% to 100, and in Brooklyn, the number of new leases fell 66.8% to 439.

""The record decline in new leasing activity due to the Coronavirus crisis indicated that renewal activity was where the weakness in rental price trends could be found,"" the report reads.

""Renewal leasing activity surged in response to the sharp drop in new leasing activity caused by COVID-19 shelter in place rules, skewing aggregate new leasing price trends higher,""

But, like Manhattan, both markets saw a year-over year increase in the median rent price.

In Queens, the median rental price rose by 4.2% to $2970. And in Brooklyn, the median rental price shot up 14.4% to $3,259, a new record, according to the report.

The rental market still faces obstacles, such as rent strikes, as the pandemic drags on

As of May 6, 80.2% of apartment households were able to make full or partial rent payments.

To arrive at that percentage, the National Multifamily Housing Council's Rent Payment Tracker surveyed 11.4 million units of professionally managed apartment units across the US.

The tracker found that May's 80.2% was an improvement on April, which saw 78% of rents paid, and a slight decrease from 81.7% in May 2019.

According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the unexpectedly high amount of renters able to make payments in May points to the effectiveness of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits, but some fear that won't continue to be enough.

If policy makers don't address the stress renters are under because of the pandemic, mass evictions, deteriorating housing stock, and a real estate or housing market crash are all at stake, a report by the Urban Institute predicts.

""We argue that there is a need for a national rental assistance program. None of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act programs provide that,"" the report reads.

The hashtags #CancelRent and #CantPayMay have been trending on Twitter in response to the growing unemployment rate. And a group called Westriketogether.org claims that around 200,000 people across the US have signed petitions committing to not pay rent until the government takes action on rent, as noted by the WSJ.",real

States including Alaska, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia have at least partly lifted shutdown orders in recent days. On Wednesday, Wisconsin's Supreme Court struck down Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order and bars and restaurants in the state have already started welcoming back crowds.

While no one wants to be furloughed or unemployed indefinitely, recent surveys show that Americans have mixed feelings about returning to work right now.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines to help businesses as they reopen. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), a workplace safety nonprofit, has provided some guidelines for retail, restaurants, salons, gyms and other service providers and their employees at its Back to Work Safely site. And USA TODAY's reporters and columnists have answers to some common questions people have as businesses reopen:

Must employers ensure the workplace is safe? And will they be held liable if employees contract the virus?

While health care providers must follow federal safety guidelines to guard against contagion, other businesses are not obligated to do so, leaving it to states and localities to set standards, experts say.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires employers to establish a workplace that’s “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees. To meet that standard, OSHA is advising businesses to follow CDC guidelines, including instructing employees to keep six feet away from co-workers or customers, taking temperatures, disinfecting surfaces, and providing face masks, hand sanitizers and barriers when appropriate.

In most states, employees who can file a claim through workers’ compensation must take that route and relinquish the right to sue. Meanwhile, winning such a claim can be difficult, with workers having to prove they contracted coronavirus on the job – a high bar during a pandemic. A better case could be made if several employees at a workplace contracted the virus.

“Even though it's recognized that some groups of workers are at elevated risk of catching a virus, there's still that reality that they may be catching it outside of work,” says John Ruser, CEO of the Workers Compensation Research Institute, an independent group that analyzes workers compensation issues. “The burden of proof would be pretty heavy for them to show that it was work-related.”

If your co-worker gets COVID-19 and you fear you'll be infected, can you quit and collect unemployment?

Generally, you can only qualify for unemployment if you lost your job due to COVID-19, you’ve left your job to take care of family member who has been infected, or you’re quarantining on the advice of a health care provider and you’re unable to perform your duties.

In fact, guidance in regards to the CARES act specifically states that quitting a job without cause to get benefits would be deemed fraud. You would have to prove you were possibly exposed to the virus.

If you believe your employer’s response to the possible spread of COVID-19 creates “a serious safety hazard” or if you think your employer is not following federal work safety standards, you can file a complaint with OSHA.

My boss is hiring people to replace those of us who were laid off, and reducing existing employees' hours by half. Is that legal for a business that received PPP funds?

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) does not require businesses to rehire the same people that were laid off. It only requires that the loan will be forgiven if at least 75% of the total amount is spent on personnel with the remainder on work-related costs, such as rent, mortgage, or utilities. If you believe your boss has acted improperly or illegally, you could contact your local or state labor agency to file a complaint.

I am concerned my job puts me at high risk for COVID-19. Can I ask my employer to furlough me?

You can’t refuse to come to work based on anxiety over exposure alone. Keep in mind that 31% percent of employers have laid-off workers and 15% have permanently cut the headcount with no intention to rehire, so asking for a furlough could be risky unless your company is already taking that measure. Your employer is not obliged to grant your request – and it could offend or upset your boss so carefully consider whether you want to make that move.

I have Type 1 diabetes, so I'm at risk for the coronavirus. People in the office are sick but are not staying home. Can I ask to work from home?

Type I diabetes can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Working from home may be a reasonable accommodation your employer could be required to consider. In addition, you are at high risk during this pandemic according to the CDC.

Talk to your supervisor about it: Outline how working from home won’t impact productivity. Describe what your setup will be and how it allows you to work well without being in the workplace – and take notes.

Do you have questions about jobs, money, or the workplace in these uncertain times? Please drop us a line.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined plans Sunday for a phased reopening of Britain's economy, citing decreasing coronavirus hospitalizations and deaths, and asked anyone who cannot perform their jobs from home, such as construction and factory workers, to return to work.

""There are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical well-being,"" Johnson said. ""To their futures and the futures of their children.""

Johnson — who himself returned to work last month after being hospitalized with COVID-19 — encouraged those who will need to return to workplaces to avoid public transportation and to bike, walk or drive instead. He stressed that workers would be protected by new guidelines designed to make workplaces ""COVID-secure.""

The prime minister said that starting Wednesday, Britons will be allowed to participate in ""unlimited"" outdoor exercise, but can only sunbathe or play sports with members of their own household.

As part of his phased reopening plan, the prime minister said elementary schools and shops could begin to reopen as early as June 1. He said parts of the hospitality sector ""and other public places"" could be cleared to reopen at the earliest in July.

Johnson stressed that his plans are conditioned on five factors: that there are enough National Health Service facilities and personnel to care for those infected; a sustained fall in the death rate from COVID-19; a sustained fall in the rate of infection; ample supply of personal protective equipment; and that ""exponential growth"" of the coronavirus does not return.

The U.K. has recorded more than 220,000 cases of the coronavirus, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, and more than 31,000 deaths.

Johnson also announced a new COVID alert system that will monitor how prevalent and severe the coronavirus outbreak is. The five-tier alert system will inform the level of restrictions in the U.K., Johnson said.

""The lower the level, the fewer the measures,"" he said. ""The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.""

He continued: ""We have been through the initial peak, but it's coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.""

Johnson's announcement comes as other leaders in the country have recently extended their stay-at-home orders through May and expressed frustration with his handling of the coronavirus crisis.

Explaining his decision to begin the reopening process, Johnson pointed to the crippling effect the lockdown has had on the U.K. economy.

""We must also recognize that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life,"" Johnson said. ""We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.""

Johnson said during his Sunday address that he had ""consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK"" and that there was a ""general consensus on what we could do.""

But leaders in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have rejected his new messaging on coronavirus restrictions, which advises, ""stay alert, control the virus, save lives."" As the BBC reported, they are sticking with the message, ""stay at home.""

""We mustn't squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that result in people thinking that it's okay to ease up,"" said Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister. ""Now, let me be very blunt about the consequences if we were to do that. People will die unnecessarily.""",real
64,1076,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/coronavirus-has-changed-online-dating-heres-why-some-say-thats-a-good-thing,2020-05-15,Coronavirus has changed online dating. Here’s why some say that’s a good thing,"When California issued a stay-at-home order back in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Dana Angelo, a 33-year-old copywriter at an ad agency in Los Angeles, found herself with more free time. So, out of boredom, she turned to a social activity she could still do from home: She got back on the dating app, Bumble.

Angelo said she’s been rotating through online dating apps — she’s also tried Tinder and Hinge — with minimal luck since getting out of a long-term relationship about a year ago, and had recently been taking a break. “You just see the same people on all of them and then it gets kind of depressing,” Angelo said.

But something surprising happened this time around: She actually met someone she genuinely likes. With the possibility of sex — or any physicial intimacy — off the table for now due to social distancing, she said it was easier to sort out matches who were just “cycling through people” from those who were actually looking for a relationship.

After texting for a few days, she organized a virtual date via FaceTime with the match she liked, chatting over drinks for about two hours. The third time, their FaceTime date was over brunch, for about four hours. Eventually, they took the step of meeting in person with a walk in his neighborhood — albeit keeping a 6-foot distance, with her dog in between them.

In the midst of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, a frightening global event that has negatively affected people’s lives in many ways, including causing intense loneliness and isolation for some, Angelo found a rare bright spot. It has actually improved her dating life.

“I’m not used to someone making this much effort,” she said.

“It’s an excellent time for singles to date,” said Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to Match.com and a senior research fellow at The Kinsey Institute. “People have time. They’re not getting dressed up to go to work. And most importantly, they have something to talk about.”

Not everyone, though, is keen to get into online dating, even if spending more time than usual alone at home has made some otherwise happily single people reconsider their feelings about finding a long-term companion. Not to mention that the pandemic has ushered in mass unemployment, higher levels of stress, greater strain for single parents and worries about fatal risks from stepping outside your door — factors not necessarily conducive to romance. While some have sought solace on dating apps, others are looking to online communities to connect with those who are also having a hard time, or focusing on friends and family who were already part of their life before the coronavirus.

Still, some daters looking for a relationship in the time of social isolation are finding opportunity. “Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other,” Angelo said.

Dating goes virtual

The popularity of online dating has grown immensely over the last decade, and is now the most common way that couples in the U.S. meet. A study by Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences found that 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting online in 2017, compared with 22 percent in 2009. The number was even higher for same-sex couples that year, 60 percent of whom reported meeting online in 2017.

Fifty years ago, a global pandemic might have hindered single people from connecting with prospects through their family, friends or faith communities. But these days, most people are connecting virtually to start anyway. “The influence of technology on our romantic and sexual lives has been so enormous,” said Justin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher at The Kinsey Institute. “From online dating, to texting, video chatting, sexting, etc., we have already been in the midst of a digital revolution for human courtship,” he added, so it’s not a huge surprise that singles would continue dating this way in the midst of a pandemic.

“Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other.”

The stay-at-home orders issued across the country have been a boon for some of the major online dating apps. “As a city goes into lockdown, engagement on OKCupid goes up,” the app’s global chief marketing officer, Melissa Hobley, said. Since March, the company has seen a whopping 700 percent increase in the amount of OKCupid users going on a virtual date. The app Hornet, which caters to the gay male community, has seen a 30-percent increase in social feed engagement since social distancing measures began in mid-March, according to CEO Christof Wittig. And the dating app Tinder reported that it saw more engagement on March 29 than on any other day in its history, with more than 3 billion users swiping to connect with people, according to an April 1 press release.

Once dating app users have made an initial connection, the way that they are getting to know each other has changed significantly during this period of social distancing. Most bars and restaurants, traditional first date spots, are closed down, and those who elect to meet up with a stranger could risk contracting COVID-19 themselves, or spreading it to others.

As a result, many singles have taken their meetups online, electing to go on virtual dates via Zoom or FaceTime, or through video chat features on the dating apps themselves. Recent surveys conducted by online dating companies indicate that members are more inclined to try this now than ever before.

A study conducted by Match found that while only 6 percent of singles were using a video platform to meet a potential date before the COVID-19 outbreak, 69 percent of singles said they’d be open to chatting over video with someone they met on a dating app during quarantine as of mid-April. Twenty-two percent of these respondents even said they’d consider entering an exclusive relationship with someone they hadn’t met in person, indicating an openness to cultivating relationships mostly online. As of the end of April 23, 51 percent of users on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel said they planned to video chat more, and 18 percent had had at least one video call with a match.

The outbreak “has sort of turned our social behavior upside down,” Garcia said. He noted that terror management theory — which suggests that people evaluate their environments and social interactions differently when faced with their own mortality — may explain why singles have been more open to trying new things during this period.

This is true for sexual relationships, in some cases. The Kinsey Institute recently conducted a study of a diverse range of adults aged 18-81, and found that while 43.5 percent had seen their sex life decline during the coronavirus pandemic, one in five respondents reported they had tried adding new things to their sexual repertoire, such as sexting, sending nude photos to someone else, or watching pornography. But it’s also true for those pursuing romantic relationships, as these people have had to reconsider what they want, and how best to meet and connect with people under lockdown.

“If we weren’t in lockdown and some guy asked me to do a FaceTime date, I would think that’s strange and weird,” said 35-year-old Nashville resident Maureen Iselin. But now, “I feel like it’s just socially acceptable.” After ending a long-term relationship in the fall, Iselin got back on dating apps. Instead of putting her dating life on hold during the pandemic, she recently agreed to chat over FaceTime with a man she met online.

WATCH:What COVID-19 has meant for dating in America

“It was a whole new way of thinking about dating. Like, do I get dressed up to this? Do I put on makeup? What are we gonna talk about besides the coronavirus and being in quarantine?” Iselin said. She added that going on a FaceTime date took off a little bit of the pressure because they were both in their home environments, and she planned to do one again with the same person.

“It’s a test of how well you actually converse, and you get to know someone in a different way,” said 26-year-old Naakita Feldman-Kiss, who has been conversing via FaceTime and Zoom with women she’s met on the dating app Lex, and has exchanged gifts with some of them. “There’s actually this deeper intimacy that I’ve developed with people, because … it doesn’t really allow for silence in the same way,” Feldman-Kiss said. “I really kind of like the slow burn of getting to know people over phone and video and text,” said Holly Samuelson, a 34-year-old from San Francisco who recently had a date over FaceTime where she and her date sketched drawings of each other (both are artistically inclined — he’s a builder, while she’s a fashion designer). Although the guy she had been talking to online lives 100 miles away, she said that distance seemed less of a deal breaker since California shut down amid the pandemic.

Rachel Ware, a 27-year-old project manager in Atlanta, recently went on a socially distant jog in a park with someone she met through Facebook’s dating feature, and managed to chat with him for a steady 3 miles. She said she actually liked being able to meet up with an online connection in the park because it feels safer and more secure than a bar, for example. “I’m a very private person and I’m very wary about security,” Ware said. “I like parks because they’re a public space, and you can meet someone and not feel the pressure.”

Of course, just because potential suitors are open to video dating doesn’t mean the connection is guaranteed to be strong. “There will still be time wasters who take phone calls for connection but it doesn’t mean when this is all over they’re looking for a relationship,” said Francesca Hogi, a love and life coach based in L.A. who has a number of clients that have recently tried out virtual dating, including Holly Samuelson.

For Justin Becker, a 33-year-old lawyer based in Washington, D.C., the coronavirus has more or less put his dating life on hold. He recently chatted over Google Hangouts with a guy he met in person before the pandemic began, but has not done so with anyone he met on a dating app. Becker said he had a hard time believing that video dates could move a relationship forward, with someone he had never met in person: “I feed off someone else’s energy, and I do not get energy through an app whatsoever.”

Embracing the “slow burn”

Before the novel coronavirus hit, U.S. couples were already getting married later in life than ever before. Helen Fisher said what’s happening now is increasing the amount of time people spend in a “courtship” stage even more.

“We’re seeing the emergence of a new phase in the courtship trajectory, which is meet online, talk online, then talk in person,” Fisher added. “Yes, we’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”

But, for some, slowing down has encouraged them to open up about priorities and feelings earlier on than they would have otherwise.

“We’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”

Connor Price, a 40-year-old who recently moved from New York to Los Angeles to work for a music nonprofit, found that true when he started seeing a woman right around the time California shut down. The woman, whom he had met through a close friend, didn’t want to put her mother in danger of contracting the virus. So she and Price started taking nightly walks in their neighborhoods, keeping 6 feet distance from one another.

“It also almost felt like dating in the Elizabethan era,” Price said. “If I could get, like, one little finger tip, in between her shoulder blades through a parka, that was like the most exciting thing I’ve had in a month.”

Gradually, the two have started to spend more time together, and even shared their first kiss of the pandemic while making dinner one night. Because their activities have been limited, they’ve had serious conversations early on about what they want out of a relationship.

“We had some very personal conversations much earlier in a relationship I think either one of us would have had because we’re spending actually a lot of time with each other. We kind of cut off the entire rest of the world and it’s just the two of us,” Price said. “Normally, these kind of conversations don’t come out for six months.”

Fisher argues that the coronavirus-related shutdowns have made conditions ripe for romance like the one Price entered at the beginning of March.

“When your daily habits change, it’s novel. And novelty drives up dopamine in the brain,” the biological anthropologist said. “The novelty is setting up the brain, priming the brain for love. It’s a very good time for romance.”

“I truly believe this is how you need to get to know people, anyway,” Price said. “This kind of slowed us both down and made us calculate how and when we wanted to do things. It’s been fun.”

Missing connection

Of course not everyone is looking for the sort of long-term relationship Fisher spoke about, while others who were content being single before the pandemic have had a harder time dealing with being alone as they stay home and miss the normal social interactions of daily life and human touch.

“I think the desire for a romantic relationship is certainly heightened right now,” said Shani Silver, a writer and host of the podcast A Single Serving. “It’s a lot easier to feel lonely, particularly romantically lonely.”

While Silver has shaped her brand around being “an advocate for single women as whole, happy beings,” she recently penned an essay for Refinery29 in which she wrote about the challenges of being alone during the coronavirus pandemic. After experiencing a serious bout of depression, she wrote that she suddenly felt “an instinctual, threatened, terrified loneliness that needed a hug and an apocalypse partner and neither were available. I didn’t know how long I would be alone for, and for the first time in a very long time, I cared.” In other words, it made her think, “I just want a f***ing husband.”

On the Facebook group for Silver’s podcast, women grapple with some of the same feelings that she’s experienced while holed up in her Brooklyn apartment, sharing stories about “quarantine” texts from exes or “one and done dates,” the struggle of being the last single person in their social circle, and getting through nights where they just feel very lonely.

Silver said she’s been irked by the ways that online dating companies have sought to capitalize on the pandemic by encouraging more people to make distance dating a priority at this time.

“What does that say to single people? ‘Don’t worry, we know how awful this is that you’re single. We want to make sure you can tell that even during a global pandemic,’” Silver said, criticizing the tone that some dating apps have taken in recent weeks. “It’s hurtful, honestly.”

Even on apps designed for in-person connection, it’s clear that many are feeling isolated and lonely at this time. On Lex, which caters to LGBTQ women, users post personal ads with headlines such as “Numb,” or “Quarantine Mood,” where they write about “feeling deeply unloveable,” “touch deprived,” or “bored and confined.”

While Silver recognizes that there will undoubtedly be quarantine love stories that arise out of the coronavirus, she’s more concerned about the “thousands and thousands of single people” who won’t meet a significant other during this time. For now, she prefers to focus on “connections we can safely have that are just as meaningful and that don’t involve making us feel like crap in the meantime.”

There are certainly singles who have sought to do this. Twenty-six-year-old Patrick Easley had been talking to a few guys on Hinge and Tinder, but lost the momentum when he moved back home to be with his mother, who is 60. “It’s this weird emotional purgatory, because people do want that interpersonal interaction,” Easley said of dating right now. “You can only date someone that you don’t know online or over the phone for so long.”

For now, Easley’s put off dating to focus on spending time with his mom, with little regret: “Getting to know her as an independent adult is really cool.”

We don’t know how single life and dating culture will be changed by the end of the coronavirus pandemic, but already it has seemed to challenge nearly everyone — single or not — to contemplate their closest relationships, and how they cultivate connection in the midst of a crisis.

Justin Becker said that while he misses physical connections with other men, he’ll be more thoughtful about how he chooses to enter relationships moving forward. “I tend to be a little serial monogamist when it comes to dating, where I want to jump into the next serious thing.” He said that this period of being home more often than usual has made him reflect on to whom he wants to commit.

In the future, he said, he’ll take the time to consider, “are they someone that complements you and brings out the best in you, versus just having someone to have someone?”",real

LOS ANGELES — While some parts of the country are seeing major progress in fighting the coronavirus, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, on Friday singled out Los Angeles as one of three regions where persistent spread remains a significant concern.

Speaking with reporters at the White House, Birx gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the nation’s progress but said the Los Angeles metropolitan area, which includes Orange County, is continuing to see problems, along with Washington, D.C., and Chicago.

“Even though Washington has remained closed, L.A. has remained closed, Chicago has remained closed, we still see these ongoing cases,” she said.

Brix asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with those areas “to really understand where are these new cases coming from, and what do we need to do to prevent them in the future.”

Los Angeles County is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in California, accounting for about 56% of the state’s total deaths and almost half of nearly 90,000 confirmed infections. The county’s death toll rose Thursday to 2,021, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases.

“This is a very sad milestone for us,” county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Thursday after the deaths exceeded 2,000.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis said she hoped officials could ease stay-at-home restrictions soon but urged caution.

“I wish that we could speed things up,” she said. “The virus is still out there waiting for us to let our guard down.”

Despite the average daily death toll, which has remained at a stubborn plateau for weeks, there were new signs that even Los Angeles is beginning to turn the corner.

The coronavirus transmission rate in the nation’s most populous county is now in its best position since the magnitude of the outbreak became clear in March.

Still, officials remain concerned that warm temperatures and quarantine fatigue could drive people from their homes over the Memorial Day weekend, resulting in crowding at parks and beaches that could threaten to undo some of the progress the state has made.

In San Francisco, the parks department painted 10-foot circles on the grass of four city parks ahead of the holiday weekend to remind visitors to follow social distancing rules.

It’s part of a pilot program based on a similar effort at Domino Park in Brooklyn, said Tamara Barak Aparton, spokeswoman for San Francisco Recreation and Parks.

“It’s going to be warm this weekend and we knew people would be out, so we thought it would be a good time to get feedback on whether this helps,” Aparton said. If successful, the circles could be expanded to more locations, she said.

In Orange County, several coastal cities expanded their beach hours and planned to open more parking lots connected to the shoreline ahead of the holiday.

Seal Beach, which initially allowed public access only Mondays through Thursdays from sunrise to sunset, is now welcoming beachgoers from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, officials said earlier this week. Some beach parking lots also reopened. Beaches are open for active use only.

A few miles south, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach also are allowing beach access on weekends, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. Newport is now open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., while Huntington Beach opens an hour earlier.

Laguna Beach, however, is maintaining stricter hours on Saturdays and Sundays, with its coastline closing at noon each day.

While Los Angeles County beaches also have reopened for active use, only some parking lots are open.

In addition to the reduced transmission rate, L.A. County has seen other encouraging indicators, including a 12% decrease in its latest seven-day average of deaths per day and a 15% decrease in its most recent three-day average for hospitalizations per day, Ferrer said Thursday.

“The progress we’ve made in slowing the spread, the reduction in the average daily deaths and hospitalizations and retaining capacity in our health care system — this lets us know that the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices made by all of you are working,” she said. “As a community, we’ve done this together, and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”

Still, she said, officials will continue to keep a close eye on those metrics to ensure they don’t creep up as more people are out in the public due to businesses and recreation areas reopening.

“Through our recovery journey, as we’re all out of our homes more, it may become more difficult to slow the spread, but it is far from impossible,” she said.

Though experts say it’s still too soon for L.A. County to move into a more aggressive phase of recovery, much of California has progressed to a point where officials feel it’s safe to lift more of the state’s stay-at-home order and allow more businesses to reopen.

The number of new coronavirus cases across the state declined from the previous week, and hospitalizations have dropped more than 15% from a peak six weeks ago, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis.

Most counties have received approval to progress more quickly through Phase 2 of the state’s reopening road map — meaning they can open restaurant dining rooms and more retail businesses for in-store shopping.

The list of counties that can ramp up their reopening efforts now includes San Diego — the state’s second-most populous — Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura.

That comes as officials revealed that California’s unemployment rate nearly tripled from mid-March to mid-April, with the state losing an unprecedented 2.3 million payroll jobs across all sectors of its economy as a result of the pandemic.

April’s jobless rate skyrocketed to 15.5%, up from 5.5% a month before, sweeping past the Great Recession’s peak of 12.3% a decade ago, state officials reported Friday.

The Golden State’s jobless rate is higher than the nationwide rate of 14.7%, reflecting California’s reliance on tourism, hospitality and entertainment businesses.

Still, some local officials are urging tourists to stay away — at least for now. Multiple counties have expressed concern about people visiting and possibly bringing with them the coronavirus, especially during the Memorial Day weekend.

Dr. Penny Borenstein, San Luis Obispo County’s health officer, asked tourists to not visit as the county reopened many shops and restaurants this week. While officials have performed “spot checks” with hotels to deter tourism, Borenstein said the county would cite visitors only in the case of “egregious violations.”

Remote Alpine County urged tourists to stay away when the virus began to spread through California in March.

Dr. Richard Johnson, the Alpine County public health officer, said last month there’s no medical care to treat visitors who fall ill with COVID-19.

“There’s no way we would even have ground or air resources to get them out,” Johnson said. “It’s a dangerous assumption that you can come and look at us as a safe haven. It is an unsafe haven.”

Communities in the Lake Tahoe region, which heavily depend on tourism as well, have issued reminders before the holiday weekend warning that leisure travel is not permitted.

On its website, the city of South Lake Tahoe said that while second homeowners are now welcome, other visitors are still not. Lodging will not be available to short-term renters.

“We would love nothing more than to welcome everyone to Tahoe right now, but that’s not the safest way to bring people back to South Lake,” City Manager Joe Irvin said in a statement. “We need to be responsible and make sure we are doing our part to keep our neighbors safe and Tahoe safe while adhering to the governor’s stay at home orders.”

Little did she know she would be called upon to lead Chicago through the public health crisis of a lifetime, one that would force her to close the entire lakefront and all of its parks and beaches.

On Thursday, Lightfoot reflected on her one-year anniversary with seldom-seen emotion on the day that Chicago lost its first police officer to the coronavirus.

“This isn’t the day that I thought it was going to be and thinking about April 2. But I’m grateful every day that the good Lord wakes me up and gives me the opportunity to serve the city,” the mayor said.

“It’s been the honor of my lifetime. When the voters of this city gave me such a resounding victory, winning all 50 wards by such a large margin, I was incredibly humbled and I remain so. We’ve been through a lot in this last year — more than, I think, anyone would have expected or anticipated.”

Until the coronavirus pandemic brought everyday life in Chicago to a screeching halt, Lightfoot’s biggest concern was her war on poverty and her plan to target 10 inner-city neighborhoods for an unprecedented $250 million city investment and $500 million more from other government agencies.

She was being pressured from the left to deliver civilian police review and more money for the homeless and affordable housing. She was also trying to tamp down a spike in homicides and shootings and choose a permanent replacement for fired Police Supt. Eddie Johnson.

Now, COVID-19 occupies nearly every waking moment. Every day there are more deaths. Even more people test positive. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Only a “pinprick,” as she put it.

Even so, Lightfoot said she is grateful for the support she continues to receive from total strangers who give her the thumbs-up—in spite of the policing role she never wanted to play that has fueled a hysterical string of memes.

“In this really unprecedented time, I’m reminded every day of how amazing the people in this city are. People are stepping up and really pushing past their comfort levels to be of service to total strangers in this time of need,” she said.

“I’m following their example and encouraging myself, my team and the entire city to really embrace this moment — as horrific at times as it feels — because the only way we get to the other side of this is by being lock-step together and knowing that our fate is wrapped up in each other. When the light at the end of the tunnel comes, it’s gonna be because of the sacrifices each of us have made in service of the larger good.”

Lightfoot was asked how she is holding up personally. She choked back tears, having just talked to and consoled the dead officer’s widow.

“In this moment, I’m very sad. … Those are very hard conversations to have. ... Having been through death and grief myself, these moments are so surreal and they’re so hard. I’m feeling that for that family,” the mayor said.

In an emailed message to her campaign supporters, Lightfoot marked the anniversary by saying it “helps to remember all the things that make our city great and the sacrifices we are making today to return to that reality.”

She added: “I’m looking forward to catching a Sox game, grabbing a pint at my favorite pub, listening to live music in person, shaking hands with worshipers at Sunday services and hugging a small child again — all without hesitation.”",real

Lincoln says it is still working closely with Rivian, including an “alternative vehicle” that will also be based on Rivian’s electric vehicle skateboard platform.

“Given the current environment, Lincoln and Rivian have decided not to pursue the development of a fully electric vehicle based on Rivian’s skateboard platform. Our strategic commitment to Lincoln, Rivian and electrification remains unchanged and Lincoln’s future plans will include an all-electric vehicle,” a spokesperson from Lincoln told The Verge in a statement.

Ford has put more than $500 million into Rivian

Lincoln declined to say what specifically about the pandemic led to the cancellation. “This was a decision that was mutually made by Lincoln and Rivian given the rapidly changing environment and after a review of product plans,” the spokesperson said. “As we moved through the development cycle, we determined that it would be better to pivot from the Rivian’s skateboard platform and focus our development efforts on Lincoln’s own fully-electric vehicle.”

Amy Mast, Rivian’s public relations director, said “Ford and Lincoln continue to be great partners.” Rivian recently announced that it’s pushing back the release of its first two vehicles — an all-electric pickup truck and SUV — to early 2021 because of the pandemic.

Ford announced a $500 million investment in Rivian last year, just two months after Amazon led a $700 million investment in the Michigan-based startup. As part of Ford’s investment, it announced that it would develop an electric vehicle that used Rivian’s battery pack and electric motor setup. It was reported at the time that the vehicle would be part of the Lincoln stable, something the luxury brand confirmed this past January. Ford also participated in a $1.3 billion fundraising round for Rivian that closed in December.

Founded in 2009, Rivian originally set out to build an all-electric sports car much like Tesla’s Roadster. But it eventually pivoted to an electric pickup truck and SUV. The company operated in stealth mode for nearly a decade until it unveiled those two vehicles at the 2018 LA Auto Show. It has since hired over 2,000 people and has opened offices all over North America.",real

Hundreds of thousands have died and millions of cases have been reported worldwide in the covid-19 pandemic, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States is now the outbreakâs epicenter, with more recorded deaths and reported infections than any other country.

Several countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.

On March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic âthe most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.â

The disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.

The U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.

In the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.

While the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, many countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in the number of cases.

As the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain. By May, more than 150,000 people had died throughout Europe.

Coronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

One of the oil industry's most-maligned products, high sulfur fuel oil, is a rare success story during the commodity's record-breaking slump during the coronavirus pandemic, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

HSFO is generally only used in industrial uses like in power plants and to power ships.

HSFO, as it is known, has steadily seen its price increase since the beginning of the crisis as oil refineries shutter production of oil, lessening its supply.

HSFO prices had tanked since last summer when a new set of rules from the International Maritime Organization, which effectively banned ships from using HSFO, was announced.

On Thursday, the gap between the price of HSFO and crude oil was around $35 per barrel. In November 2019, the gap was as big as $85 per barrel.

At a time when oil demand has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, one much-maligned corner of the industry is thriving, Bloomberg reported Thursday.

Prices for high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) have jumped to their highest level in nine months relative to the price of crude oil, the news agency reported, as supply of the fuel - which is generally only used in industrial uses like in power plants and on container ships - drops.

The supply level has dropped, Bloomberg reported, because refineries are producing less crude overall, which is in turn lessening the amount of HSFO.

HSFO is a form of oil that is, as its name suggests, high in sulfur, making it less desirable for use in things like automotive and aviation fuels. It is also particularly bad for the environment, and can cause respiratory problems in people. Bloomberg described it as ""oil's worst product.""

Coronavirus has brought a halt in air travel, pushed every major economy into lockdown and greatly battered the demand for gasoline and jet fuel.

""Fuel oil supply has gone down because of the run cuts caused by the pandemic,"" Steve Sawyer, director of refining at Facts Global Energy, told Bloomberg.

Prices for HSFO had plunged last year in anticipation of a new set of rules from the International Maritime Organization, which effectively banned using the fuel to power ships, removing one of its only real uses.

The rules, known as IMO 2020, kicked in on January 1 this year, and mean fuel used on ships is allowed to have a maximum content of 0.5% of sulfur mass-by-mass down from 3.5% previously. HSFO generally has a sulfur content of over 1%.

Those rules sent margins on HSFO down to as low as -$30 per barrel in November 2019. At the same time, US crude oil was worth around $55 per barrel.

But the gap between both is now shrinking, falling from around $85 in November, to $35 now.

As of Thursday, Bloomberg reported, HSFO margins are at around -$7.80 per barrel, compared to a price of around $28 per barrel for crude. The last time HSFO was at such a price level was in July 2019, Bloomberg added.

The price of US oil, West Texas Intermediate, turned negative for the first time in history almost a month ago and Brent, the international benchmark, touched a two year low in part due to low demand for fuel as the pandemic has tanked economic activity, and due to lack of storage options, particularly at a key hub, in Cushing Oklahoma

Prices have recovered since, but fears are mounting that the WTI June contract could also turn negative next week, especially after a US regulator warned traders on Thursday to brace for negative prices again.

The oil volatility has come despite efforts by the OPEC and its allies to reduce production. After a bitter price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia the Consortium reached an arrangement last month to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June.

79,381,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/technology/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus.html,2020-04-20,New York Needed Ventilators. So They Developed One in a Month.,"
This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series, which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve.
The nudge came in an email in early March from an Italian friend alarmed by how fast the deadly coronavirus was spreading in his country.
A shortage of ventilators, he told Scott Cohen and Marcel Botha, was a critical problem in Italy, and he warned that it soon would be in the United States, too. He urged the pair to apply their skills to the ventilator challenge.
Both Mr. Cohen, co-founder of a technology center for researchers and start-ups, and Mr. Botha, chief executive of a product design and development company, were skeptical. A standard ventilator, with thousands of parts requiring a complex global supply chain, was hardly a device that could be manufactured quickly and affordably.
“I was dismissive at first,” said Mr. Botha, whose company is called 10XBeta. “It looked impossible.”
But they soon found a design for a basic ventilator that could serve as their core technology. Since then, they have orchestrated from New York a far-flung collaboration of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, physicians and regulatory experts and accomplished in a month what would normally take a year or more.
The result are machines known as “bridge” ventilators, or automatic resuscitators, priced at $3,300. They are mainly meant to help less critically ill patients breathe. If patients become sicker, with lung function more compromised by the disease, they still need to be placed on standard ventilators, which typically cost more than $30,000.
On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the new device, the Spiro Wave, to be used on patients in hospitals, under an expedited process called emergency use authorization.
The project was initially targeted at New York City as a stopgap solution for what only a month ago appeared to be a looming, life-threatening shortage of ventilators in the city.
But the urgency has receded for now. While the city’s coronavirus death toll continues to mount, hospital admissions are trending down, and intensive-care units seem to have enough ventilators.
But health experts say a machine like the Spiro Wave should be a valuable tool in the arsenal of treatment. It can, they say, expand access to breathing assistance in other parts of the country as the pandemic spreads, and especially to rural communities without major medical centers. And capable, low-cost machines could greatly expand access to treatment in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
The New York group has fielded inquiries from across the United States and from companies and governments worldwide. It plans to license its design for free.
The project is one of several pushes in America and abroad to streamline ventilator design and lower costs. This month, Medtronic got F.D.A. approval to offer in the United States a ventilator that it sells in 35 other countries for an average price of less than $10,000. The company is also making the machine’s blueprint freely available to other manufacturers.
The hurry-up engineering feat relied on human networks; two in particular stand out. The original design came from a classroom project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a decade ago. Since the coronavirus outbreak, M.I.T. professors and students have worked to upgrade the design in collaboration with outside groups. And several key contributors to the project are M.I.T. alumni.
The other network is the government and business community of New York, where Mr. Cohen and Mr. Botha are based. The city government took on the role of a risk-taking venture investor, first with a $100,000 research grant and then a nearly $10 million agreement to buy 3,000 of the basic ventilators.
“It’s essentially a start-up that has made unbelievable progress in a short time,” said James Patchett, chief executive of New York City’s Economic Development Corporation, which backed the project.
The New York ventilator effort got underway after widespread warnings of shortages. In mid-March, Mayor Bill de Blasio held a conference call with top staff members. Mr. de Blasio recalled that the looming ventilator shortage was “scary as hell.” New York had no ventilator producers, but he told his staff to do and spend what it took to solve the problem.
The city’s economic development chief, Mr. Patchett, who was on the call, knew Mr. Cohen and his technology center, New Lab, which is in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mr. Cohen told him about the ventilator-design project that he was putting together. It sounded promising, and the city made its initial grant.
Later, on March 25, after further development of the M.I.T. design, critical care physicians from city’s public hospitals and two private hospitals saw the most recent version of the machine. That evening Mr. Patchett called Dr. Mitchell Katz, who leads the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city’s public hospitals.
“We should definitely do this,” Dr. Katz recalled telling Mr. Patchett.The project had launched about 10 days earlier, after Mr. Cohen, on the recommendation of a scientist friend in San Francisco, got in touch with Alex Slocum, a renowned mechanical engineer at M.I.T. whose class created the design in 2010.
A group of faculty and students — Mr. Slocum led hardware design, and Daniela Rus, a professor and robotics expert, led software development — worked to upgrade the design to help coronavirus patients. The device would have to be able to push air into badly impaired lungs at several times the force used to resuscitate a normal lung.
“This was going to take a serious machine,” Mr. Slocum recalled.The New York group began closely collaborating with the M.I.T. team. Dr. Albert Kwon, an M.I.T. graduate and a medical adviser on the project who is an anesthesiologist at the Westchester Medical Center, and Mr. Botha, also an M.I.T. alumnus, and others from New York made several trips to Boston for joint work and testing.
The M.I.T. academics’ goal has been mainly to develop designs and share information on a website. But the mission for the New York group was to make the low-cost ventilators quickly. The hub of that effort is a former perfume factory in Long Island City, Queens, that is now home to a high-tech manufacturer, Boyce Technologies.
The temperature of everyone who enters the brick building is taken, a precaution against infection. The 100,000-square-foot facility combines engineering and production with robots, a clean room, and circuitry and software design departments.
Manufacturing, engineering and medical experts have worked side by side for three weeks. Dozens of versions of the machine have been carted off to the dumpster, as upgrades and improvements were made. In recent days, M.I.T. engineers traveled to Queens to help with last-minute software tweaks.
“There’s a lot you can’t see in a model,” said Charles Boyce, the founder and chief executive of Boyce Technologies. “And if you can’t manufacture something at scale, it doesn’t matter. It’s not going to have an impact.”
Producing thousands of machines means lining up sometimes scarce supplies. One of those parts was an air-pressure sensor to ensure that a patient’s lungs were not overinflated, which could cause damage. Mr. Cohen knew that Honeywell was a leading producer of the sensor, and he tapped his network of personal contacts to secure it in volume.
Late one night, Mr. Cohen called Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group of the city’s top executives. Kevin Burke, a former chief executive of New York-based Con Edison, is a Honeywell board member. Introductions were made, and after a series of calls to Honeywell executives in America and Asia, a supply of the sensors was secured.
The New York ventilator project was intended to address a seemingly urgent need before large-scale initiatives — such as a Ford-General Electric partnership — began to produce ventilators.
While New York’s crisis has eased, Dr. Katz cautioned that pandemic viruses are unpredictable and mutate. A later variant, or second wave, in the fall could be less lethal or more, as was the case with the second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic.
“This is still a useful option to have, even if there is not the urgency there was,” he said.The low-cost ventilator, Mayor de Blasio said, is an “invaluable tool” and part of the stockpile of medical equipment and supplies the city needs as “insurance against a Phase 2” of the pandemic.
“We have to get through this first,” he said. “But for the future, we have to have an ongoing self-sufficiency effort in New York. What we’ve gone through should be a never-again moment.”",real

MGM Resorts, operator of a dozen properties in this gambling and entertainment capital, announced Monday the return of the treasured amenity, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

“MGM Resorts is updating many of our offerings as we prepare to welcome guests back, and that includes implementing free parking,"" the company said in a statement.

A start date has not been disclosed. In the wake of COVID-19, MGM won't open all hotels at once, but rather start with two or three targeted at different traveler budgets.

The first two resorts that will reopen with free parking when shutdown orders are lifted? New York-New York Hotel & Casino, a midprice hotel on the south end of the Strip with a roller coaster, arcade and Irish pub, and Bellagio, the luxury mid-Strip resort that's home to the famous fountain show, high-end shops and restaurants, a conservatory and a museum.

Parking strategy swing

In 2016, a majority of casino companies started charging tourists to keep their cars in the parking garages of Strip properties, a move that raised concerns that free parking would soon fade away.

In 2019, after experimenting with a paid parking model, Wynn Resorts broke ranks with the bulk of hotel-casinos on the Strip and announced free self-parking would resume at its Wynn and Encore resorts.

MGM Resorts will soon join a small group of resort neighbors — Treasure Island, SLS Las Vegas, Wynn, Encore, Venetian and Palazzo — that offer free self-parking.

In an email, Caesars Entertainment declined to comment on whether the company would join the unfolding free parking trend.

Paid parking woes

Paid parking has been a center of frustration of tourists remembering the old days.

“The parking fees are a gigantic deal for everybody. They gripe all the time about things they don't like. They hate resort fees. They hate paid parking worse,"" Anthony Curtis, founder of LasVegasAdvisor.com, told the USA TODAY Network.

One solution to paid parking woes has been avoiding casino-resorts that charge for parking, according to a 2018 Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance survey.

Data revealed almost 37 percent of respondents avoid parking at Strip casinos that charge for parking. About 7 percent said they visit the same hotel-casinos regardless of parking fee policies.

(TMU) – At the start of the coronavirus crisis, Twitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey shocked the world with his promise to donate $1 billion, or about 28% of his wealth, to help with the economic fallout from the pandemic. Now, Dorsey says that he plans to give away all of his money within his lifetime.

This week, Dorsey appeared on an episode of the “Yang Speaks” podcast for an interview about artificial intelligence, universal basic income, and meditation, among other topics. During the interview, he spoke about his recent philanthropic efforts, and discussed how the pandemic has accelerated the move towards automation and the need for a universal basic income.

“I live by the principle of everything is connected, so if someone is in pain, I’m in pain, ultimately, over time…I want to make sure that I’m doing whatever I can in my lifetime to help that through my companies’ works, through my own personal giving,” he said.

“I’m in a situation that I never imagined when I was a kid or [even] when I was 25. I didn’t have any aspect of what money would mean until I was, probably 35.I’m so grateful, but part of gratitude is not just saying I’m grateful, it’s doing. I want to give out all my money in my lifetime. I want to see the impacts, selfishly, in my lifetime. I want to make sure that we’re helping people,” he added.

The interview was published as Dorsey was announcing his $5 million contributions to Yang’s universal basic income organization “Humanity Forward.”

Dorsey says that universal basic income is “long overdue” and he believes that “the only way we can change policy is by experimenting and showing case studies of why this works.”

“Every single field is going to be touched by automation, and UBI to me represents a floor. A floor that people can stand on, and have the knowledge and peace of mind that they could survive and eat and feed their children while they are learning how to transition into this new world,” Dorsey says.

Yang says Humanity Forward plans use Dorsey’s donation to distribute small cash payments of $250 to nearly 20,000 people who have been affected by the recent economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Humanity Forward has given away about $2 million in financial assistance to people struggling in the current economic conditions.

“Not only will Jack’s donation directly impact tens of thousands of people in need during the current economic downturn, it will help Humanity Forward and our movement continue to make a case for universal basic income in the United States. We know UBI for every American is possible, and this $5 million from Start Small is going to help demonstrate what is possible for families across the country,” Yang said in a statement.

This donation to Humanity Forward is a part of the #startsmall initiative that Dorsey launched last month. Dorsey tweeted a link to a document where information about the donations will be posted, including the amount of the donation and the recipient.

I’m moving $1B of my Square equity (~28% of my wealth) to #startsmall LLC to fund global COVID-19 relief. After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl’s health and education, and UBI.

Dorsey has been known to make radically generous moves that are almost unheard of for people in his position. In 2015, Twitter was forced to lay off about 8 percent of its employees. Dorsey donated $200 million in Twitter stock back to the employee grant pool as a consolation. At the time this was about a third of the stake that he had in Twitter.",fake
92,1784,https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/2020/05/chinas-pandemic-power-couple-lloyd-billingsley/,2020-05-22,China’s Pandemic Power Couple,"Deep state doctor Fauci and corrupt WHO boss Tedros back the Communist regime's propaganda.

Last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus task force came out against opening up the American economy and sending the kids back to school in September. That touched off pushback from Sen. Rand Paul, a medical doctor, and President Trump, who for the first time publicly disagreed with Fauci. The president and his supporters, particularly those still unemployed due to Fauci’s lockdown policies, might check out Dr. Tony’s take on World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

“Tedros is a really outstanding person,” Fauci said in late March. “I’ve known him from the time that he was the minister of Health of Ethiopia.” Trouble was, the worshipful Dr. Fauci provided no detail on Tedros’ fascinating back story.

Tedros has long been affiliated with the Marxist Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), responsible for atrocities against the Amhara ethnic group in northwest Ethiopia. Tedros earned a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1986, but never completed medical studies to become a physician. During his tenure as Ethiopia’s health minister from 2005-2012, Tedros purposely covered up cholera outbreaks in 2006, 2009, and 2011.

The next year, as Ethiopia’s minister of foreign affairs, Tedros strengthened his country’s ties to Communist China, which has loaned more than $13 billion to Ethiopia. In December 2014, Tedros and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi co-authored an op-ed hailing the close bonds between the two countries.

In 2017, Tedros became the first WHO boss not qualified as a medical doctor. One of Tedros’ first actions was to name Zimbabwe’s Marxist tyrant Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador for the WHO. In 2019, when the coronavirus hit, the WHO mirrored the policies of Communist China.

In late January, 2020, after a trip to Beijing, Tedros said China’s actions “actually helped prevent the spread of coronavirus to other countries,” and the WHO boss was “very impressed and encouraged by the president’s [Xi Jinping] detailed knowledge of the outbreak.” Tedros’ actions, in turn, duly impressed Dr. Tony Fauci.

“He has been all over this,” Fauci said. “I was on the phone with him a few hours ago leading a WHO call.” That was in March, and back in January, Fauci told reporters that China was being more transparent than it had been during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003. According to Fauci, “This time around from my perception they look like they’re being quite transparent.” To all but the willfully blind, they weren’t.

Fauci earned a medical degree in 1966, but without advanced degrees in molecular biology he is not a virologist in the league of Luc Montagnier or David Baltimore, among others. At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Fauci made a name for himself with the claim that AIDS would ravage the heterosexual community. That turned out to be wrong, and for background see The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS, by Michael Fumento, and Inventing the AIDS Virus by Peter Duesberg of UC Berkeley, who is a virologist and molecular biologist.

Dr. Anthony Fauci’s shaky relationship with facts continues during the current pandemic. In January Fauci said it was unclear whether the coronavirus could spread person to person and cited a very low risk to the United States. Dr. Fauci said people need not wear masks and then contended they should. No more shaking hands, but according to Dr. Fauci it’s okay to have sex with strangers you meet online.

In press conferences, Dr. Fauci fails to focus on the number of coronavirus cases, the number of recoveries, the number of deaths, and the mortality rate. Instead of hard facts, the basis for decisions on the economy, Fauci touts various “models” that have proven to be unreliable. On top of all that, Tony Fauci praises non-doctor Tedros, hails the corrupt WHO, and claims Communist China is being transparent.

Examples of Dr. Tony publicly acknowledging his mistakes are hard to find. All told, he recalls the supposedly infallible HAL 9000 computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When HAL is proven to be in error, that jeopardizes the mission and leaves astronauts Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) with no choice but to disconnect HAL.

Dr. Tony Fauci is 79, older than the addled Joe Biden and a year younger than nervous Nancy Pelosi. Fauci has held forth at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for 36 years, making decisions that affect millions of people, without ever having to face the voters. If embattled American workers believe Dr. Tony has been in power too long it would be hard to blame them.

Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, a COVID-19 survivor, is right that Dr. Fauci should not make all the decisions. President Trump has good cause to disagree with Fauci and promote the earliest possible opening of the economy and the kids’ return to school in September.",fake

This is exactly what President Donald Trump, the FDA, and the federal coronavirus task force seem to be doing. They are fast-tracking experimental injections through clinical trials so they can be distributed en masse with the assistance of the U.S. military.

The federal government is hastening the scientific process and therefore polluting and corrupting it. The President’s âwarp speedâ demands for mass-produced biologics will inevitably cause unintended consequences, as biologics are unavoidably unsafe. (1 Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC)

These inevitable vaccine injuries will no doubt be swept under the rug and be handled by the Department of Health and Human Services and the special master of the Vaccine Court. This system was set up in 1988 to pay off select families of vaccine-injured children while granting vaccine makers legal immunity, preserving faulty vaccine supply. To make matters worse, the HHS has recently admitted in court that the lawfully required safety studies have not been conducted to improve vaccine safety over the past thirty-two years.

To heighten the coercion, several governors have announced extended state-wide lockdowns and restrictions, claiming that there will be no going back to normal until a vaccine or pharmaceutical is widely available. This is medical coercion empowered by the force of government â the likes of which the world has not witnessed since the rise of the Nazis. Not only is the scientific process being bastardized, but state governments are being used to punish certain businesses and suppress the people, to coerce the population to comply with upcoming, fast-tracked biologics and gene therapy injections.

The vaccine that the world is being held hostage for is coming along great â WAIT A MINUTE!

On January 11, Chinese authorities shared a genetic sequence of novel coronavirus with US vaccine company, Moderna. Just two days later, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NSAID) finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, allowing Moderna to manufacture the sequence for clinical trials. The NSAID is governed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead spokesman for the federal coronavirus task force, and the same man who helped fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology where China conducted controversial research on bats and coronavirus gain-of-function.

This sequence is not the only coronavirus mutation identified by scientists. This year, there have been over thirty coronavirus mutations identified, each circulating in different hemispheres and regions, eliciting various viral loads and gain-of-function properties, causing various symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to symptoms much more severe.

On March 23, it was declared that the vaccine wouldnât be commercially available for 12 to 18 months; however, Moderna announced that it could be available for âemergency useâ before the end of the year. Moderna was then awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to enable large scale production of mRNA-1273. The company announced a worldwide collaboration with a biotechnology company named Lonza, to manufacture up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year.

Now, this is a new kind of vaccine that inserts lab-grown genetic RNA material into your body, forcing an invasion into your cells. After the RNA material invades your cells and hijacks your cell’s ribosomes, it forces the cells to produce viral components such as the iconic spike protein. This vaccine-augmented, self-replicating spike protein, produced within the cells, is intended to train the immune system to fight. This manipulation of cellular protein encoding will never be adequately studied for safety in clinical trials, for it’s real effects can only be observed in the population over time.

The government and the vaccine makers have already prepared this biological preparation for mass distribution long before it had ever been researched through any credible scientific process, long before it had ever passed any serology efficacy test, or passed any animal safety tests, including primate and ferret studies. In tests on guinea pigs, 20 percent suffered serious reactions within 43 days, mirroring similar results that were obtained on the infamous SARS vaccine trials that caused pulmonary immunopathology in animals upon subsequent infection.

This new RNA sequence is currently being tested on people and rushed through human clinical trials so it can be released onto populations that are currently being coerced to accept a ânew normalâ until this cell-hijacking, gene-altering Holy Grail vaccine is available.

According to the pharmaceutical-funded media, this Holy Grail has passed through Phase 1 with flying colors. The RNA viral sequence and its accompanying formulation (undisclosed) has elicited an immune response in a small group of human participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years. This vague news has caused the companyâs stock valuation to surge to 29 billion, an astonishing valuation for a company that currently sells zero products.

Moderna is using the pharmaceutical-funded media to their advantage, blitzing the media with corporate success talk but providing little data on real life efficacy and safety. How will this hijacking of cellular protein production and forced augmentation of antibodies hold up over time and how does it affect human DNA?

Scientists at the NSAID, who developed the vaccine prototype, are usually quick to advertise their successes. They have made no comment on the phase 1 trial and are currently quiet on the matter. Moderna, on the other hand, trumpeted their phase 1 results, watching their stock market valuation soar. Their press release praised the development of âbinding antibodiesâ and omitted the fact that only eight out of forty-five vaccine recipients have so far developed neutralizing antibodies â the kind that are needed. The antibody assessment comes after participants received two doses of the vaccines and had their blood tested two weeks later. The researchers will never know if these antibodies are durable, whether they will convey any form of short or long-standing immunity. Moreover, this new RNA encoding and its artificial augmentation of an immune response could have repercussions as the immune system could attack the body’s own cells. Could these RNA messenger immune augmentations ultimately generate strong type I interferon responses, leading to chronic inflammation and inflammatory conditions?

âI would like to see the data to make my own interpretation of the data,â said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University. âBut I think it is at least encouraging that weâve seen immune responses with this RNA vaccine that we havenât seen with previous RNA vaccines for other pathogens. Whether itâs going to be enough, we donât know.â Two weeks is very early, she said. âWe donât know if those antibodies are durable.â

Upon further investigation, the vaccine appears to trigger the production of âbinding antibodiesâ that foreshadow the âpathogenic primingâ that caused deaths in early SARS coronavirus vaccine experiments that failed to come to market during the 2002-2003 outbreak. Moreover, there is a 20% percent âseriousâ injury rate among the extremely healthy volunteers in the high dose group, which elicited medical intervention or hospitalization. Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured was more prevalent in the young or the old. Lastly, Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured is harmful upon subsequent infection, is capable of causing autoimmune issues, or causes damage to cellular processes that cannot be undone.

Unlike the superstar basketball player, ESPN’s ‘The Last Dance’ is anything but great. It claims to reveal the man behind the legend – but is actually just a fawning, cultish piece of propaganda.

Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, and the much-hyped ESPN 10-part documentary on his career and final championship season with the Chicago Bulls, 'The Last Dance,' which comes to a close this Sunday night, claims to reveal the man behind the legend.

I’ll save you the suspense – spoiler alert – and let you know how the movie ends… the Bulls win a sixth championship and Jordan is never challenged… not on the basketball court. Nor, sadly, in this documentary.

Read more

'The Last Dance' isn’t so much a documentary as a piece of '90s nostalgia porn that serves as an exercise in sports media genuflection in the form of an epic, 10-hour infomercial for the Jordan brand.

The film’s alleged claim to fame is that it reveals never-before-seen footage of Jordan during the Bulls’ 1998 championship run. The problem is that Jordan himself controls the rights to this painfully banal and contrived footage, and in order to use it, producers Michael Tollin and Jon Weinbach, as well as ESPN and Netflix, had to make Jordan’s production company, Jump 23, a co-producer on the project. It all means that His Airness got the last word on what does, and does not, make the final cut of 'The Last Dance.' The result of which is more shameless hagiography than documentary.

As a business decision, ESPN and Netflix undoubtedly made the right one, as the film is being devoured by sports-starved fans in the age of coronavirus, and is a runaway success with sky-high ratings.

As a journalistic decision, though, 'The Last Dance' traded away any semblance of journalistic integrity for the golden goose of access. Whether it is embedded journalists with troops in a warzone, or the press making deals in the halls of power, access to power is always acquiescence to power.

Evidence of which is that the 'The Last Dance' doesn’t try to “Be Like Mike” with his trademark tenacity, instead it goes remarkably soft on its subject, and delicately dances around his pronounced shortcomings.

'The Last Dance' feels like one of those interviews with a politician where they are asked: “What are your greatest weaknesses?” And the politician answers, to much eye-rolling, that they “work too hard and care too much.”

Also on rt.com Michael Jordan reveals he wanted to sign with ADIDAS, not Nike, but said the sportswear giants WEREN'T INTERESTED enough

The docu-series reduces Jordan’s compulsive gambling and toxic personal behavior and bullying of teammates into simply being the result of his maniacal competitiveness. You see, according to 'The Last Dance,' even Jordan’s personal failures are because he is so great.

The film lays it on particularly thick when teammate B.J. Armstrong claims the notoriously bullying Jordan wasn’t exactly a good guy. Jordan self-pityingly responds, in essence, that his being considered “not a nice guy” is the heavy price he had to pay for his greatness. Jordan then breaks down crying and dramatically declares the interview over. Of course, the hapless director, Jason Hehir, doesn’t dare resist his boss.

There is another telling sequence in the film dealing with Scottie Pippen’s “quitting” on his team in the final 1.8 seconds of a playoff game in 1994, when coach Phil Jackson calls on Toni Kukoc for the final shot instead of Pippen. Jordan comments in the doc that the “quitting” incident ""is always going to come back to haunt [Pippen]…”

What is so striking about that sequence is that Jordan wasn’t playing on that Bulls team, he had “retired” at the end of the ‘93 season, supposedly because he was exhausted dealing with the difficulties of superstardom and the omnipresent media.

What did Jordan do in 1994 to escape dealing with fans and the press? Did he go into seclusion? Go fishing? No. He went, with great fanfare, and played minor league baseball, and then 18 months later returned to basketball after the Bulls failed to win a title without him.

According to Jordan and the decidedly deferential 'The Last Dance,' Pippen quitting on his team for 1.8 seconds means he is forever tarred by it, while Jordan, who quit on his team for a full 18 months, is beyond reproach.

The docu-series doesn’t have the journalistic courage to challenge the myth of Jordan at all. If it attempted to be even mildly adversarial, it might highlight that, unlike Jordan, fellow NBA greats like Magic Johnson (five titles) and Bill Russell (11 titles) weren’t jerks to their teammates, but inspirations.

Or that, unlike say Johnson or Larry Bird, who won titles early in their careers, Jordan had to wait until all the great teams of his time, such as the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons, had aged out of their prime before he could go on his championship run in an NBA greatly watered-down due to expansion in the 90s.

It also fails to notice that Jordan’s greatest moments during his reign came against lowly positional rivals like John Starks, Craig Ehlo and Bryon Russell… not exactly Hall of Famers.

Or that since his retirement, his main claim to fame has been a TV advert for Gatorade entitled Be Like Mike, set to the song from 'The Jungle Book.'

The bottom line is this: Jordan is undeniably one of the most aesthetically and athletically dynamic icons in sports history, but 'The Last Dance' isn’t an investigation or even contemplation of the man and his legacy, but rather a cultish coronation that unquestioningly embraces previously manufactured mythmaking. That’s not sports journalism, it’s self-serving sycophancy, and NBA fans deserve much better.

So a new mom from Michigan was forced to improvise.

Not only did Jen Laubach give birth to her twins Mitchell and Maksim eight weeks early, she did it while sick with coronavirus.

""These kids really came into this world against all odds,"" she told CBS News.

Doctors, fearing for the boys' health, immediately whisked them away.

""I gave birth and they were just like ... gone,"" she said.

Dad Andre was stuck at home. He found out he tested positive for COVID-19 minutes after Jen's water broke.

""She says I love you,"" Andre said, ""And we don't know if it's the last time we're gonna see each other.""

""It was like survival mode. Maternal instinct kicked in,"" Jen explained. ""You just want to do anything for your kids.""

She had to channel that instinct remotely, watching nurses at Beaumont Hospital, Troy feed the newborns until they finally met after three weeks.

Mitchell's now home, but not Maksim. Jen visits him five hours a day and now feeds him herself.

""The bond just grows day by day. And it's really nice,"" she said. ""Oh, jeez, I'm getting choked up,"" she laughs. ""It's hard work. For sure. With having one at home and one at the hospital.""

But after all she's been through, her newborns are her comfort and happy to be in his mother's arms.",real

Coronavirus Diaries is a series of dispatches exploring how the coronavirus is affecting people’s lives. For the latest public health information, please refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. For Slate’s coronavirus coverage, click here.

This as-told-to essay from Dr. Manisha Kumar has been edited and condensed for clarity from an interview with Rachelle Hampton.

I am currently the head of Médecins Sans Frontières’ task force for safe abortion care. It’s a relatively new initiative that started in 2016 to increase provision of contraception and safe abortion care in MSF projects. Before this role, I worked for MSF in many different capacities. I was both a field staff doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a medical coordinator in DRC and Bangladesh. Just like many people, I’m working from home now, in Amsterdam. I’ve never spent this much time in my apartment, behind my computer, on Zoom meetings and calls. So much of MSF and who we are is based in the field.

Our biggest priority is supporting our field staff who are encountering barriers or challenges to providing reproductive health services, namely contraception and safe abortion care. It’s hard not to be able to be there to support them in person. Our field visits are so important because that’s when you get to talk with our front-line staff and hospice patients and really listen to them. It’s through listening and engagement with communities that we move forward on a lot of these sensitive topics. When it comes to a topic like abortion, one of the biggest barriers is stigma. Abortion is considered a taboo subject that’s not talked about openly the way that other health topics like malaria or antenatal care are discussed. It can lead to a lot of myths and misperceptions. Even a lot of medical providers aren’t aware of basic facts, like that 1 out of 4 pregnancies ends in abortion, or that an abortion can be safely and effectively provided with pills.

When the COVID-19 epidemic first started, we were immediately concerned about its impact where we work, which is in mostly poor and crisis settings. Epidemics have a way of magnifying preexisting disparities and inequities. Our teams on the ground were already working with the bare minimum of needed resources. We know from past epidemics, especially in low- and middle-income countries, that the indirect mortality from the shutdown of routine services can be higher than the direct mortality from the epidemic itself. One example is the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and 2015 in West Africa. As part of the response to Ebola, a lot of facilities shut down or stopped routine services like maternity care, safe deliveries, newborn care, routine vaccinations. Contraception, safe abortion care, or treatment for things like malaria became exceedingly more difficult.

We knew from the beginning that maintaining these routine services would be key to preventing unnecessary death and suffering. The additional challenge for services like contraception and safe abortion care is that historically they have not been regarded as essential or lifesaving services. I feel sometimes that they’re considered minority services, but women are not a minority. A recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute estimated that even a 10 percent decline of sexual and reproductive health services in low- and middle-income countries due to COVID-19 would mean an additional 15.4 million unintended pregnancies, more than 3.3 million unsafe abortions, and 28,000 maternal deaths. Front-line reproductive health providers are already reporting thousands of clinic closures and predict reductions as high as 80 percent of health services, so imagine eight times those figures. The thing that’s important to keep in mind is that the true impact of these disruptions will be really hard to measure as women and girls denied care also suffer at home, hidden within communities.

So many of my planned field visits have been postponed. We had been planning on organizing this big safe abortion care implementation training for 25 of our field staff from countries all around the world, but, of course, now all face-to-face trainings have been postponed due to travel restrictions. It’s been really challenging to get staff into the country, and it’s also been really challenging to get staff who are finishing their assignments out. So what we see is a very overstretched, undersourced team. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have had to limit some of our reproductive health activities due to supply shortages. Globally, there are concerns about a shortage of contraceptive supplies because a lot of the components or ingredients of contraceptives were manufactured in China and those factories were not working for quite some time.

In some contexts, such as Bangladesh, for example, we are exploring ways that we can support what’s referred to as more self-managed abortion. It’s the past and it’s the future. Self-managed abortion refers to a person who manages their own abortion without interaction with the formal health system. In the past, that referred to a wide range of unsafe and safe methods. But more recently it’s come to mean people take abortion medications themselves at home with the support of maybe a telephone hotline or a website that provides information. Self-managed abortion has gained increasing acceptance by the formal health sector as safe and appropriate because, once again, abortion pills are just that safe and effective.

The biggest concern with COVID-19 is that people are going to be less able to access our clinics because of movement restrictions and government officials locking down areas once community transmission starts. During epidemics, people also fear going to health facilities because of the stigma associated, and they’re afraid of acquiring the virus. We have to be innovative, and part of that innovation is going to be developing more of these self-care community-based models, distributing condoms or emergency contraception pills that, in the U.S., people call Plan B. There are also now self-injectable contraceptives. That will help to see us through this pandemic, but hopefully will also impact the way that we envision health care or these services even beyond it.",real

Share All sharing options for: She left Illinois to be a cruise ship singer, got stuck at sea nearly 2 months by COVID-19

For the first 22 years of her life, Julia Lindsey had never seen the sea.

But for two months, that’s all she saw — day after day after day — from her cabin aboard the Celebrity Infinity cruise ship, stuck onboard because of coronavirus concerns, first outside Miami, then the Bahamas.

“I’m very, very frustrated,” Lindsey, 24, a singer working on the ship who grew up in Poplar Grove, about 75 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, said this past week.

She finally was able to disembark Saturday at the port of Miami.

“Yay, I’m free!” she posted on Facebook Live from a bus taking her back to Illinois. “Fifty-seven days on board, and I am off the ship and I am headed home!”

Maybe you heard in March that people were stranded on cruise ships at American ports because of safety worries tied to COVID-19. Though many were allowed to leave in the following weeks, Lindsey, till Saturday, was one of an estimated 100,000 crew members still stuck on cruise ships in or near American waters by the pandemic.

They’d been caught in a dispute between cruise lines and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the cruise companies’ refusal to accept responsibility for making sure the disembarkation process followed CDC guidelines.

Michael Bayley, chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean International, which owns the Celebrity Infinity, told employees the company finally agreed, allowing its workers to go home.

Lindsey had had her bags packed three times, only to be told earlier plans to let the crew disembark fell through.

She took the cruise job because “I’ve only ever wanted to perform.” And she saw this as a way to her dream.

She started work for the cruise line after graduating in 2018 in musical theater from Decatur’s Millikin University. She’d never been outside the United States before. She auditioned in New York after sending a one-minute video singing Heart’s “Barracuda.”

“Half an hour after I left the callback, I had a contract in my email,” she said. “It was very, very exciting.”

She’s gotten to travel to Asia, Europe and beyond — a big change for a young woman whose summers were spent visiting relatives on a farm in Nebraska.

Even for Lindsey, one of the stars of the show, this wasn’t quite Broadway, her ultimate goal.

“The audience members can come in as late as they want,” she said. “They eat, they drink through it, they’ll sleep. They’ll get up in the middle of it and leave.”

But the pay was good, so she could save to move to New York.

“I didn’t think that this was going to be that big of a deal,” Lindsey said of the pandemic, which crew members first heard of in early March.

On March 14, a day after her last cruise ended and passengers disembarked in Miami, she and other employees were told, even though no one had tested positive, they’d have to wait out two weeks of isolation.

“We had free rein of the ship,” Lindsey said. “We were able to use all the pools. We were putting on shows for the crew. We were just hanging out for a long time, just by ourselves, in the middle of the ocean.”

Nine days later, a crew member tested positive. Days later, everything changed. For nearly 2 ½ half weeks, employees were confined to their cabins 24 hours a day, with water and food left at their doors.

“I was going absolutely crazy,” said Lindsey, who shared a cabin with her boyfriend.

Her parents, who live in Belvidere, worried like crazy about her.

“You’re not being given any good information about the when and the how you’ll get out of it — that’s very troubling,” Lisa Whitcomb, her mother, said days before her daughter finally got off the ship.

Crew members eventually were allowed out of their cabins — for three hours a day — to eat in a “big dining hall.” On April 30, the restrictions were loosened more: They could leave their cabins as long as they wear masks and practice social distancing.

Listening to music, strolling on the deck, talking with her family and having her boyfriend, who’s the cruise ship’s music director, with her kept her sane.

“We’ve gotten to know each other very well,” she said. “At the end of every fight, I’ll say: ‘You have to realize I would never spend 33 days alone in a room with anybody. It’s not personal.’ ”

After all of this, Lindsey says: “I’m going to stay away from the water for a long time. I would never even come on a ship as a guest.”",real
119,1772,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/its-time-to-bring-grandma-killing-governors-to-justice/,2020-05-22,It’s Time To Bring Grandma-Killing Governors To Justice,"In April, Governor Gretchen Whitmer posed and primped on The Daily Show in a “That Woman from Michigan” t-shirt as a narcissistic slam at President Trump. That same month, that woman from Michigan issued an executive order, that the Daily Show and SNL didn’t mention, “protecting” residents of long-term care facilities, by forcing nursing homes to admit patients infected with the coronavirus.

Her order dictated that a “long-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on COVID-19 testing requirements or results” and told hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients back to the homes they had come from. Some nursing homes were designated as ‘hubs’ and coronavirus patients were transferred into them, even though these facilities had uninfected residents.

Despite claims that these ‘hubs’ would carefully separate infected and uninfected patients, that didn’t always happen. While there had been a plan to move coronavirus seniors to the 1,000 bed TCF Center in Detroit which was being used as an overflow hospital for coronavirus patients, they were instead sent to nursing homes. The TCF Center only ended up treating 39 patients before being mothballed.

As of now, at least 687 nursing home residents in Michigan have died in the pandemic and 290 coronavirus patients have been placed in Michigan nursing homes. These numbers are incomplete.

Next time, Governor Whitmer goes on the Daily Show, she can wear a new t-shirt, “Grandma Killer”.

In New York, Governor Cuomo’s Health Department had issued an order on March 25th to “expand hospital capacity” by forcing nursing homes to “comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to NHs” and warned facilities that, “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.”

It took over 5,000 deaths for Cuomo to partially reverse his grandma-killing policy which had killed 5% of residents of nursing homes in the state. It was a partial reversal, because nursing homes still couldn’t remove infected patients, but hospitals were no longer allowed to discharge infected patients to homes.

Cuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. “Older people… are going to die from this virus,” he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. “I don’t think there’s any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.”

“We’ve tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it’s virtually impossible,” he falsely claimed.

His grandma-killing administration had tried everything, except providing protective equipment, not sending infected patients into nursing homes, or removing infected patients from nursing homes.

Cuomo had tried everything to stop killing grandmas, except not killing grandmas.

On March 31st, New Jersey Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli issued an order stating that in order to achieve “the expedited receipt of patients/residents discharging from hospitals”, “no patient/resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the post-acute care setting solely based on a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.” It was a virtual copy of the earlier New York State order.

New Jersey’s own nursing home death toll is approaching New York’s 5,000 death toll.

10,000 dead grandmas and grandpas haven’t dented the media’s adoration for Cuomo and Murphy. To paraphrase another leftist, a single dead grandma is a tragedy, 10,000 dead grandmas are a statistic.

But before New York and New Jersey had even made their move, Governor Tom Wolf’s grandma-killing administration had ordered Pennsylvania nursing homes to accept “readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital” in order to “alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings” including “patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.”

Wolf’s Secretary of Health, Dr. Richard (Rachel) Levine, had transferred his own mother out of a nursing home and to a hotel.

“Dr. Levine has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we do what we need to do in keeping Pennsylvanians safe,” Governor Wolf insisted.

That phenomenal job amounts to 2,529 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes or 68% of the state’s deaths.

On March 30th, Governor Newsom’s administration warned skilled nursing facilities that they “shall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.”

“California’s directive is nothing less than a death sentence for countless residents,” warned Patricia McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.

“I’m not taking in a COVID-positive patient for the sole purpose of emptying one hospital bed. In two weeks, I’m sending them back 20 new patients,” Dr. Noah Marco, the Chief Medical Officer of the Los Angeles Jewish Home, said. Half of California’s deaths, or 1,276, have occurred in nursing homes, though not all are the SNFs that were ordered to accept coronavirus patients.

Whitmer, Cuomo, Wolf, and Newsom have been widely praised by the media, even though their disastrous policies likely led to the deaths of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes. There were states that got it right, protecting senior citizens by barring the transfer of coronavirus patients to nursing homes, requiring negative tests before a transfer, and creating separate facilities.

Cuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom, not only failed to protect nursing home residents, but their forced readmission policy brought infected patients directly into nursing homes, leading to mass death.

5% of the residents in New York nursing homes are dead, that’s grandma-killing on a genocidal scale.

While New York had banned testing as a basis for nursing home admission, in Florida, a “COVID-19 test must be negative prior to transfer to a post-acute facility”.

Governor DeSantis noted that his ban on sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes is the reason why the nursing home death toll was 13 times higher in New York and 25 times higher in New Jersey.

The media falsely claims that after at least 12,000 dead grandmas and grandpas Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did a wonderful job, and DeSantis did a terrible one. Their measure of success isn’t in grandmas saved, but in small businesses shut down, people terrified, and government power made absolute.

And if the media gets to write the history of the pandemic, that is what our children will be taught.

They will learn that in an emergency, wise governors listening to learned experts deprived people of their civil liberties and stopped a catastrophe that could have been much worse. That revisionist history will become the model for handling future crises. A big lie paid for in countless thousands of lives.

The big lie must not be allowed to stand and the truth must shake our political system until it rings.

“Who can we prosecute for those deaths? Nobody. Mother Nature, God?” Cuomo asked rhetorically.

Governor Cuomo says that no one should be prosecuted for the nursing home deaths. He’s wrong. The prosecutions should begin with him and tear through the bureaucrats who made and implemented those decisions. Millions of people trusted Cuomo and other Democrat officials to keep them safe. Instead they seized power, abused their authority, and killed enough grandmas to fill miles of cemetery.

The grandma-killing governors must be brought to justice.

When a violent thug was shot by a police officer in a small city in Missouri, the Obama administration came down on Ferguson with an iron fist. How is it possible that thousands of nursing home residents can die, that grandmothers and grandfathers, that 127 veterans in New Jersey’s state-run nursing homes, that 5% of New York’s nursing home population can perish with less care than the concern about a thug?

What do we amount to as a country if we not only let that happen, but let them get away with it?

Thousands of men and women who worked all their lives and paid their taxes, who raised families, who wanted to watch their grandchildren grow up, died in large enough numbers that their bodies piled up in sheds, and the same nation that ground to a halt for Michael Brown and Freddie Gray shrugs. Where is even a fraction of the outrage that has been lavished on Ahmaud Aubrey for those thousands of wrinkled men and women, black and white, gasping out their last breaths in nursing home beds?

Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did not believe that they were worth saving. If we do not speak the truth, if we do not fight for justice for them, then are we as a nation really worth saving?

“Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L on admission,” the study’s authors wrote; age range for survivors was 45-58; that for non-survivors was 63-76.

This study also provided new findings on viral shedding which indicate that the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors ranging from 8-37 days and that the virus was detectable up until death in the non-survivors.

Prolonged viral shedding suggests that patients may still be able to spread COVID-19, but it was noted that the duration of viral shedding is influenced by the severity of infection and of those in the study two thirds had severe or critical illness, and the estimated duration was limited by low frequency of respiratory specimen collection and lack of measurable genetic material detection in samples.

“The extended viral shedding noted in our study has important implications for guiding decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection,” explained co-lead author professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, China. “However, we need to be clear that viral shedding time should not be confused with other self-isolation guidance for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 but do not have symptoms, as this guidance is based on the incubation time of the virus.”

“We recommend that negative tests for COVID-19 should be required before patients are discharged from hospital. In severe influenza, delayed viral treatment extends how long the virus is shed, and together these factors put infected patients at risk of dying. Similarly, effective antiviral treatment may improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after antiviral treatment in our study.”

“Older age, showing signs of sepsis on admission, underlying diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes, and the prolonged use of noninvasive ventilation were important factors in the deaths of these patients. Poorer outcomes in older people may be due, in part, to the age-related weakening of the immune system and increased inflammation that could promote viral replication and more prolonged responses to inflammation, causing lasting damage to the heart, brain, and other organs,” said co-author Dr. Zhibo Liu from Jinyintan Hospital, China.

Median duration of fever was 12 days in survivors, while the cough can remain for a long time as 45% of the survivors still had a cough at discharge. Dyspnoea ceased after 13 days in survivors, but the shortness of breath lasted until death in non-survivors. Findings also describe the time of occurrence of different complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and secondary infection.

This analysis included patients aged 18+ who were laboratory confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 and were admitted to either Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital after December 29, 2019, who had been discharged or died by January 31, 2020; these 2 sites were the designated hospitals for transferring patients to with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan until February 1. 2020.

For this study clinical records, treatment data, lab results and demographic data was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors examining the clinical source of symptoms, viral shedding, and changes in lab results during hospitalization using mathematical modeling to examine risk factors associated with mortality.

Findings showed that on average patients were middle aged with a median age of 56 year; 62% were men, and 48% had underlying chronic conditions of which the most common was high blood pressure at 30% and diabetes at 19%. From illness onset to discharge the median duration was 22 days, the average duration until death was 18.5 days.

Those who did not survive were more likely to be older, and have a higher score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment indicating sepsis, and elevated blood levels of the d-dimer protein on hospital admission which is a marker for coagulation.

Lower lymphocyte white blood cell count, elevated levels of Interleukin 6 which is a biomarker for inflammation and chronic disease, and increased high sensitivity to troponin I concentration were more common in those with severe cases of COVID-19 infection.

Frequency of complications such as respiratory failure was 98% for nonsurvivors and 36% for survivors; sepsis was 100% for non survivors and 42% for survivors; and the secondary infections were 50% for nonsurvivors and only 1% in survivors.

It was noted that there were several limitations to the study including that it excluded patients who were still in hospitals as of January 31,202 as they had relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, thus the number of deaths found by the study does not include any of those patients and may not reflect the true mortality of COVID-19.

Also it was pointed out that not all laboratory test were done on all patients, so their exact role in predicting in hospital deaths may be underestimated; and lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high doses of corticosteroids, as well as transfer of some patients late in illness may have contributed to poor outcomes in some of the patients.",fake
124,1595,https://news.yahoo.com/online-programs-used-coronavirus-era-090032240.html,2020-05-20,Online programs used for coronavirus-era school promise results. The claims are misleading,"This story about education software was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. Sign up for the Hechinger newsletter.

Coronavirus school closures in all 50 states sent educators and parents scrambling to find online learning resources to keep kids busy and productive at home. Website traffic to the homepage for IXL, a popular tool that lets students practice skills across five subjects through online quizzes, spiked in March. Same for Matific, which gives students math practice tailored to their skill level, and Edgenuity, which develops online courses.

All three of these companies try to hook prospective users with claims on their websites about their products’ effectiveness. Matific boasts that its game-based activities are “proven to help increase results by 34 percent.” IXL says its program is “proven effective” and research “has shown over and over that IXL produces real results.” Edgenuity boasts that the first case study in its long list of “success stories” shows how 10th grade students using its program “demonstrated more than an eightfold increase in pass rates on state math tests.”

These descriptions of education technology research may comfort educators and parents looking for ways to mitigate the effects of lost learning time because of the coronavirus. But they are all misleading.

None of the studies behind IXL’s or Matific’s research claims was designed well enough to offer reliable evidence of their products’ effectiveness, according to a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University who catalog effective educational programs. Edgenuity’s boast takes credit for substantial test score gains that preceded the use of its online classes.

Companies that provide online learning technology try to hook prospective users with claims about their products’ effectiveness. But, as in the case of IXL, which claims its program is “proven effective,” the studies behind the claims weren’t designed well enough to offer reliable evidence, university researchers said.

Misleading research claims are increasingly common in the world of ed tech. In 2002, federal education law began requiring schools to spend federal money only on research-based products. As more schools went online and demand for education software grew, more companies began designing and commissioning their own studies about their products. There is little accountability to make sure companies conduct quality research and describe it accurately, so they’ve been free to push the limits as they try to hook principals and administrators.

This problem has been exacerbated by the coronavirus as widespread school closures forced districts to turn to online learning. Many educators have been making quick decisions about what products to lean on as they try to provide remote learning options for students.

Coronavirus learning: Is online school program backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg the answer?

A Hechinger Report review found dozens of companies promote their products’ effectiveness on their websites, in email pitches and in vendor brochures with little evidence or shoddy backing to support their claims. Some companies are trying to gain a foothold in a crowded market. Others sell some of the most widely used education software in schools.

Many companies claim that their products have “dramatic” and “proven” results. In some cases, they tout student growth that their own studies admit is not statistically significant. Others claim their studies found effects that independent evaluators say didn’t exist. Sometimes companies make hyperbolic claims of effectiveness based on a kernel of truth from one study, even though the results haven’t been reproduced consistently.

The Matific study that found a 34% increase in student achievement, for instance, includes a major caveat: “It is not possible to claim whether or how much the use of Matific influenced this outcome as students would be expected to show some growth when exposed to teaching, regardless of what resources are used.”

IXL’s research simply compares state test scores in schools where more than 70% of students use its program with state test scores in other schools. This analysis ignores other initiatives happening in those schools and the characteristics of the teachers and students that might influence performance.

About those teachers... They wanted respect. It only took a coronavirus pandemic and worldwide economic collapse

Edgenuity boasts of contributing to an eightfold increase in the rate of 10th graders' passing state math tests at Altamont High School in Utah. The claim is based on measuring growth starting two years before the school introduced Edgenuity, rather than just one year before. Over two years of actually using Edgenuity, 11th grade pass rates dropped in the featured school, ninth grade pass rates fell, then recovered, and 10th grade pass rates doubled – a significantly less impressive achievement than the one the company highlights.

Matific did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IXL declined to comment on critiques that its studies weren’t adequately designed to make conclusions about the impact of its program on student test scores. Edgenuity agreed it shouldn’t have calculated student growth the way it did and said it would edit its case study, though at the time of publication, the misleading data still topped its list of “success stories.”

More than $12 billion spent on education programs

When shoddy ed tech research leads educators to believe programs might really help their students, there are consequences for schools as well as taxpayers. Districts spent more than $12 billion on ed tech in 2019.

In some places, principals and administrators consider themselves well-equipped to assess research claims, ignore the bunk and choose promising products. But many people making the decisions are not trained in statistics or rigorous study design. They don’t have the skills to assess whether promising findings in one group of students may realistically translate to their own buildings. And, perhaps most importantly, they often don’t have the time or resources to conduct follow-up studies in their own classrooms to assess whether the products paid for with public money actually worked.

“We’re spending a ton of money,” said Kathryn Stack, who spent 27 years at the White House Office of Management and Budget and helped design grant programs that award money based on evidence of effectiveness. “There is a private-sector motive to market and falsely advertise benefits of technology, and it’s really critical that we have better information to make decisions on what our technology investments are.”

In 2006, Jefferson County Public Schools, a large Kentucky district that includes the city of Louisville, began using SuccessMaker. The Pearson product is designed to supplement reading and math instruction in kindergarten through eighth grade. From 2009 to 2014, records provided by the district show it spent about $4.7 million on new licenses and maintenance for SuccessMaker. (It was unable to provide records about its earlier purchases.)

Typically within the district, school principals get to pick the curriculum materials used in their buildings, but sometimes purchases happen at the district level if administrators find a promising product for the entire system.

SuccessMaker, which boasted on its webpage that it was “proven to work” and designed on “strong bases of both underlying and effectiveness research,” never lived up to that promise. In 2014, the district’s program evaluation department published a study on the reading program’s impact on student learning, as measured by standardized tests. The results were stark.

“When examining the data, there is a clear indication that SuccessMaker Reading is not improving student growth scores for students,” the evaluation said. “In fact, in most cases, there is a statistically significant negative impact when SuccessMaker Reading students are compared to the control group.”

The district stopped buying new licenses for the education software – but only after it had spent millions on a product that didn’t help student learning.

Students are ghosting teachers: Without in-person classes, many students have essentially gone missing, teachers say

Companies can grade their own software

That same school year, Pearson paid for a study of SuccessMaker Reading in kindergarten and first grade. The company said the study found positive effects that were statistically significant, a claim it continues to make on its website, along with this summary of the program: “SuccessMaker has over 50 years of measurable, statistically significant results. No other digital intervention program compares.”

An independent evaluator disagrees.

Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins professor, wanted to watchdog companies selling schools software to be purchased with federal money. The 2015 federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, sets guidelines for three levels of evidence that qualify as purchases: strong, moderate and promising. Companies get to decide for themselves which label best describes their studies. A year after the law passed, Slavin started Evidence for ESSA.

“Obviously, companies are very eager to have their products be recognized as meeting ‘ESSA Strong,’ ” Slavin said, adding that his group is trying to fill a role he hopes the government will take on. “We’re doing this because if we weren’t, nobody would be doing it.”

Slavin’s organization tries to fill the gap by offering schools an independent assessment of the research that companies offer for their products.

When Slavin’s team reviewed SuccessMaker research, it found that well-designed studies of the education software found no significant positive outcomes.

Slavin said Pearson contested the Evidence for ESSA determination, but a follow-up review by his team returned the same result. “We’ve been back and forth and back and forth with this, but there really was no question,” Slavin said.

Pearson stands behind its findings. “Our conclusion that these intervention programs meet the strong evidence criteria … is based on gold-standard research studies – conducted by an independent third-party evaluator – that found both SuccessMaker Reading and Math produced statistically significant and positive effects on student outcomes,” the company said in a statement.

Though the law requires schools to spend federal money only on research-based products, there’s little accountability to ensure that companies such as Matific conduct quality research and describe it accurately in their marketing materials. More

SuccessMaker didn’t fare well when judged by another evaluator, the federally funded and operated What Works Clearinghouse.

Launched in 2002, the What Works Clearinghouse assesses the quality of research about education products and programs. It did a review of SuccessMaker Reading in 2009 and updated it in 2015. The conclusion: The only Pearson study of the program that met What Works’ threshold for research design showed the program has “no discernible effects” on fifth and seventh graders’ reading comprehension or fluency. (The Pearson study included positive findings for third graders that What Works did not evaluate.)

The Hechinger review of dozens of companies identified seven instances of companies giving themselves a better ESSA rating than Slavin’s site and four examples of companies claiming to have research-based evidence of their effectiveness when What Works said they did not. Two other companies tied their products to What Works’ high standards without noting that the organization had not endorsed their research.

Online school is hard enough: Now imagine you're still learning to speak English

'There isn't a ton of great evidence'

Despite almost 20 years of government attempts to focus on education research, “we’re still in a place where there isn’t a ton of great evidence about what works in education technology,"" said Stack, the former Office of Management and Budget employee. ""There’s more evidence of what doesn’t work.”

In fact, out of 10,654 studies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in mid-April, only 188 – less than 2% – concluded that a product had strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness.

Part of the problem is that good ed tech research is difficult to do and takes a lot of time in a quickly moving landscape. Companies need to convince districts to participate. Then they have to provide them with enough support to make sure a product is used correctly, but not so much that they unduly influence the final results. They must also find (and often pay) good researchers to conduct a study.

When results make a company’s product look good, there’s little incentive to question them, said Ryan Baker, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “A lot of these companies, it’s a matter of life or death if they get some evidence up on their page,” he said. “No one is trying to be deceitful. (They’re) all kind of out of their depth and all trying to do it cheaply and quickly.”

Many educators have begun to consider it their responsibility to dig deeper than the research claims companies make. In Kentucky's Jefferson County, administrators changed their approach to picking education software, in part because of pressure from state and federal agencies.

Felicia Cumings Smith, the assistant superintendent for academic services in Jefferson, joined the district two years ago after working in the state Department of Education and at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. (The Gates Foundation is one of the many funders of The Hechinger Report and is a partial funder of USA TODAY's education team.) Throughout her career, she has pushed school and district officials to be smart consumers in the market for education software and technologies. At Jefferson, she said things have changed since the district stopped using SuccessMaker. The current practice is to find products that have a proven track record of success in similar student populations.

“People were just selecting programs that didn’t match the children that were sitting in front of them or have any evidence that it would work for the children sitting in front of them,” Cumings Smith said.

Jefferson County, one of the 35 largest districts in the country, has an internal evaluation department to monitor the effectiveness of products it adopts. Many districts can’t afford that. Even in Jefferson, the programs that individual principals choose to bring into their schools get little follow-up evaluation.

A handful of organizations have begun to help schools conduct their own research. Project Evident, Results for America and the Proving Ground all support efforts by schools and districts to study the impact of a given product on their own students’ performance. The ASSISTments E-TRIALS project lets teachers perform independent studies in their classrooms. This practice helps educators better understand if products that seem to work elsewhere are working in their own schools. These efforts reach relatively few schools nationwide.

Sudden school closures have complicated the problem as educators rushed to find online options for students at home. “This is such a crisis that people are, quite understandably, throwing into the gap whatever they have available and feel comfortable using,” Slavin said.

Online testing has problems, too: Online AP exam issues prompt College Board to offer email option. It's too late for thousands of students who will have to test again.

Slavin sees an opportunity in the chaos. Educators can use the next several months to examine ed tech research and be ready to use proven strategies – whether they’re education software or not – when schools do reopen, making them savvier consumers.

“Students will catch up, and schools will have a taste of what proven programs can do for them,” he said. “At least, that is my hope.”

After the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control bungled last year’s “EVALI” outbreak, one might have thought federal officials would have exhibited some humility. Or at least limited their statements to those supported by science.

But when it comes to tobacco and vaping policy, that’s just not the case.

According to a March 27th article in Bloomberg News, titled, “Vaping Could Compound Health Risks Tied to Virus, FDA Says,”

“People with underlying health issues, such as heart or lung problems, may have increased risk for serious complications from Covid-19,” Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesman, said in an email Friday in response to questions from Bloomberg. “This includes people who smoke and/or vape tobacco or nicotine-containing products.” “E-cigarettes can damage lung cells,” Felberbaum said.

The article went on to report that “Some health experts have speculated that vaping is causing younger patients in the U.S. to be hospitalized with COVID-19 at a higher rate than anticipated.”

It’s true. There’s plenty of speculation. Among those speculating was New York Cirty Mayor Bill DeBlassio. Back on March 8th, the mayor of the city which would go on to have the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world, stated that “If you are a smoker or a vaper that does make you more vulnerable” to coronavirus. Note that this was three days before the mayor advised that New Yorkers who are not sick “should be going about your life,” and frequenting restaurants.

The FDA’s claim that vapers with underlying conditions “may have increased risk for serious complications from COVID-19” is just about as useful as stating that people whose last name begin with the letter “Z” who have underlying conditions “may have increased risk for serious complications from COVID-19.”

Actually, with regard to the allegation against vaping, it’s not only useless, it’s harmful. The FDA’s unsupported allegation is likely to cause vapers to go back to smoking.

In fact, in the same article, Bloomberg reported, “E-cigarettes have been touted by some as less risky than smoking. But any increased harm associated with COVID-19, and the FDA‘s direct language linking the products to lung damage, could boost detractors who have raised questions about the potential that vaping can lead to health problems.”

And boost detractors it did.

As if on cue, on April 1st, a House oversight committee wrote to the FDA requesting that that the agency immediately remove all e-cigarettes from the market because their presence during this period would “exacerbate the coronavirus crisis.”

It took more than two weeks, and a scathing letter from scientists, policy experts and Iowa Attorney General Thomas Miller for the FDA to attempt to put the genie back in the bottle. In a statement to Bloomberg, the FDA wrote that whether vaping increases the risk of COVID-19 “is not known.”

For two critical weeks during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., the agency tasked with using science to regulate tobacco products and e-cigarettes, issued and allowed stand a false statement about e-cigarettes and COVID-19, even though it knew of no evidence to support the statement.

Since the onset of COVID-19, conventional wisdom has been that smokers are more susceptible to worse outcomes from Covid-19 because of the damage smoking inflicts on the lungs.

So the idea of making baseless statements and potentially removing vaping products from the marketplace in the midst of the crisis seems like an exceptionally reckless idea, as it would send countless former smokers back to cigarette smoking.

Already, former smokers are struggling to get their preferred alternative to widely-available cigarettes. Some e-cigarettes are available in convenience stores, but federal and state crackdowns and looming regulatory bans have already significantly reduced the range of choices available outside of vape shops— which states generally don’t deem essential businesses. If smoking makes COVID-19 worse, the essential nature of vape shops should be obvious.

While much is unknown about COVID-19, there seems to be one point that most scientist and policy-makers seem to agree upon, at least in principle. Policy should be confined to the evidence. There’s no reason policy related to nicotine products should be any different.

It is practically a textbook version of how to take down biased journalists – journalists who actively cheered for devastation after what they thought was an unwise decision to open up Florida.

DeSantis made his comments as Vice President Mike Pence looked on.

“You’ve got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York,” he said, speaking to reporters.

“‘Wait two weeks, Florida’s going to be next, just like Italy, wait two weeks,'” DeSantis continued. “Well hell, we’re eight weeks from that and it hasn’t happened.”

The Florida Republican also took aim at journalists for creating a “partisan narrative” over his efforts to successfully navigate the pandemic.

“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption, so they’ve got to try and find a boogeyman,” DeSantis explained.

Rich Lowry of the National Review recently penned a column asking, “Where Does Ron DeSantis Go to Get His Apology?”

“If you talk to Governor DeSantis and his team, it’s impossible to conclude anything other than that they have taken this seriously from the beginning, been immersed in the data and research, and crafted a well-considered response,” Lowry writes.

“Which makes it all the more astonishing and unfair that the media has been portraying DeSantis as a yokel who was going to get Floridians killed with his lax approach.”

Don’t hold your breath on an apology from the media. They’re too busy fawning over New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose policies actually did lead to ‘doom and gloom’ in his state.

But it was Miami Herald reporter Fabiola Santiago who really crossed a line suggesting packed beaches in Florida “should work nicely to thin the ranks” of President Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis supporters.

Santiago deleted the tweet and attempted to explain her comments.

I was trying to open eyes, minds and save lives, not create a controversy about me instead of the issue, which merits discussion. #StayHome #BeSafe #practicesocialdistancing — Fabiola Santiago (@fabiolasantiago) April 20, 2020

Contrast that with coverage of Cuomo, who issued a direct order forcing nursing homes to take in COVID patients, resulting in thousands of lives lost.

CNN had Cuomo and his brother engaging in prop comedy, never once mentioning the nursing home scandal.

Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld lauded DeSantis’ response, calling it “full Trump.”

“Maybe Trump is contagious, because man, that guy went full Trump and he deserved every moment to say what he had to say because the media held him accountable for things he didn’t do, and meanwhile didn’t hold other people accountable for things they did,” Gutfeld said.

“They didn’t hold China accountable and they didn’t hold those responsible for the rest home scandals accountable,” he continued. “They turned Andrew Cuomo into a saint while totally vilifying this guy.”

The mainstream media in this country is as corrupt an institute as there is. Good on DeSantis for calling them out.

They are not criminals.

More than ever, with the coronavirus sweeping across the country, there is an urgent need for their release.

Fifty-four percent of immigrants in detention who had criminal convictions were categorized last year as Level 3 offenders, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC research center. Their “crimes” were low level offenses, such as illegal entry to the U.S. or traffic-related violations.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Those people should be set free. Their so-called crimes didn’t warrant detainment and deportation in the first place.

Another 31,000 people were being detained who had no criminal convictions at all, TRAC research showed, and some of them were asylum seekers. It’s no crime to seek refuge in the United States. Yet “detention is the default to every arriving asylum seeker,” Tania Linares Garcia, a senior litigation lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center based in Chicago, told me.

Those who have no convictions must also be released. Many are held in detention centers where filthy, overcrowded conditions have been well documented over the years.

Since October, 10 immigrants have died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, and seven children have died while in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody or died shortly after their release.

That was before the coronavirus outbreak.

We know that packing people in tight spaces, whether at a funeral or a jail, creates a petri dish effect for coronavirus to spread.

Outbreaks of infectious diseases are common at ICE and CBP facilities. Typically, the flu is prevalent. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported an outbreak of mumps that infected 898 migrants and 33 detention facility staff members.

Detention facilities pose a greater danger than ever to the health of detainees and employees. By releasing people who don’t pose a threat to public safety, surrounding communities could be spared from a greater spread of the coronavirus.

As of Thursday morning, there were six confirmed cases of the coronavirus among detainees in custody and five cases among ICE employees at detention facilities, ICE reported on its website.

At ICE jails and family detention facilities, panic has set in because of the virus.

“Everyone is really desperate, and I think this is all about to collapse,” a father at the Karnes Detention Center in Texas said in a recording leaked to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.

Sick children were vomiting and had diarrhea, said the father, who added: “People are totally desperate because of that.”

Another father said that except for shampoo in the shower area, he wasn’t given any soap.

Linares Garcia told me that only a handful of the National Immigrant Justice Center’s clients recently have been released on humanitarian parole amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Overall, “there is no sign ICE is relenting,” Linares Garcia said. Detainees know they are sitting ducks for the virus. “The anxiety, the anguish is so strong,” she added.

ICE claims it is taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including distributing soap, but Linares Garcia said detainees that her organization is helping aren’t given soap unless they buy it from a detention facility’s commissary. Even then, detainees sometimes must make a choice between spending their money on soap or using it to place phone calls to their lawyers.

When you’re in a crowded place and must struggle to get your hands on a bar of soap, you’re in big trouble against a deadly virus.

Nearly 40% of all part imports into the U.S. come from Mexico, meaning the success of any domestic industry restart will rest heavily on a successful simultaneous rev-up south of the border.

Mexico has reported far fewer coronavirus cases than U.S. and Canada, but experts have questioned the veracity of the nation's reporting. Mexican officials say the virus has caused 4,477 deaths in Mexico, compared to 87,965 in the U.S. and 5,553 in Canada.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans on Wednesday to begin a phased reopening in his country on May 18, coinciding with a scheduled restart of production at many U.S. auto plants. By Thursday, the López Obrador administration pushed the restart date of its auto sector back to June 1, adding confusion to a situation in which automakers are desperate for clarity after nearly two idle months.

Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston, said Mexico's restart could be premature whether it takes place on May 18 or June 1 because COVID-19 testing there has paled in comparison to the American pace, which has been criticized for being substandard by Trump administration critics.

""By almost any international standard, Mexico has really botched (and) completely mangled the management of this crisis,"" Payan said. ""They've chosen not to measure the problem. Mexico is at the bottom of the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries at least in terms of rational record keeping of deaths. They just don't know.""

Payan said Mexico has conducted about one-half of one test per 1,000 people, compared to a U.S. rate of about 27 or 28 people per 1,000 residents.

""At this stage of the pandemic, there's no way to know the scope of the problem if you refuse to test,"" he said. ""The numbers in Mexico are based on people who have been hospitalized or have shown very serious symptoms. The multiplier could be many times more.""

In addition to the testing challenges, Payan said Mexico has experienced many of the problems that dogged the U.S. in the early days of its efforts to ramp up federal and state responses to the coronavirus.

""It's mainly the same issues other countries are facing,"" he said. ""No personal protection equipment — it's dismal. Health care systems are overwhelmed. Hospitals in Mexico City are full.""

The uncertainty presents a major problem for automakers as the U.S. industry attempts to rev up. Already, at least one company, Daimler AG, has suspended production of SUVs at one of the first U.S. plants to reopen in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, due to a shortage of Mexican parts.

""In the first week of the ramp-up, (Mercedes-Benz U.S. International) has begun limited production with a significantly reduced number of team members in 1 shift,"" the company said in a statement that was provided to The Detroit News. ""Due to respective country-specific regulations and their impact on international supplier sites, we expect temporary interruptions.""

Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at Ann Arbor's Center for Automotive Research, said the problems easily could be exacerbated if Mexico handles its coronavirus restart poorly.

""There are very few models that don't have some Mexican content,"" Dziczek said, noting that 39% of all part imports into the U.S. in 2019 came from Mexico. ""A synchronized restart with Mexico is really critical. You need all the parts to make a car.""

Dziczek said Mexico is a critical source for several important parts that are used to build cars in domestic plants, such as wiring harnesses used to connect critical electronic systems within vehicles.

""Eighty percent of wiring harnesses come through the Mexican border,"" she said. ""You can't build a car without the wires. It's not something that we make very many of domestically because it's very labor intensive.""

The López Obrador administration's restart plan calls for a color-coded alert system (red, orange, yellow, and green) similar to the one used previously by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for terror threats that will be used to notify Mexicans of the level of activities that are allowed in a given state at the time.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies for automakers in Washington, said in a statement the industry's' ""focus continues to be on the health and safety of our team members, customers and communities.

""With production facilities, supply chains and other vital operations located throughout the U.S. and North American region, we appreciate the ongoing support and engagement from the administration — as well as state, local and regional partners — as we move toward the safe resumption of operations,” he said.

Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader, said the availability of Mexican parts is a major concern: ""Automakers are relying heavily on Mexico to build an adequate supply of parts so they can smoothly restart assembly plants and not have to stop and start again for lack of parts.""

153,527,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/remdesivir-showing-promise-some-covid-19-patients/,2020-04-30,Remdesivir Showing Promise In Some COVID-19 Patients,"Gilead’s drug candidate Remdesivir is showing some signs of positive proof of concept in hospitalized COVID-19 patients; it outperformed placebo by 31% in a clinical trial sponsored by the NIH according to the agency.

NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease has released preliminary data showing the study meeting the primary outcome of statistical improvement in time to recovery by day 29; patients who were treated showed a median time to recovery of 22 days compared to 15 days for those receiving placebo. Additional data will be released while the study with results is being submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

“Although a 31% improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout 100%, it is a very important proof of concept. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, said today during an appearance with President Donald Trump. “This will be the standard of care.” To which the president added, “It’s a beginning. That means you build on it. But it’s a very positive event.”

This is the first clinical study launched in America of a possible therapeutic for the COVID-19 virus. Remdesivir is among 18 other candidates that are designated as being the front runners among over 160 other possible therapeutics that are under study that can be viewed in GEN updated A-List by clicking here.

Remdesivir had a mortality rate of 8% compared to 11% of those receiving placebo, the agency suggests that this is a survival benefit to the nucleotide prodrug. This trial (ACCTT; NCT04280705) is an adaptive, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial evaluating 1,063 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a broad range of symptoms; and is one of three randomized blinded Phase III studies assessing the drug candidate involving a total of 68 sites (47 in America and 21 in Europe and Asia).

“Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery,” NIAID stated. “Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level.”

“Accumulating data on Remdesivir suggests it’s active against COVID and there’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization by FDA. The data from NIAID study should push this firmly over the line,” writes Scott Gottlieb, MD, former FDA Commissioner.

However, not everyone is as excited including Eric Topol, MD, who is the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute who cautions “The new remdesivir data from Tony Fauci from N >1,000 placebo-controlled trial (unpublished, Oval Office citation) does not show statistically significant reduction in mortality (8% vs 11%, in the right direction) but a clear-cut benefit in time to recovery 11 vs 15 days, P<0.001.”

This was just one of the two remdesivir studies that data was released for, as the Lancet published results showing that the drug candidate failed to show clinical improvements in severely infected patients in a Chinese Phase III trial (NCT04257656); this trial was a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled multicenter trial in which remdesivir failed to reduce the presence of the virus in the bloodstream of 158 patients who were treated with the candidate in the 237 patient trial.

Primary endpoint in this trial was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, the average time to clinical improvement was 21 days for those treated and 23 for those receiving placebo. 28 days after treatment 13.9% of those in the remdesivir cohort died compared to 12.8% of the placebo group. Of the secondary outcomes 11.3% in the treatment group died within 10 days of illness onset compared to 14.9% of the placebo group.11.6% of the treatment group were taken off of the drug candidate due to side effects compared to 5.1% of the placebo group; adverse effects were reported from 65.8% of the remdesivir group compared to 64.1% of the placebo group.

University of Chicago, which is one of the treatment sites cautions, “Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”",fake

Some types of masks are not intended for reuse, but there are a few things you can do to sanitize them, upgrade filtration and extend their lives. Here are some strategies that will help you get the most out of your mask, and keep you and your family safe.

Let's say you just got back from the grocery store wearing your mask. Now what?

1. Treat your mask like a biohazard.

Isolate it from the rest of your family. “You don't want to be leaving it on the kitchen counter or the coffee table where other people may inadvertently be handling it,” says Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

2. Wash your hands with soap every time you remove or even touch the mask.

Act as if the virus is on both sides of the fabric. Make sure to wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds.

Those are coronavirus mask basics.

There’s much more to know, though, if you want to extend the life of your gear or even make your own mask.

How to clean homemade cloth face masks and the best material to make one

To clean your mask, run it through the washing machine and dryer after use. The water doesn't necessarily needs to be hot but make sure to use a laundry detergent.

If you don't have access to a washing machine, you can hand-wash using soap. Another option: Put the mask into a paper bag and leave it in a warm place for at least two days. After that, the virus will become inactive and won’t be infectious.

When you are wearing a homemade mask, you should keep in mind that you are not wearing the mask to protect yourself, but to minimize the spread of virus particles to others. Even if you feel no effects, you may be asymptomatic.

Homemade masks are less effective at protecting the wearer because most have voids, or spaces near your nose and cheeks where the tiny droplets can be inhaled, and the pores in the fabric alone are generally not small enough to trap tiny aerosolized droplets.

Some materials make better masks than than others. According to a study published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, homemade masks made from a kitchen towel proved to be the most effective at removing particles.

On the other hand, T-shirts or pillowcases may be the best choice as they can provide a better fit by stretching. Avoid using old fabrics because washing and drying may stretch the pores, allowing more particles to get in.

The choice of fabric is very important. Professor Koehler suggests using tightly woven fabric folded in multiple layers. A research paper published in PeerJ confirms the fabric concern. The study looked at the surface of 20 different types of cloth masks and found the size of pores in masks ranged from 80 to 500 micrometers. For comparison, the novel coronavirus is about 0.12 micrometers:

You may also want to avoid thick materials like vacuum cleaner bags. A material with high resistance will force air to escape through routes around the mask fabric creating a void. Also, breathing through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk.

""It shouldn't be so difficult that you just can't physically breathe, but you should notice some resistance in your breathing,"" Dr. Koehler said. ""Otherwise your mask is probably not doing anything.""

Adding any sort of filtering inside the mask may help to reinforce it and add additional protection. An engineer specializing in aerodynamics has tested the effectiveness of paper towels. A single layer captured 23% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. Adding an extra layer increased particle capture to 33%.

Phillip Clapp, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina, has been testing various homemade masks. When he studied three layers of cotton fabric, he saw that the material itself had efficiency of around 90%. However, once he wore the mask made from that material, its efficiency dropped below 50%.

""And what that tells us is that it really has to do with how well that mask will fit your face, as to how well you'll be protected,"" Dr. Clapp said.

The mask should cover both your nose and mouth. The CDC has published several tutorials on making face masks, which include masks with elastic ear loops as well as tie strings. If you choose to make a mask with tie strings, it's important to make sure the straps fit correctly around the head so the mask does not fall down.

When wearing a mask, secure the bottom ties first with a bow around the nape of your neck. Then, pull the mask by the upper ties over your mouth and chin and secure around your head.

Preliminary results from a study by researchers at Northeastern University show that sewn fabric masks can in some cases approach the filtration efficiency of commercially produced masks.

Adding an elastic outer layer improved fit for all mask types tested. Particularly helpful was adding an outer layer made from nylon stockings. Even surgical masks were found to perform better with stockings during the study.

You should not clean an N95 mask at home. But you can reuse it with proper care. Here's how:

The general public is asked not to purchase N95 respirators due to shortages in the medical supply. But if you have one, they offer good protection. The key with the N95 respirator is proper fit: There should be no air gaps or voids around the nose, cheeks or chin.

According to Koehler, some data suggests that the virus could live on N95 respirators up to seven days, as opposed to about two days for the cloth fabrics.

She recommends using a method that isolates the mask in a breathable location:

Never use cleaning products such as Lysol, alcohol or bleach. Liquid, including soap and water, can damage the mesh of electrically charged fibers designed to catch particles and droplets.

Can you use expired face masks and respirators?

Expired N95 respirators remain as effective as the new ones, Clapp said. He tested respirators that were as far as 11 years behind the expiration date. While the respirator may still filter particles as good as new, elastic bands that may deteriorate.

Can you clean and reuse disposable surgical masks? Sort of. Here's how:

Surgical masks are intended to protect the wearer’s face from large droplets and splashes of blood and other body fluids. Efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% depending on the manufacturer and the type of the mask. According to Clapp, surgical masks with ear loops (38.9% effective) performed worse than surgical masks with tie strings (71.5% effective.)

Generally, surgical masks are less effective than N95 respirators because they don’t provide a seal around the nose and mouth, which could allow smaller droplets to get in. At the same time, studies show that they are better than homemade masks at protecting from larger particles.

Ana Rule, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recommends not buying surgical masks to ensure enough supply for health care workers. Wear one only if you have it already at home.

How to reuse: The best strategy is to isolate it for a week in a breathable container such as a paper bag. Putting masks in the plastic may lead to accumulation of moisture and development of bacteria. Surgical masks should not be washed, because liquid damages the filter.

How to clean and reuse elastomeric respirators

When elastomeric respirators are properly fit tested and worn, they can provide the user with an effective face seal and will hold up to repeated use, cleaning and maintenance. As with N95 masks, use only if you already have one.

How to clean and reuse the respirator: Wipe down with alcohol swabs to disinfection after each use. The attached filter cartridges are replaceable and are easily changed. Though they can be reused, their life span depends on many factors such as exposure and concentration of particles. It's important to double check if the cartridges you have are designated for filtering coronavirus particles.

Using masks in the family

The best practice is just for one person within a family to go to a store or other places where it might be difficult to maintain social distancing. Parents should ensure that children don't touch their face, because wearing the mask may encourage them to do so. CDC recommends that children under 2 years old shouldn't wear the mask because of the risk of suffocation.",real

Stories Post-virus future: 4 trends that will shape the global economy

As the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, the media have been rife with predictions of an imminent economic crisis of historic proportions. The scenarios range from apocalyptic to slightly less so, which is understandable, since a cure for COVID-19 has yet to be found, and a vaccine isn't expected any time soon. The more optimistic prognosis envisages this as a chance to remake society and build a better future.

""The Great Lockdown""

The IMF predicts that the world will 'very likely' experience the worst recession since the 1930s, and expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, which is a sharp downturn after years of continuous growth. Strict social distancing orders and lockdowns implemented by authorities around the world brought much global economic activity to a halt. The FTSE, Dow Jones and the Nikkei indices have all seen massive falls since the outbreak began. Global trade could, by various estimates, plummet by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the crisis.

According to Goldman Sachs, the United States GDP is projected to nosedive by 24% in the second quarter of the year. And when GDP plummets, people lose jobs.

In April the US unemployment rate soared to 14.7%, which is worse than at any time since the Great Depression (and just two months ago it was at 3.5%).

In China, some 80 million people may already be out of work, with more to join them. The pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade and is putting a significant strain on national healthcare systems. Travel restrictions implemented by nearly 100 countries have left tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors, and transportation services in a shambles.

The IMF has dubbed the current crisis ""the Great Lockdown"".

With the global health emergency adding an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the equation, the leading economists and global thinkers map out a new life after the virus. Here are the four principle trends likely to shape the global economy in the post-COVID era.

New isolationism (aka ""islandisation"")

The virus spreads with movement. Since the start of the pandemic, governments have tightened travel regulations between and within countries, which are likely to stay in place with varying degrees of severity at least through the end of the year.

While most epidemiologists agree the current virus outbreak will last between 18 and 24 months, coming back in waves of different intensity, borders can't possibly stay locked for that long.

Many countries are currently preparing to reopen – whether based on improved health data or due to the inability to sustain losses caused by the lockdown/Lei Jiang via Unsplash

To facilitate limited cross-border movement, group-based isolation models are already coming into play. Australia and New Zealand have committed to introducing a trans-Tasmanian ""COVID-safe travel zone"", the Baltic states are creating a ""travel bubble"" for their citizens. In contrast, the European Commission has released guidelines for lifting travel restrictions ""between areas or member states with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations"". Greece, on the other hand, is planning to mandate so-called ""health passports"" for tourists entering the country – such travellers will be waived an otherwise mandatory quarantine. Similar steps will be, likely, taken by other countries in an attempt to renew international travel, yet prevent new virus outbreaks.

These isolation models may result in stratification of society into two groups: those who'd developed immunity and those who haven't.

Speculation about the introduction of the so-called ""immunity passports"" for US citizens have been circulating for quite some time now. Still, civil right activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union – the country's largest civil rights group, – are sceptical about the idea. The thinking behind it is to identify those that could safely return to work and resume travel. This would disproportionately hurt the non-immune population and jeopardise civil rights and liberties – perhaps even tempting some to get sick just to develop anti-bodies and continue with their lives.

Isolationist tendencies in manufacturing are kicking in as well. Up until now, significant companies organised production using global value chains – that is, relocating production to low wage countries to cut costs. After the economic crisis of 2008/09, global value chain expansion may have come to a halt. However, recent developments revealed many countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. It became painfully apparent with regards to medical protective equipment.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests in 2018 ""China provided 43 per cent of world imports of face shields, protective garments, mouth-nose-protection equipment, gloves, and goggles"".

The same holds true for electronic components, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, metals and other supply components imported from China and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, Mexico and Vietnam.

In the wake of the coronavirus supply chains have been thrown into disarray: logistics became virtually impossible to control, and the prices on specific articles sky-rocketed as components and raw materials became scarce. With the IMF's World Uncertainty Index (WUI) ""three times the size of the uncertainty during the 2002–03 <…> (SARS) epidemic and about 20 times the size during the Ebola outbreak"" many corporations started to consider regionalisation of manufacturing. The US-China trade war has been another factor influencing this decision.

Disruptions introduced by the virus will likely remain a problem even after countries ease lockdowns and restart economic activity, so producing vital goods within national borders will become a priority. This may signal a retreat by global companies in favour of local players. As for export-oriented Asian economies, they may want to turn ""inwards"" catering more to local markets.

Reducing nonessential economic activities and offering added value

The current crisis isn't your ordinary economic crisis. The prescription for solving a regular financial crisis is relatively simple: the government spends and doles out stimulus funding until people start consuming and working again. In the case of the coronavirus crisis, it's health safety first. Therefore, we can't aim at fast economic recovery, as the whole point of quarantine and social distancing is to stop people from going to work and spreading the disease.

The economist James Meadway writes that the correct response to the COVID-19 crisis would not be a massive upscaling of production, but rather a massive scaling back of production.

Being able to reduce output without threatening livelihoods is vital for economies trying to be more resilient to pandemic crises.

This holds true for both the manufacturing and service sectors. Of course, different industries are being affected differently: aviation, tourism, and hospitality are hit the hardest unable to diversify and cope with the lost demand.

Major manufacturing companies, on the other hand – American household goods giant Kimberly-Clark and Coca-Cola with dozens of brand names under the belt, – are limiting the number of products they make, focusing on the ones in highest demand. Scalability, as well as the potential for diversification, will be a bonus: the UK Royal Mint, for instance, started producing medical visors for hospital use, while Dyson and many other manufacturers are producing ventilators or PPE. Being able to provide added value is also important: in the US national fast-food chains like McDonald's and Subway started to offer free delivery, others introduced everyday grocery items along with their menu staples.

Fast technological advances

Robotic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for the success of supply chains as they help reduce the need for humans to work face to face. With changing modes of consumption and interaction, more and more businesses will go ""digital first"".

After the coronavirus has been tamed, many former office workers will continue to work from home, as this model has proved successful and less costly.

Technological and mental barriers that made a presence on-site essential have been overcome – this is, in fact, one of the significant effects the pandemic has had on the work scene.

""I imagine the pandemic will speed up the development of the infrastructure needed to support our online work,"" says Susan Schneider, director of the ""AI, Mind and Society Group"" at The University of Connecticut, adding she's worried that ""…in a post-pandemic world, corporations may make less use of human labour, replacing human workers with automation and AI. Computers and robots don't get sick.""

Whether humans will remain the dominant workforce or not, remote work and learning that require connectivity and access to online resources, the increase in the number of online payments and day-to-day operations will make us even more dependent on tech companies.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, 'telehealth' and new space technologies are gaining momentum, moving from the realm of science fiction into the mainstream.

While some sectors of the economy will never be the same again, new ones will gain popularity and attract investments, among them security services, independent communication systems, and self-sustaining housing solutions.

Stronger government involvement in social and economic life

During the COVID-19 crisis, the role of government has undergone a dramatic change. Nations are looking to their respective governments to mobilise medical resources, implement containment measures and offer financial help. Free market solutions aiming at making a profit rather than catering to the public good aren't much help when millions of people lose their livelihood overnight. The American government is offering small business loans and direct payments to a vast number of people. Apart from that, the Senate promised to pay $50 billion in bailouts to airlines and $130 billion in aid to hospitals. Germany will spend some €40 billion to bolster small businesses, and in Denmark, the government is ready to cover 75-90 percent of salaries if companies do not lay off their employees. But unprecedented help comes with unprecedented control.

Both democratic and authoritarian regimes imposed quarantines, closed borders and implemented a variety of stringent measures. In the streets of China, drones search for people without face masks and chastise them over loudspeakers. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individuals' phone records. The UK's recently passed coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the right to arrest suspected virus carriers and have them tested. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Belgium use data from major telecommunication companies to track people's movement. The list goes on and on.

Shoshana Zuboff, the author of ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" believes a pandemic is a perfect chance for governments to start monitoring their citizens more closely.

Measures that were once viewed as emergency ones may become a permanent rollback of civil rights.

Liberally-minded folks who fear this scenario are particularly concerned that, given the currently prescribed social distancing, activism has been reduced to ""clicktivism"". That means sitting at home on social media feeds and venting online, instead of rallying and being engaged in other forms of political protest.

When it comes to the economy, a certain degree of government intervention may not be such a terrible idea, as argued by free-market zealots. The Spanish flu of 1918 was, after all, a catalyst in the development of public health systems across quite a few countries, as many governments embraced the concept of socialised medicine.

For the last 25-30 years the most developed countries have been cutting down on public health programmes, and the current pandemic will perhaps encourage some to rethink their approach.

Speaking about scenarios global economies might be pressured to follow after the pandemic, analyst Simon Meir uses terms ""State capitalism"" and ""State socialism"". The first model being predominantly concerned with pursuing exchange value, and the second – with protecting life itself rather than protecting markets. The extreme version of the latter would involve nationalisation of healthcare, food and energy production and, perhaps, providing free housing. State capitalism, on the other hand, doesn't allow for extensive state intervention into the economy, apart from short-term loans for saving businesses. The author, however, points out that these models are likely ""to bleed into one another"". And this is what we're currently witnessing, with the pro-market Trump administration openly talking about taking stakes in airlines, oil and defence companies in exchange for grants.

The elite pilots streaking low over New York and Philadelphia on Tuesday posed a striking thank you to front-line workers like Manhattan's Dr. Sarah Vossoughi, a clinical pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia.

""For them to show us that sign of respect and that sign of honor, for them to do that for us, that makes me feel really special, and it makes it worth it,"" Vossoughi said.

What you couldn't see overhead was the highly choreographed work that kept the fighters flying nonstop.

CBS News flew with pilots and airmen from the Air Force's 305th Air Mobility wing out of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey.

The KC-10 Extender, an aerial refueler, one of four on this mission, took off with 300,000 pounds of fuel to help make it possible for the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels to fly Pensacola, Florida, to New York City and back without landing.

""It's a really huge opportunity for us to show our support for healthcare workers,"" Tech Sergeant Bryce Smith said between refueling F-16 fighters on the flight to New York. ""And this flyover is hopefully going to mean a lot for everybody so it's really nice.""

From the cockpit, we talked to the Thunderbirds, like Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell.

When asked what he hoped front-line workers would take away from the display, Caldwell said, ""We want them to know that we're there, that we care, that we're in this together, we know this has been stressful, we know it has been hard, we know that they're struggling.

The games some people have been playing on social media — choosing who they'd want to be quarantined with — have become real life in Belgium.

Under strict lockdown since March 16, including home confinement except for essential journeys, Belgium's controls have been some of the tightest in Europe. But it's worked — after hitting one of the highest death rates in the world, the nation's infection rate and death toll have dropped steadily since a peak in early April.

The decline led Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès to announce this past week that along with letting all stores reopen on May 11, certain social distancing guidelines will be relaxed.

Beginning on Sunday for Mother's Day, Wilmès said, each household will be allowed to host up to four other people, preferably all within the same family, as long as social distancing is maintained. These groups cannot have contact with anyone else. Authorities describe it as kind of a ""contract"" between two households that will serve to limit any potential spread of COVID-19.

Of course, choosing can be a delicate process; no one wants to hurt the feelings of a friend or relative if they don't make the cut.

Seventeen-year-old music student Carla Vandersteen says her friends started texting immediately about getting together. She's made her ""list,"" consisting of the three friends who live closest to her, but still thinks it's smartest not to go out.

""At least [to protect] your parents!"" she urges. She says it would be so hard to see her best friends and not hug them. She fears many young people will now act like restrictions are completely lifted.

Many Belgians have expressed confusion about whether there's any flexibility in the new rules.

As the parents of three young children, Daniel and Marie Bach joke that as a family of five, they're mathematically ruled out of being any other household's significant others.

""I think they mean 'more or less four,'"" Marie suggests with a laugh. ""You can't just abandon your last child — it can't be so.""

While they are looking forward to some company, Daniel acknowledges ""it's a gamble"" for authorities to allow social bubbles to expand. ""A pretty big one, really.""

Then there's the dilemma of Mother's Day: visit with mom on Sunday and have her locked in as one of your ""four,"" or save that spot for someone else?

Veronique Petit says she and her husband will do some creative counting so that their two adult children can visit them and they can still visit their parents.

""It's impossible"" to follow these rules, Petit says in exasperation. ""So we're going to cheat a little. I think all Belgians are going to cheat.""

Police have admitted they won't be able to verify whether visitations are being carried out correctly, but authorities say if infections spike, restrictions will have to be tightened again.",real
166,673,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-china-behavior-in-europe/,2020-05-07,What’s behind China’s new behavior in Europe,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

The ID Now rapid testing system give results in 13 minutes or less — but studies have shown that it delivers false negatives.

The US Food and Drug Administration just alerted consumers to the potential accuracy problems and is working with the company to do more studies.

Abbott has conceded that false negatives can occur, but says the test works well if used with fresh samples on swabs, rather than those dissolved in liquid.



Some staff are still working in the White House during the outbreak, even as many test positive.

Visit Business insider's homepage for more stories.

The White House is testing its staff for coronavirus using a device made by Abbott Laboratories that has been criticized for giving false negatives.

The New York Times reported that the White House is using the ID Now rapid testing system, which can give results in less than 13 minutes.

However, a study released Tuesday by researchers at New York University found that the system missed a third of the positive samples when using nasal swabs in vials, and more than 48% when using dry nasal swabs. The report hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

Another study in late April found that it was showing a false negative in around 15% of cases — a result affirmed by the director of the National Institutes of Health. Around the same time, Abbott said that the tests work properly when swabs are put directly into the device as opposed to dissolved in liquid.

On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration said it's received no less than 15 reports of Abbott's device returning false negatives and is aware of the recent research. Abbott has agreed to run more studies and sent out a letter notifying customers that negative results needed to be confirmed with another test, the FDA said.

Abbott did not return a request for comment, but said on Twitter that the NYU results were not consistent with other studies. It pointed to a report out of Washington state that showed ID NOW picked up on 21 out of 23 coronavirus-positive samples.

""We have many questions for the NYU study authors,"" the company said.

Rolled out across much of the US

These warnings come after the tests have been rolled out across much of the US, and have been distributed by the federal government. The device, which is the size of a toaster, was given emergency authorization by the FDA in March.

The White House has also tested some aides using other methods, which take longer to process, the Times reported.

US President Donald Trump then called the tests ""a whole new ballgame"" and ""highly accurate.""

Some staff are still working in the White House during the outbreak, and at least a dozen people who may work near Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have tested positive for the virus in the past week.

Kevin Hassett, a senior economic adviser to Trump, said on Sunday that working from home would be safer for White House staff.

But he argued that officials are ""willing to take that chance because we love our country."" He also called the West Wing ""relatively cramped.""

The Washington Post reported on Sunday that White House staff are not being given clear instructions whether to work from home or not.

For Americans, the economic impact of the virus has led to new categorizations of ""essential"" workers, a large-scale move to remote work and skyrocketing unemployment that is expected to continue increasing. With more than 30 million people filing for unemployment in the past six weeks, the U.S. is predicted to experience a coronavirus-induced recession through 2021. And amid stay-at-home orders across the country, office workers have ditched their daily commutes to work from dining room tables, couches and beds in their own homes. Many may find themselves in this situation for the long haul, as businesses struggle to find a path forward while restrictions slowly lift. But what other changes will we see in the coming months and years? CNBC Make It spoke to futurists, employment experts, CEOs, designers and more to find out how the pandemic could forever transform the way we work.

Working in an office could become a status symbol

Following the pandemic, it's likely that more Americans will split their time between working from home and from a corporate office, says Brent Capron, the design director of interiors at architecture firm Perkins and Will's New York studio. ""People will still gather for work,"" he says. ""But the amount of time you work in proximity with others, and what your work week looks like — I see that to be the biggest cultural shift moving forward."" With more people working remotely, companies may open regional hubs or provide access to co-working spaces wherever their workers are concentrated rather than have the majority of their workforce at one central office. As a result, corporate headquarters may become a status symbol for the companies that still have the budget and a workforce big enough to warrant pricey real estate in a major city. A company's investment in its headquarters could become a way to recruit talent, says Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit campaign about unemployment, and a former assistant secretary at the Department of Labor. Job seekers may consider it a draw to work for a company with a physical location, which could boost brand awareness and overall influence within the industry.

Most meetings could be replaced by email and IM

Expect your post-pandemic work calendar to contain fewer meetings overall, says Nadjia Yousif, managing director and partner of Boston Consulting Group's London office. The pandemic has been a technological equalizer of sorts, she says, where people previously unaccustomed to using tech tools in the workplace have had no choice but to adapt. And in some cases, workers are becoming more efficient. ""People have been more patient in learning new technologies and engaging with them, simply because they've had to,"" Yousif says. ""I think those best practices will live on. I think we're all developing new muscles to work virtually."" To that end, expect a generally more agile way of working and communicating with colleagues: More meetings will become emails, and more emails will become instant messages. For team members who no longer work together in a central office, phone calls and meetings may move to video. This could help to build trust among workers who can't interact in person, Yousif says. When you're able to pick up on nonverbal cues, or you're invited into a colleague's home via video chat, ""a different type of intimacy is formed in a faster way than would happen in a traditional working environment,"" she says.

It could be the end of business travel as we know it

As travel of all kinds is halted, telecommuting is adopted at scale and companies attempt to cut costs and balance their budgets, many experts believe business trips as we know them will be a thing of the past. ""I don't think [business travel] is ever going to be exactly the same,"" says Gary Leff, a travel industry expert and author of the blog View from the Wing. Changing consumer preferences and greater interest in social distancing will limit large group events such as conferences and conventions for the foreseeable future, says Leff, and permanently decrease the volume of business travel. Additionally, Leff expects that during this time, companies will learn that some business travel is unnecessary and can be done via video meetings. He also points out as organizations attempt to recoup their pandemic-related losses, travel budgets will be cut.

Office buildings could become 'elaborate conference centers'

With the office building recast as the ultimate status symbol, its main purpose could shift. ""Does office space strictly become elaborate conference centers?"" asks Capron. He predicts office buildings of the future may become facilities to gather, while focused work is done remotely. This could mean fewer walled-off offices and more gathering spaces to host meetings, conferences and other company-wide events. Beyond that, the open office floor plan will likely stick around. Despite criticism that they kill productivity, it's likely companies will still use the layout in an effort to lower real estate costs. Open layouts will change, however: Desks could become spaced out, partitions could go up, cleaning stations stocked with hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes will become the norm, and workers may seek out spaces for focused work, such as privacy booths. Capron stops short of saying cubicles will make a comeback. Agile workspaces with unassigned seating will decline in popularity. Workers will want the security and control of having a personal space they come to every day or every few days and can clean frequently. In shared spaces, expect more touchless fixtures, such as door sensors, automatic sinks and soap dispensers and voice-activated elevator banks. Architects may also design spaces with durable building materials, furniture, flooring and other surfaces that can stand up to frequent deep-cleaning, which is expected to be a lasting necessity of the future workplace for years to come.

Mandatory on-the-job medical screening could become the norm

Health and legal experts predict that on-the-job medical screening, such as temperature checks and antibody tests, will be a reality for those who return to work in the months ahead. And in many cases it's already happening: To combat the spread of coronavirus among essential workers, some of the biggest employers in the country, including Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and Starbucks have begun taking the temperatures of their employees before they are allowed to work. According to labor and employment attorney David Barron, not only are employers legally permitted to check employees' temperatures, they are also currently being encouraged to do so by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""As long as employers don't discriminate — they can't pick and choose who is tested — it's absolutely legal."" It's also possible U.S. workers may be asked to show some form of ""immunity certificate,"" verifying that they have immunity to Covid-19, before they return to work, Barron says. This approach, in which workers take an antibody test to confirm that they have immunity, is being embraced in countries such as the United Kingdom, which is attempting to roll out an ""immunity passport"" program. However, some scientists have warned that it is yet to be scientifically proven that having antibodies for coronavirus gives a person immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, has indicated that an ""immunity certificate"" program is ""being discussed."" ""It might actually have some merit under certain circumstances,"" he told CNN.

Coworkers could become even closer

If there's one bright spot to how the pandemic will impact the future of work, it's that it could strengthen the personal relationships we form with colleagues. ""For a long time, we've probably taken for granted the ability to see our coworkers every day and maybe didn't realize how valuable that was,"" says Lakshmi Rengarajan, a workplace connection consultant formerly of WeWork and Match.com. ""I think teams will be a lot closer when they're able to move back into the workplace."" Organizational psychologist, Wharton professor and ""Originals"" author Adam Grant agrees. He predicts that, as coworkers return to the office, they'll ditch previous messaging habits and actually get up, walk around and visit with each other in person. ""There will probably be fewer sad desk lunches,"" he says. Workplace friendships could flourish among colleagues who relied on each other during the pandemic and got to know one another on a more personal level. But despite more in-person interaction among colleagues, handshakes are on their way out. Fauci recently advised that handshaking needs to stop even when the pandemic ends, and other health experts agree. Rengarajan says gestures that can convey friendliness and respect from a distance, such as a nod or smile, could become the social norm. ""Maybe it's the rise of eye contact or listening,"" Rengarajan says. Read more: The pandemic has probably made you more vulnerable with coworkers—here's why that could be a good thing

Fashion-ready face masks could become a wardrobe staple

Though business casual will likely remain the norm in offices, two new types of apparel could also spring from the pandemic: The rise of work-from-home office wear, and face masks as a socially mandated accessory. Workers who video conference frequently may retool their wardrobe to be camera-friendly — more bold colors, large-scale patterns and clean lines; fewer neutrals, small prints and frills. ""If we are going to be mediating our professional lives on screens more, I think people will think more about how they appear on screen,"" says Natalie Nudell, a fashion and textiles historian faculty member at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. Wearing a face mask around the office may become commonplace, especially in bigger companies with more workers sharing tight quarters. This could be an opportunity for the textile industry to innovate how to make masks more protective, comfortable and stylish.

Standard 9-to-5 office hours could become a thing of the past

As professionals juggle the demands of work life and home life all in the same place, many employers have relaxed rules about workers starting and ending their days at a set time. ""I think you'll see a new norm around trust and respect"" in the ways employers manage their staff moving forward, says career coach Julie Kratz. With many employees successfully working from home now, it will be a lot harder for employers to deny flexibility around work hours and work settings, she explains. ""For most office-type work, you can absolutely do your work remotely, and with technology, you can build it around your schedule,"" adds Kratz, who says that many of her clients at tech companies such as Salesforce were already working flexible hours before the Covid-19 outbreak. To maintain a sense of structure, Kratz says employers will have to set expectations for when they need everyone in the office or online for staff meetings and other team activities. Additionally, she says, in order to create a balance between work time and personal time, employees and managers will have to work closely together to ensure that no one is feeling pressured to respond to emails and messages at all hours of the day. ""By all means, it's not about throwing out all the rules,"" she emphasizes, ""but it's about letting people co-create them.""

Home office stipends could become a common perk

When Twitter and e-commerce company Shopify issued mandatory work-from-home orders for employees in March, both employers provided staff with additional resources to help smooth the transition to remote work. At Shopify, workers were given a $1,000 stipend to purchase necessary supplies for their home office spaces. Meanwhile at Twitter, all employees, including hourly workers, received reimbursement for home office equipment including desks, chairs and ergonomic cushions. If working remotely becomes the norm, then home office stipends could become a common workplace perk, says bestselling author and futurist Jacob Morgan. In order for remote work to be effective, employers will have to provide employees with the resources needed to be productive, he explains. This includes a small stipend that will allow workers to ""customize their space in a way they think is sufficient."" This remote flexibility will also allow companies to ""save money on the overhead cost of running these massive facilities,"" career coach Julie Kratz adds. On average, employers that allow employees to work from home part-time save about $11,000 per year for each employee working remotely, according to research-based consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics. Using some of this money to invest in remote office setups ""will buy loyalty from your employees because it shows you care about them, you care about the ergonomics of their situation at home and you want them to be happy and productive,"" Kratz says.

The workplace could become more equitable for women

With many workplaces now being forced to operate remotely, long-term flexibility could be here to stay, allowing more women to remain in the workforce while balancing home and work life, says Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. This change in workplace structure could have a huge impact on women, as they are more likely than men to adjust their careers for family. In fact, roughly 31% of women who took a career break after having kids said they didn't want to but had to because of a lack of employer flexibility, according to a 2019 FlexJobs survey of more than 2,000 women with children under 18. This break, according to PayScale, can easily cost women tens of thousands of dollars when lost wages, future wage growth and lost retirement and Social Security contributions are added up. A more flexible work culture could also create more equity at home as both men and women are able to spend quality time with their families. ""You're going to see more men starting to want these [flexible options] too, assuming they enjoyed the time at home with their kids,"" Kratz says. Though a wider variety of work options won't solve all of our equity issues, other countries show it is possible to create a more gender-balanced culture. ""You can see this in Scandinavian countries, for example; they offer this flexibility,"" Kratz says. ""You see gender equality is much higher in those countries as a result."" Read more: Why long-term flexible work options could be a game changer for women

Middle management positions could be cut forever

In the months and years ahead, we could continue to see a hollowing out of middle management. ""One of the big things that happened during the 2008 global financial crisis is that organizations pulled out all sorts of layers of middle management, which actually makes it harder to get promoted,"" says Brian Kropp, vice president at research firm Gartner. That's one reason wage growth was sluggish, he says, even as the economy reached new heights: Workers were not promoted to middle-management roles as frequently, since so many were eliminated during the recession. It's possible we may see a similar dynamic post-pandemic, says John Sculley, who served as Apple's CEO from 1983 to 1993. ""A lot of organizations are going to say, 'Wait a minute, we don't really need all these layers of middle management that we had in the past,'"" Sculley, currently chairman of pharmacy benefit management company RxAdvance, tells CNBC Make It. Others are more optimistic that the demand for top-tier managers will rebound once the pandemic subsides because organizations will want to emphasize productivity. One fear of a flattening management structure is that fewer managers will be required to oversee a higher volume of direct reports, creating room for error, lack of oversight and mismanagement. ""I personally think good managers are always going to be in demand,"" says Oates. ""You can't have a good workforce unless you have good managers.""

Automation could be accelerated

While futurists have long warned of ""job-stealing robots,"" the coronavirus pandemic has heightened fears that automation will replace the jobs of workers. Because of social distancing measures, many organizations — from restaurants to retailers — have been forced to find ways to operate with as few employees physically present as possible. An added bonus: Robots and algorithms can't get sick. Coronavirus ""has caused an acceleration of some labor trends like automation,"" says Karen Fichuk, CEO of Randstad North America, adding that out-of-work Americans may need to develop new skills in order to find new jobs. ""What we're seeing is this significant need for massive up-skilling and retraining, especially for workers who have been laid off."" Jake Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of General Assembly, agrees that coronavirus will accelerate automation. ""It's pulling the future forward,"" he says. For years, companies have been working toward automating repetitive jobs through algorithms that can complete administrative tasks, robots that can streamline manufacturing and drones that can deliver goods. And researchers have found that this kind of automation is more quickly adopted during economic downturns. ""Companies are going to be going digital much faster, they're going to be automating much faster. And in that context, are we looking at mass unemployment? We don't know,"" says Schwartz.

Los Angeles may find itself in a worse financial situation than envisioned in the mayor’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, city officials said Thursdsay, May 21.

According to Chief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the city’s Office of Finance is anticipating 2021 tax revenues will be a minimum of $45 million short of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s proposed budget and could fall short by as much as $400 million, depending upon how quickly the economy recovers.

“There is no doubt that we are going to be facing a difficult fiscal year,” Council President Nury Martinez said. “But even in difficult years, this council has delivered by focusing on the most vulnerable communities in our city. As we start the new fiscal year, it is important to keep in mind the people who need us the most right now.”

Although Los Angeles has been using financial tactics to pay for essential materials to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the lagging economy may not catch up fast enough before the city is forced to further dip into its reserves.

Councilman Paul Krekorian, the council’s Budget and Finance Committee chair, said that although tax returns for May have not been calculated, the city’s sales tax revenues were down 10% in March and 17% in April compared to last year, and the city’s hotel tax revenues were down 11% in March and 77% in April.

“The fear is that this is only going to get worse from here and that we’re going to be faced with even more difficult choices,” Councilman Bob Blumenfield said.

The budget process for Los Angeles will continue through June, as the city looks for ways to brace for the financial effects of COVID-19.

The Budget and Finance Committee is planning to meet June 8, 15, 22 and 29 to examine the budget, but Krekorian said it’s not possible to examine each department’s finances at great length this year.

“Even if we had considered all of those lengthy hearings that we typically have, the truth is the level of uncertainty over all of the assumptions that we rely on for our budget is greater now than it has ever been, probably in the city’s history,” Krekorian said.

Los Angeles’ entire budget is proposed to be about $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, with an operating general fund of about $6.6 billion.

Los Angeles has already spent $155 million in special fund loans on personal protective equipment and other COVID-19 preventions, but much of those funds could be reimbursed through Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.

Much of the funding for loans is coming from the Department of Building and Safety, and those loans have interest attached to them and must be repaid eventually.

Another $82 million from various funding sources has been used to cover COVID-19 testing kits, senior meals, small business micro loans and other programs.

COVID-19 testing has taken up more than half of those expenses at $43 million, and city officials said they’re trying to have the county take over its testing sites, as it may receive federal funding to do so.

Los Angeles estimates it will receive about $694 million in federal coronavirus relief, but those funds can be used only for responding to the virus and have to be spent by the end of 2020.

The funds cannot be used to replenish revenues the city anticipated it would have received prior to the pandemic.

“We really need to spend those dollars on COVID-specific responses within that time frame,” said Matthew Szabo, Mayor Eric Garcetti’s deputy chief of staff.

But the city has already had to dip into its reserves, which have fallen from a “robust” 8.5% of the general fund, about $407 million, and will likely be down to 3.6%, or $243 million, by the start of the next fiscal year. City Administrative Officer Richard Llewellyn said the reserves are “dangerously low.”

Los Angeles was facing difficult budget decisions prior to the pandemic related to pay raises and contracts with public safety departments, which make up most of the city’s operating budget.

The Los Angeles Police Department’s budget for this year was about $1.73 billion, and next year it is expected to be increase to $1.85 billion.

Public speakers said Wednesday and Thursday they opposed the proposal to increase the LAPD budget, contending that the money should be used for housing and COVID-19 prevention efforts.

Councilman Mike Bonin asked if there was a way to defer pay raises in response to the pandemic. Neither the LAPD nor Los Angeles Fire Department budgets are in line to see decreases compared to this year.

Llewellyn said he did not want to discuss labor negotiations in a public setting, but “everything is on the table.”

Some notable services that are expected to be reduced include capital improvement projects, graffiti abatement, tree services, animal sterilization and the mayor’s Gang Reeducation and Youth Development program.

“Our effort here … was to not cut entirely or eliminate any particular portion of a department or a program, but to try to manage the reductions across the city,” Szabo said.

The city has enacted a hiring freeze, estimated to save $42 million next year, and it plans to furlough 15,000 of its civilian employees for 26 days next year to save $139 million.

Councilman David Ryu said as the city considers the budget, it should not make cuts to services that help homeless people, the elderly, victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations.

“If we make cuts to departments and services that serve low-income and working families, we will be paying for those cuts for decades to come,” Ryu said.",real

Testing. What’s that all about? I understand they scrape inside your nose with a giant swab, then send the tip off to a lab to determine whether you’ve been infected by COVID-19.

But toward what end?

If you’re really sick, doctors need to know if it’s coronavirus to guide treatment. No confusion there. But what’s the goal of testing the general population? To track the pandemic’s spread? Important, but that isn’t why people are jamming National Guard drive-thru locations. Fear? Mere curiosity?

Opinion

The general idea, as best I understand it, is that you may have been infected but had no symptoms — many do not — and once you learn you were already infected but are OK now, then you can breathe a big sigh of relief and go about your business, packing into bars, jamming into church pews, secure in the knowledge you can’t get sick because you already have been.

You’d think that, desperate to get the economy back, both the dithering federal government and people protesting the lockdown would unite in one voice to demand those tests, now.

But they’re not. The federal government hems and haws like Hamlet, then shrugs and tells the states to figure it out — all while Fox News types cram statehouse steps to decry any organized attempt to save their lives as fascism.

Even municipalities are trying to get people tested, as are businesses like Simple Laboratories of Harwood Heights, a relatively new (founded 2014), relatively small (200 employees) diagnostic lab reaching over the paralyzed health care system, directly to the public, sorting out the general confusion as it goes.

“We’re in a world of questions right now,” said Narni Yoder, co-founder and chief sales officer of Simple Laboratories, which began drive-thru testing last week. “It’s not black and white.”

No kidding. Not long ago, Simple Labs was busy doing basic “tried and true” tests — scanning blood samples for venereal disease and hepatitis, diabetes and cancer. And then this plague came, and it began testing for that.

Diagnostic labs setting up white tents in church parking lots is a hint the medical system isn’t working.

“We couldn’t wait any longer,” said Yoder. “We tried to go through the normal channels of our clinics, doctors we work with independently. The majority are closed to patients. Everybody is funneled to emergency rooms. But those turn patients away and tell them to go to doctors. Our normal ways weren’t going to work; we had to find our own options. Three weeks ago, we realized: We can just do it. We need to figure it out.”

A lot of people need to do that. Yoder said her facility could process up to 4,000 tests a day but is doing only about 100.

“Our limitation is collection,” said Yoder, adding they’d like to work with groups, such as nursing homes.

No doubt. And I want to sell more papers. But why are tests important?

“People should know their status,” Yoder said. “People should be able to take care of themselves. If you don’t know, it causes more worry. When you know, you might have a path.”

That seemed awfully general. Most people, I imagine, have not been exposed to COVID-19, so testing does nothing besides put $100 into the pockets of places like Simple Laboratories while the tested person ends up in the exact same position: at home, wiping down cans of soup from Sunset Foods.

Right?

“A couple of ways to think about it,” she said. “One, without testing, we can’t move forward. How do we move everybody forward? We’ve been focusing on first responders. What about the rest of the community? What about everyone else? How do we move everything forward? ... That testing is critical.”

“It’s an important step forward,” said Arlene Jezierny, the mayor of Harwood Heights.

I’m all for moving forward. Yoder wouldn’t reveal what percentage of people they’ve tested had been exposed — trade secret — but I persisted. Most haven’t, right? Right?

“The majority of people were not exposed,” she allowed.

It’s all about moving forward.

“The faster we can test more folks, the more information we can contribute to the community and we’ll be able to bring everybody back to some sense of normalcy,” Yoder said.

What’s that line from the end of “The Sun Also Rises”? Oh yes. “Pretty to think so.”",real

Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.

The first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.

Contact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.

Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked

More:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.

Other tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.

Privacy concerns over tracking

Privacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.

Even the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. ""The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.

ACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. ""Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,"" Singh Guliani said.

She urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.

Utah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.

The state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.

""This is a red state,"" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. ""They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' ""

Wolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.

North Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. ""It was rushed to market,"" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. ""We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.""

Tracking without revealing identity

The ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.

But even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.

Among the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.

Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Salathé said all COVID-19 apps so far are ""fundamentally broken"" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salathé authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.

""You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,"" he said.

Other U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.

Salesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace ""relationships across people, places and events"" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.

""It's only as good as a lot of us using it,"" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. ""If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective."" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.

The ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation.",real

A fear of the unknown. The need to maintain an appropriate distance. An urgent desire to find a cure or vaccine.

They're the hallmarks of the coronavirus pandemic, but they also characterized an earlier epidemic: when paralysis-causing polio ravaged the U.S. in the 1940s and '50s.

Now, the toddlers and preteens of that era are once again part of a high-risk group during a deadly epidemic of a highly infectious disease.

Commonly transmitted person to person, polio led to social distancing even without official enforcement. People avoided public places and those infected were shunned.

Ina Pinkney was a year old when she contracted the disease in Brooklyn, N.Y.

""When my parents would take me out ... you could hear everybody get silent and move away, which is very much what it feels like now,"" says Pinkney, who is 77 now and lives in Chicago, where she ran a successful restaurant for decades.

Much like the coronavirus, when one person contracted polio, the entire family lived in anxiety of household spread. That was the case when Nancy Artinian Theoharis became sick more than six decades ago at age 14.

Her daughter Liz remembers stories about her grandmother's efforts to protect the other children in the house, particularly her aunt, who shared a bedroom with Nancy.

""My grandma would furiously take my aunt's temperature every day,"" Liz Theoharis says. ""While everybody may have been exposed, there was fear that my aunt will come down with the virus as well.""

As news reports of the coronavirus spread in the U.S. worsened, Margaret Nielsen started feeling a sense of deja vu, recalling memories of battling polio as a 4-year-old.

At the time, people stricken with the disease like Nielsen could spend weeks isolated in the hospital.

The 78-year-retired professor remembers how little the doctors knew about the disease, and how hard it was for her family to get updates on how she was doing.

""They could call once a day and they would get a one-word response because there were so many families calling,"" says Nielsen, who lives in East Lansing, Mich. ""So during the initial couple of weeks when I was infectious there was so little information.""

Infectious cases peaked in the 1950s, with nearly 60,000 contracting the disease and more than 3,000 deaths in 1952 alone.

People felt a great sense of urgency about when a vaccine would be found, says Carl Kurlander, whose documentary A Shot Felt 'Round the World chronicled the discovery of the first preventative polio vaccine.

Dr. Jonas Salk began work on a live virus vaccine in 1947. And in 1955, a safe and effective vaccine became available to the public.

""Church bell rang out, people screamed and were let out of school,"" Kurlander says. ""Around the world there were headlines 'Victory Over Polio.'""

Now, riding through another epidemic, Pinkney says that a coronavirus vaccine may not instantly reverse things to normalcy but ""there will be a great sense of relief.""

And surviving that earlier epidemic has given her perspective: ""I live with hope and I live with anticipation that we will [get] on the other side of this. I don't know what it looks like. It doesn't even matter, as long as people are not getting sick and people are not dying.""",real

During most of April, the HR assistant sat on the floor and worked from her personal laptop. But with the COVID-19 shutdown extending into May, she and her boyfriend invested in a more comfortable setup.

They ordered a desk from Wayfair, an office chair from Amazon, ink for the printer and other home office staples. In total, they spent more than $600.

""It all added up quickly,"" Silva said. ""I had no idea it would cost this much.""

Silva is far from the only person scrambling to piece together a home office in the stay-at-home era, and setting one up from scratch isn't cheap.

In fact, most people (54%) didn't have a remote work setup before the government moved to curb nonessential gatherings, according to a survey conducted by YouGov in partnership with USA TODAY and LinkedIn. Meanwhile, 74% of professionals age 18 to 74 said they're now working from home.

While remote work cuts down on the cost of commuting, home offices come with other sets of expenses.

People who are used to endlessly charging their laptops and other devices at the corporate office are now facing higher household electricity bills. Then, there's the expense of office furniture and reliable Wi-Fi. You may even feel pushed to invest in a printer or extra monitors.

But do companies have to reimburse you for any of these?

""It's tricky,"" said Lara Shortz, a labor attorney at Michelman & Robinson. ""But it largely depends on the state you live in.""

Several states such as California, Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota have laws that require some sort of reimbursement for necessary work-related expenses. That means companies are more likely to cover the cost of hardware that you need to fulfill your job, like a computer or laptop, Shortz said.

Upgrades to your home internet typically wouldn't qualify for reimbursement under state laws, Shortz added.

Nearly a third of those working from home (32%) have had their calls or video chats interrupted by Wi-Fi or technology challenges, the study with LinkedIn and YouGov found. Some people are paying for more internet bandwidth to overcome these issues.

Johanna Appel, an elementary school teacher in Long Island, New York, upgraded her home internet plan to accommodate an influx of Zoom calls with dozens of faculty members and students.

Her job provided her with a Chromebook laptop, though it wasn't powerful enough, she said. She spent nearly $2,000 on a Dell HP desktop, a set of headphones and a printer since the school closed its doors in mid-March.

""I had to do it for my sanity,"" Appel said. ""I think the money was worth being spent, but I don't think I'll get reimbursed at all.""

If you use part of your home for business, you may be able to deduct some of the expenses when you file your taxes. The IRS website says the home office deduction is available for both homeowners and renters.

Not everyone can afford a comfy work setup at home. Internet providers like AT&T and Comcast have offered incentives to ease the burden. And not everyone has space to fit a work desk. But experts have tips for using what you do have.

A quality pair of headphones is a simple way to help you focus on your tasks by reducing the noise you hear around you, according to Madeline Pratt, founder of the technology consulting agency Fearless in Training.

""With people having kids, dogs and partners at home, getting a really good headset situation is critical to be clear and focused on calls,"" Pratt said.

You don't necessarily need to buy a desk in order to look professional on Zoom calls, said LinkedIn career expert Blair Heitmann. Just ""avoid couches, beds and cozy chairs that put your posture in a more relaxed position,"" Heitmann said.

These days, coworkers are understanding when it comes to occasional interruptions from kids or pets. Still, finding a dedicated space to work that's free from unnecessary distractions is essential.

""Try to find a place that is set apart from the rest of your family with a door,"" Heitmann said. ""And be sure to communicate with your family when you need some alone time.""

Obama also reacted to the Justice Department dropping its criminal case against Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying he worried that the “basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.”

More than 78,400 people with COVID-19 have died in the United States and more than 1.3 million people have tested positive, according to the latest estimates from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Obama’s comments came during a Friday call with 3,000 members of the Obama Alumni Association, people who served in his administration. Obama urged his supporters to back his former vice president, Joe Biden, who is trying to unseat Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

“What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy — that has become a stronger impulse in American life. And by the way, we’re seeing that internationally as well. It’s part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty,” Obama said, according to Yahoo News.

“It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mindset is operationalized in our government,” he said.

Trump has consistently defended and boasted of his response to the virus, saying that travel restrictions from China and Europe as well as social distancing guidelines have prevented far greater damage. “I think we saved millions of lives,” he said earlier this week.

Trump has criticized the Obama administration in relation to his own administration’s response to the outbreak. Yet Trump’s contention that his administration inherited “a broken system and a broken test” from Obama’s is false; the novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention struggled to develop its own test in January and then discovered problems in its kits in February.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not mention Obama directly in her response to his remarks.

“President Trump’s coronavirus response has been unprecedented and saved American lives,” she said. “While Democrats were pursuing a sham witch hunt against President Trump, President Trump was shutting down travel from China.”

She added: “While Democrats encouraged mass gatherings, President Trump was deploying PPE, ventilators, and testing across the country.”",real

Celebrities, activists, artists and students themselves recognized America's 3 million-plus graduating high school seniors in a widely broadcast ceremony on Saturday night, after the coronavirus crisis robbed the class of 2020 of a crucial milestone.

The virtual event, called Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020, carried a resounding message of community at a time when COVID-19 rules out the possibility of large gatherings.

In his commencement speech, former President Barack Obama told students that they've already faced big challenges to get to this point.

""Graduating is a big achievement under any circumstances. Some of you have had to overcome serious obstacles along the way,"" he said.

And just as seniors were ready to celebrate crossing the finish line, the coronavirus pandemic hit.

Acknowledging the new uncertainties introduced by the pandemic, Obama told the class of 2020 that the global health crisis would force them to grow up faster.

""When everything's up for grabs, this is your generation's world to shape,"" Obama said.

""This pandemic has shaken up the status quo and laid bare a lot of our country's deep-seated problems,"" he said, pointing to economic inequality, systemic racism and health care disparities.

The former president closed with a final piece of advice: Build a community.

""No one does big things by themselves,"" he said. ""If we're going to save the environment and defeat future pandemics, we're going to have to do it together. So be alive to one another's struggles. Stand up for one another's rights. Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us.""

Basketball star LeBron James, whose activism has centered on primary education, flipped the ""stay home"" message spread during the public health crisis into a metaphorical one: ""Stay close to home.""

""Class of 2020, the world has changed. You will determine how we rebuild, and I ask that you make your community your priority,"" James said.

Megan Rapinoe, soccer player for the U.S. Women's National Team, told the seniors, ""I'm not gonna ask you to come together. I'm going to ask you to demand better.""

She encouraged students to vote in November, adding, ""Who is leading matters.""

Education activist Malala Yousafzai is also missing her graduation, after studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University.

She asked viewers to remember the young women in the world who won't be able to return to school because the coronavirus crisis pushed them into forced marriages and low-paying jobs.

""As you go out and change the world, don't leave them behind,"" she said.

The speeches were punctuated by students who thanked teachers, tributes from parents and plenty of TikTok clips.

Musicians stepped in front of green screens that featured videos of seniors dancing and playing instruments. Special appearances were made by Dua Lipa, H.E.R., Zendaya, Shaquille O'Neal, Yara Shahidi, Bad Bunny, Lena Waithe, Pharrell Williams and YBN Cordae.

246,228,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/fda-approves-first-covid-19-antibody-test/,2020-04-03,FDA Approves First COVID-19 Antibody Test,"According to a letter of authorization the FDA has approved the first antibody test in America designed to detect COVID-19; antibody tests can help to identify those who have already had the virus.

Testing thus far has been designed to find fragments of the virus itself, this type of test uses PCR methods to find viral RNA in nasal samples and is useful for detecting those who are currently infected with the virus.

Current diagnostic tests aren’t helpful in identifying those who have recovered from the virus as they will no longer have detectable levels of viral RNA in their body, but recovered patients may have circulating antibodies in their blood. Widespread antibody testing may be useful for determining how many people were infected with the virus but are no longer and may have developed antibodies to help their immunity.

This new test was produced by the biotech Cellex under the emergency use authorization which allows for such testing to be used prior to gaining full approval, provided there are not any previously approved alternatives.

This test requires a blood sample which will be analyzed only in authorized labs, and it takes 15-20 minutes to provide results. It looks for immunoglobulin M and G antibodies; M is the first antibody that the body makes in response to a foreign substance and can appear for a few days after infection. G is produced in large quantities later in the infection process and is specific to COVID-19; positive results from this test could mean that the person is either infected or was recently infected according to the authorization letter.

Other companies were already making and distributing antibody tests without authorization, but those results could not be used to diagnose a past case of infection according to some reports. According to a report in Live Science other countries such as China have been conducting antibody tests for awhile. Blood tests and other tests looking for viral RNA if taken too early might miss cases according to that report.

Though such testing may be useful to determine whether a person has been infected and has developed antibodies, it is still not clear if those who have recovered gain immunity and how long they will remain immune, as some reports suggest that you can become infected more than once. More research is needed to determine immunity of those who have recovered.",fake
264,1694,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-21-restaurants-struggling-where-restrictions-lifted-patrons-staying-home.html,2020-05-21,Restaurants still struggling in areas where restrictions have been lifted as many patrons still voluntarily staying home,"(Natural News) A growing handful of states have begun their reopening phases, in some cases allowing for dine-in patrons at restaurants. But reservations are still down in many areas to such a degree that some restaurant owners are unsure if their businesses will survive.

In Georgia, for instance, which was the first state to end the lockdowns and restart its economy, dine-in business has plummeted to as low as just eight percent of what it was a year prior. And in Texas, which is only allowing restaurants to open at 25 percent capacity, in some cases with airport-style “security” at the door, reservations are consequently down about 83 percent.

The two states receiving the most restaurant business are Alabama and South Carolina, but even these are seeing reservations at barely above 25 percent of normal. This is making it difficult for many restaurants to remain open even if they desperately want to return back to normal.

Because of the way things are opening back up gradually in phases, some experts predict that a shocking one in four restaurants will ultimately go out of business for good. The result will be the further decline of our nation’s economy, which is already on the rocks in many other ways due to the government’s response to the pandemic.

Even in Georgia, strict requirements were put in place to limit the number of customers in restaurants at any given time. Only 10 customers per 500 square feet are permitted, which greatly impedes the ability of restaurants to operate at a feasible capacity to still turn a profit.

Government tyranny is why American restaurants are suffering

Interestingly, polls conducted in states like Alabama and South Carolina show that the vast majority of people are willing to eat out again. The fact that restaurants are continuing to suffer, in other words, has everything to do with government restrictions on how many can eat out at a time.

Data from the National Restaurant Association shows that the restaurant industry as a whole lost an astounding $80 billion in revenue during the months of March and April, mid-March being the time when most states began to shut down in response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

During the month of April alone, the hospitality industry saw a record five million jobs lost, meaning five million people who could have been serving patrons willing to brave the pandemic are now unemployed indefinitely.

But they were still allowed to serve take-out, right? In many cases yes, assuming this was allowed under state and municipal guidelines. The problem, however, is that to successfully run a kitchen it takes a lot of manpower, not to mention enough supplies to make a variety of meals, which many restaurants simply could not provide with very limited service capacity.

Even with the lockdowns being somewhat lifted in many areas it is still not enough for these businesses to survive, let alone thrive.

“Restaurants are complicated beasts,” says OpenTable CEO Steve Hafner. “You have to order food and supplies. You have to make sure you’ve prepped the kitchen and service areas to be easily disinfected.”

Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci, who heads a government agency promoting new “blockbuster” drugs and vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), has stated that he believes the country is moving too fast and that everything should continue to remain closed indefinitely.

“I think we’re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak,” he is quoted as saying.

Last we checked, the goal was never to attain “total control” over this outbreak, but rather to “flatten the curve.” Why have the goal posts suddenly shifted?

Without more funding for states, police officers, teachers, and firefighters will face layoffs, Democrats have warned.

The CARES Act contains another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and would give essential workers a $25,000 pay boost.

Senate Republicans say it's too soon to think about the next relief bill but want to pass liability protections for employers.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

House Democrats on Friday night passed a sweeping, $3 trillion coronavirus rescue package.

The bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, spans 1,815 pages and won't become law. Instead, its passage was meant for Democrats to demonstrate their priorities and signal what they will fight for in a later bipartisan bill that could pass in June.

Senate Republicans told Business Insider they think more time should pass before they take up another relief bill so they can analyze the holes in funding from the other four relief packages they've already passed. President Donald Trump signed a $484 billion coronavirus aid bill in late April. The $2 trillion relief bill, known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, became law in late March.

The HEROES Act won't be taken up for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump has called it ""dead on arrival."" Speaking Thursday night on ""Special Report"" with Fox News' Bret Baier, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House legislation a ""liberal wish list"" that ""strikes me as hardly salvageable.""

Instead of a funding package, McConnell is preparing a bill to shield employers from federal lawsuits if their customers or workers become sick from the coronavirus. While Democrats have said they are concerned about such changes, they might be willing to negotiate a deal to get some of their provisions from the HEROES Act to Trump's desk.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office published a 71-page summary of the bill, which you can read here. Her office didn't work with the White House to craft the bill and instead encouraged members to ""think big"" for the legislation.

""Families know that hunger doesn't take a pause, not having a job doesn't take a pause, not being able to pay the rent doesn't take a pause,"" Pelosi said during her weekly press conference Thursday about the need to pass another relief bill soon. ""The hardship of it all, losing a loved one or having someone in your family sick, it just doesn't take a pause.""

Below are some of the provisions that were included in the bill:

Nearly $1 trillion for states and local governments

The HEROES Act would set aside $500 billion for states, which are losing out on revenue during the coronavirus lockdowns and also expending more money to fight the virus.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously acknowledged the sum was ""an awful lot of money"" but said it was ""essential"" to halt layoffs of police, firefighters, nurses, and teachers. The bill would set aside another $375 billion for cities and other local governments and $20 billion to help territories.

Washington, DC, would receive $755 million. When $150 billion in funds were sent to states under the CARES Act, the capital was treated as a US territory, rather than a state. As a result, it received about $700,000. In contrast, states on average received about $1.2 billion each, Hoyer said.

$25 billion to aid the Postal Service

Democrats want to rescue the US Postal Service with $25 billion in funding. Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who chairs the committee that oversees the Postal Service, said that without the funding, the agency wouldn't be able to survive beyond a few months.

The HEROES Act would provide an extra $15 million for the Office of the Postal Service Inspector General for oversight of the funding.

$175 billion for healthcare providers

Healthcare providers have already received $175 billion through other relief bills but have said the money won't be enough. The HEROES Act would add another $100 billion for hospitals and medical practices. The sum would go toward both recouping money they spent to fight the coronavirus and making up for the dollars they lost from putting off other medical procedures.

The bill would allow $75 billion to go toward testing and tracing people who may have been infected with the virus, adding to the $25 billion already allocated under previous legislation. The Trump administration would need to come up with a national testing plan and put out an awareness campaign on testing.

More money for people, housing, and food stamps

Under the bill, people would get another $1,200 in relief checks for single filers and $2,400 for joint filers, similar to what they got under the CARES Act.

In addition, people who are laid off would get $600 extra in unemployment benefits a week through January 31. The benefits are set to expire on July 31.

Democrats would increase funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps low-income people buy food, by $10 billion.

The bill would also put aside $100 billion to provide emergency assistance to help low-income renters at risk of homelessness avoid eviction because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

Increasing health-insurance coverage

The HEROES Act would set up a special enrollment period for people who don't have health insurance to sign up for private coverage via Healthcare.gov, where millions of people will get government help paying their premiums. People who lost their jobs in recent months are already eligible to sign up for the coverage, but the change from Democrats would allow others who were already uninsured to enroll.

The bill would open a second opportunity for people to get health-insurance coverage by having the government for nine months subsidize the health insurance people used to get through work. Typically, laid-off workers have to pay the full cost for these plans — under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act — on their own, but the HEROES Act would have the government pick up the full cost of premiums.

Letting more people vote by mail

The HEROES Act would provide $3.6 billion for grants to states for contingency planning, preparation, and resilience of elections, according to a document prepared by Democratic staff on the House Appropriations Committee.

The legislation would also have states set up voting by mail in the November elections so that states could either move to only mail voting or make it easier for people to vote through absentee ballots. Democrats have said this setup would help keep people safe if the US is still in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic at that time.

The CARES Act included $400 million for states to shore up their elections, a sum Democrats say is inadequate.

Giving a raise to 'essential workers'

Democrats want to boost pay for people who are unable to do their jobs from home during the pandemic, including healthcare workers, grocery-store workers, and federal employees.

The bill allocates $200 billion for hazard pay and cites the legislation Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put forward in April. It would allow frontline workers to get as much as a $25,000 raise through the end of 2020. The amount is equivalent to giving the workers an additional $13 an hour for continuing to work during the pandemic.

$90 billion to help schools and colleges

The bill would set up $90 billion in grants that states can use to help schools with costs, including the cost of mental-health services, cleaning, buying additional technology, and emergency planning. States could also help colleges recoup money they've lost or help professors learn the new technology they need to use to teach remotely.",real

Variety reports that the film will be available to rent or buy on May 15th, the same day as it was originally due to open in theatres. You’ll be able to rent it for $19.99, or buy it for $24.99, but the Associated Press notes that the film will not immediately be available to stream as part of Warner Bros HBO Max service.

Explaining the decision, Warner Bros CEO Ann Sarnoff said that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has called for “creative thinking and adaptability in how [Warner Bros] distributes [its] content.” Movie theatres have historically fiercely guarded their exclusive release window, which typically lasts for around 12 weeks.

Scoob! is not the only film that’s skipping its cinematic release amid the pandemic. Earlier this month, Trolls World Tour made its debut on video-on-demand services. Its distributor, Universal Pictures, has said that the release was its biggest digital release debut. Other films are following suit. Paramount Pictures has sold romantic comedy The Lovebirds to Netflix, while Disney’s Artemis Fowl adaptation will debut on its streaming service in June.",real

Pan-fried buns with beef filling, shrimp stir-fried with seasonal bamboo shoots, roasted chicken and seared scallops — such dishes are on the menu for the Shanghai medical staff who recently returned from Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of China's COVID-19 outbreak. To show its gratitude for the 1,649 now-quarantined workers, the city has cooked up a free 14-day meal plan for them.

In Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, the city's Federation of Trade Unions is saying ""thank you"" by handing out 2,000 yuan ($280) cash to the families of 122 medics, who will also get paid leave to recuperate after ""winning the battle of epidemic prevention and control.""

Meanwhile, in Guizhou province, residents are wondering: Is a reward still a reward if the heroes have to pay for it?

In the poverty-stricken province, Guizhou Liquor Exchange, a trading platform that promotes liquor trading, investment and storage, took the appreciation game in a questionable direction. It recently offered each of the 1,443 front-line medical workers back from Hubei the opportunity to buy up to six bottles of the nation's most sought-after liquor — a locally produced, 106 proof Maotai liquor called Feitian — at 1,499 yuan ($210) per bottle.

A bottle of Feitian could fetch from 2,000 yuan ($280) to 300,000 yuan ($42,200), depending on the year it was made and market demand.

Produced by the state-owned Kweichow Moutai Group in Guizhou, Maotai liquor is the Chinese answer to premium scotch. Known as China's national liquor, it's often served on official occasions and holiday dinner tables. In 1972, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai made a Maotai toast to then-President Richard Nixon, who was warned prior to the banquet not to drink it. (He did anyway.)

Although the Group sold 142,000 tons of liquor worth more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in 2019, it's not enough for those thirsty for Maotai. Fake Maotai liquors are all over the market, retailing at similar price points. Some fans make pilgrimages to Maotai town, where each visitor is allowed to buy two bottles. On the Chinese e-commerce site Tmall, Feitian liquor is available each day, with a limit of two bottles per 180 days. It's snapped up in seconds.

While $2,106 for six might be a steal, consider the per capita disposable income of an urban resident in Guizhou: 20,397 yuan ($2,870) in 2019. That's one reason the offer has been derided as a crass publicity stunt.

""They [Guizhou Liquor Exchange] are shameless,"" said a commenter on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ""It's just a couple bottles of liquor. Can't they just give for free?""

""This is how you treat our heroes?"" another opined.

""Do you think regular medical workers can afford it?"" one asked.

Others think it's a good deal, especially given the resale market.

""Do you not know how expensive Maotai liquor is? Isn't this a reward?"" one netizen asked.

""I think it's pretty good,"" another said. ""They can make money by reselling these liquors.""

As criticism became increasingly heated, the Guizhou government stepped in, asking Guizhou Liquor Exchange to immediately stop using the pandemic for marketing purposes.

The Exchange has not yet commented.",real

293,1989,https://theduran.com/globalists-in-panic-george-soros-warns-eu-may-not-survive-coronavirus-crisis/,2020-05-24,Globalists in Panic: George Soros Warns EU May not Survive Coronavirus Crisis,"The coronavirus crisis is affecting the European Union on multiple levels. The union is in complete disarray economically, socially, and politically. As the block plunges into recession, anti-EU and anti-Euro sentiment is continuing to grow rapidly.

The ground zero for this sentiment is Italy. For almost a decade, Italy has been on the edge of facing a similar crisis to that of Greece. This has mainly been due to the large deficits produced by the right-wing Berlusconi governments. Since 2018, anti-establishment and anti-EU sentiment in Italy continues to grow, with anti-EU populists now making up a majority of the Italian parliament. Berlusconi’s party is now polling at 6%, while former centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s party continues to barely make the polling threshold needed to enter parliament. When the coronavirus crisis hit, right-wing populists such as Matteo Salvini and Georgia Meloni viciously went after the Euro, pushing for a return to an Italian currency to better handle the crisis. They also criticized the European Union as a whole for its late response to the coronavirus in Italy, which forced the government to turn to aid from Russia.

Their push seems to be working. According to a poll published by Tecne, 47% of Italians support leaving the Eurozone and 46% support leaving the European Union altogether. To compare, only 41% of those polled supported remaining in the union.

Italy, however, isn’t the only nation in Europe where Europskepticism is on the rise. A recent poll suggests nearly 60% of France has no trust in Brussels, up 10 points since the election of Emanuel Macron. This comes as Macron faces increased pressure to resign, this time coming from the left as 10 of his party’s MPs have switched parties. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, often dubbed as a “puppet of the big banks”, has slowly been losing control of his country. As the Yellow Vest protests are starting to revive, the president is also being faced by migrant riots. Time will tell how long Macron can hold on. Recent polling suggests that he could be ousted in the next election by the far-right Marine le Pen.

As the union struggles to hold on economically, the idea of issuing Eurobonds is being seen as an option to satisfy Italy. That option, however, may be off the table as a German court recently declared it unconstitutional. Merkel has since announced she opposes the plan.

George Soros has came out in support for the Eurobond program: “A 1 trillion-euro bond would cost 5 billion euros a year, assuming an interest rate of 0.5%. The consols would not need to be sold all at once; they could be issued in tranches and they would be snatched up by long-term investors like life insurance companies.” The move would add $1 trillion of debt to the European Union as a whole, as if Europe didn’t have enough debt.

Along with Soros, Macron has announced his support for the plan. Unlike Merkel, who at times will turn on the World Order in favor of the interests of her own nation, Macron almost always carries out the interests of those who put him in power. Despite support from Macron, the move seems more and more unlikely as Merkel has not backed down in her opposition to the plan.

Will economic troubles lead to a collapse in the union? George Soros seems to think so. “If the EU is unable to consider it now [Eurobonds], it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts… This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.”

With globalist leaders such as Macron and Italian Prime Minister Conte on the edge of losing power to the far-right, economic troubles for the block may trigger the collapse of both the European Union along with the establishment governments within the block. Time will tell. However, since one of the main architects of the union already echos this sentiment, we may already know the answer.

WASHINGTON — The 2020 election is setting up a legal battle of historic proportions over voting rights, said the top Democratic attorney in the thick of the fight.

“There’s been more voting rights litigation this election cycle already than there was in all of 2016, by a lot,” said Marc Elias, a D.C.-based lawyer with a long history in the political trenches.

“There may be more voting rights litigation in 2020 already than there was in 2016 and 2012 combined. It is on an order of magnitude,” Elias said in an interview on “The Long Game,” a Yahoo News podcast. And the situation is being exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak, which could require an unprecedented increase in mail-in voting this November.

Elias, who was the top campaign lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, said he currently has 32 active lawsuits in 16 states, with about three-quarters of those suits having been filed since last November.

Republicans are not sitting idly by either. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have budgeted $20 million for court fights over voting rights.

“Marc Elias isn’t some knight fighting for voting rights. He’s trying to maximize Democrat votes, and that means opening up our elections to opportunities for fraud,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump’s reelection campaign, told Yahoo News.

Trump talks often about voter fraud, despite the lack of documented evidence of significant voter fraud in modern elections.

“Fraud by voters at the polls is vanishingly rare and does not happen on a scale even close to that necessary to ‘rig’ an election,” according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan voting rights group at New York University.

Elias said a massive legal brawl in 2020 has been brewing for several years thanks to three factors.

First, the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby vs. Holder found that states no longer needed to seek Justice Department approval for major changes to voting procedures. The 1965 Voting Rights Act had instituted “pre-clearance” for a number of Southern states with a history of race-based voting discrimination.

Marc Elias. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: David Jolkovski for The Washington Post via Getty Images, AP) More

But Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby that pre-clearance was based on outdated criteria, and that if Congress wanted to reinstitute it, lawmakers “must identify those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions.”

The Shelby decision, Elias said, “sent a broader cultural signal to Republican legislatures to pass more restrictive voting rules.” That development was a big reason why 2020 was already full of legal battles over voting laws before the coronavirus emerged.

After Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 election, they spent much of 2019 holding hearings in a special committee to establish a record of “current conditions” that they said constituted modern-day voter suppression, usually in states controlled by Republicans, and against minority voters who tend to overwhelmingly support Democrats.

Second, in 2018, restrictions were lifted that had for 35 years prevented the RNC from implementing “ballot security” measures. Questionable tactics by the RNC toward minority voters sustained the limitations for many years, but a federal judge allowed them to expire. Now the RNC has said it plans to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers to look for voters they deem to be suspicious at polling places in the fall elections, and to challenge ballots if need be.

Third, Elias said that Trump’s rhetoric has made Republicans “much more comfortable being in a position of opposing voting rights.”

Coronavirus, Elias said, is “adding gasoline on top of a fire.”",real

New research has now emerged that might soon become a further target for Donald Trump's ire.

A new observational study conducted among more than 96,000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus and treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concluded that the usage of these drugs was associated with a higher risk of death or development of hearth arrhythmias among recipients, according to the medical journal The Lancet that published the research.

“We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19”, the study’s authors wrote. “Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19”.

The observed patients, hospitalised between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020, were recruited from 671 hospitals in six continents and divided into five groups: those who did not receive any treatment by these drugs (control group), those who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine alone, and those who received any of these drugs in combination with macrolide (antibiotic).

The researchers found that the mortality rate was the highest among those 6,221 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%), while the treatment of coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine alone in a group comprising 3,016 patients resulted in an 18% death rate. Those 8% of patients combining HCQ with antibiotics were also more likely to develop a heart arrhythmia, the study argues.

Meanwhile, around 1 in 6 patients treated with chloroquine (16.4%) and 22.2% of those who combined it with an antibiotic died during the study.

In comparison, only 1 in 11 hospitalised patients from the control group fell victim to coronavirus during this period. However, to be fair, the control group was the largest one observed in the study, covering more than 80,000 patients, around 7,546 of whom died.

These results prompted scientists to conclude that the treatment of coronavirus with HCQ was not really beneficial.

“Previous small-scale studies have failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit and larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed”, said the study’s co-author, Dr. Frank Ruschitzka, as cited by CNN. “However, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in COVID-19 is quite low”.

This research was published shortly after US President Donald Trump revealed this week that he was taking HCQ as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the risks of doing so outside of a hospital setting and without proper vetting from health authorities. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used in America for the treatment of malaria, lupus and some other diseases upon prescription for more than six decades, however its utility for the treatment of coronavirus is at best unproven.

“That was a false study done. Where they gave it to very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration”, Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

Published on Wednesday, the analysis — released by Environmental Entrepreneurs, the American Council on Renewable Energy, E4TheFuture, and BW Research Partnership — paints a stark picture for the industry and reflects the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic is having on the overall U.S. economy.

Clean energy job losses in April were far greater than March, when 147,139 claims were made. Total claims for March and April amount to 594,347, or 17.8% of the sector's workforce.

For the purposes of the analysis, the term ""clean energy"" encompasses a range of areas: energy efficiency; renewables; grid and storage; and ""clean"" vehicles and fuels.

Overall, April saw a little over 310,000 people working in energy efficiency file for unemployment, while there were 71,835 job losses in renewables. California was the worst hit state, losing 77,860 clean energy jobs last month.

Looking ahead, the report forecasts more job losses unless the U.S. administration and Congress ""take quick and substantive action to support the clean energy industry and its workers.""

If no action is taken, it's projected that 850,000 people in the sector will have filed for unemployment by June 30.

""The economic data from April shows that the job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic are worse than expected,"" Phil Jordan, vice president and principal at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement.



""Unemployment claims increased dramatically across many key segments of the clean energy sector, such as construction and manufacturing,"" Jordan added. ""And the data does not suggest that we have yet to hit the bottom.""

Around the world, firms working in sectors such as renewable energy are having to adapt to the new challenges posed by Covid-19.

Last week, Nordex became the latest wind turbine manufacturer to withdraw guidance for the 2020 financial year.

In April, Danish business Vestas suspended guidance for 2020, with the Aarhus-headquartered firm noting that the global spread of Covid-19 and national measures taken to contain it had caused disruptions to installations, manufacturing and its supply chain.",real

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “urgency.” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to act.

The so-called Heroes Act is built around nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs, focused chiefly on $375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier rounds of aid.

It will offer a fresh round of $1,200 direct cash aid to individuals, increased to up to $6,000 per household, and launches a $175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages. There is $75 billion more for virus testing.

It would continue, through January, the $600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits. It adds a 15% increase for food stamps and new help for paying employer-backed health coverage. For businesses, there’s an employee retention tax credit.

There’s $200 billion in “hazard pay” for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the bill “will be ready” to call lawmakers back to Washington for the vote.

But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock. Senate Republicans are not planning to vote on any new relief until June, after a Memorial Day recess.

President Donald Trump has already signed into law nearly $3 trillion in aid approved by Congress.

The new package extends some provisions from previous aid packages, and adds new ones.

There are other new resources, including $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service. There is help for the 2020 Census and the November election. The bill also provides $3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of holding elections during the pandemic.

The popular Payroll Protection Program, which has been boosted in past bills, would see another $10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program.

For hospitals and other health care providers, there’s another $100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low-income communities.

There’s another $600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons, along with $600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment

As states weigh the health risks of re-opening, McConnell said the nation needs to “regroup and find a more sustainable middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy.”

The Republican leader on Tuesday called the emerging Democratic bill a “big laundry list of pet priorities.”

“To those who would suggest a pause, I would say the hunger doesn’t take a pause, the rent doesn’t take a pause,” Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC. “We have a big need. It’s monumental.”

But Senate Republicans are in no rush to spend what could be trillions more on aid.

“I don’t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately,” McConnell told reporters Monday at the Capitol.

McConnell said he has been in close contact with the White House, assessing the aid Congress has already approved in response to the virus outbreak and next steps.

Trump is expected to meet Tuesday with a group of Senate Republicans. “If we decide to go forward, we’ll go forward together,” McConnell said. His priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening.

Senate Republicans are not expected to act on any further aid until after the Memorial Day recess, according to a senior Republican aide unauthorized to discuss the planning and granted anonymity.

The Senate is set to recess at the end of next week for a previously scheduled break, with senators scheduled to return June 1.

The Senate recently reopened its side of the Capitol while the House remains largely shuttered due the the health concerns.

Senators have been in session since last week, voting on Trump’s nominees for judicial and executive branch positions and other issues. The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.

At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that if Trump and congressional Republicans “slow walk” more aid they will be repeating President Herbert Hoover’s “tepid” response to the Great Depression.

7:20 p.m. Obama criticizes U.S. leaders’ virus response in online graduation speech

WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized U.S. leaders overseeing the nation’s response to the coronavirus, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

5:55 p.m. Bittersweet e-ceremony for UIC grad: ‘I didn’t really get to say goodbye’

Edith Mendez watched a slideshow of photos from her college experience, read a Spanish quote she handpicked to thank her family and listened to a speech delivered by her college dean Saturday.

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

4:38 p.m. ‘Steady decrease’ in coronavirus cases at Cook County Jail, officials say

Fewer people have tested positive for the coronavirus over the past month at Cook County Jail, officials announced Friday.

The rate of positive COVID-19 tests has gone from 97% to less than 10% since March, Cook County Health officials said in a statement.

Since May 8, most of the new cases have come from detainees entering the jail, rather than people who were already in custody, officials said.

They credited the decline to interventions implemented since the beginning of the year, including opening unused divisions to accommodate social distancing, converting available cells to single-occupancy and enhanced testing.

2:45 p.m. Reopen Illinois rallies draw hundreds to Thompson Center, State Capitol

State health officials on Saturday announced the latest 74 deaths attributed to the coronavirus as several hundred protesters rallied in Chicago and Springfield, calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to roll back his executive stay-at-home order.

The Illinois Department of Public Health also said an additional 2,088 people have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the statewide case tally to 92,457. The death toll stands at 4,129.

And for the third straight day, the Northeast region of the state met the medical criteria set by Pritzker’s administration to advance to the third phase of his reopening plan when his stay-at-home expires at the end of the month. That would mean many non-essential businesses including salons and barbershops could reopen with health precautions in place.

Those Phase 3 reopening requirements include holding the coronavirus testing positivity rate under 20% for two weeks. The Northeast region, which includes Chicago and the collar counties, was at 18.8% Saturday.

But even as plans are laid to gear the economy into motion, the governor’s office has said the peak of the pandemic could extend well into the summer.

The virus has been confirmed in all but one Illinois county, while Cook County is registering the most confirmed cases of any county in the nation. More than 1,800 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the state this month alone.

Despite the grim figures, a vocal contingent of demonstrators rallied again outside the Thompson Center in the Loop and the State Capitol Building in Springfield demanding Pritzker reopen the state immediately.

2:09 p.m. Nurse says she regrets going to packed Wisconsin bar without mask

A nurse says she regrets not taking better safety precautions after she was criticized this week for appearing without a mask in a local television interview at a packed Wisconsin bar.

Katie Koutsky, a nurse with the Downers Grove-based Advocate Aurora Health system, says she was helping her sister reopen her suburban Milwaukee bar Wednesday evening when the news crew approached her.

“I have a toddler at home and I’m a full-time nurse, so it’s been very stressful and hard to not be able to go out and be with my friends and family at the bars,” Koutsky said in an interview aired by Milwaukee station WTMJ-TV.

Asked if she was worried about getting the virus from being in a bar without social distancing, she said, “No, I don’t think that the risk presents any higher than me going to a grocery store.”

11:43 a.m. Coronavirus masks a boon for crooks who hide their faces

The way the FBI tells it, William Rosario Lopez put on a surgical mask and walked into the Connecticut convenience store looking to the world like a typical pandemic-era shopper as he picked up plastic wrap, fruit snacks and a few other items. Then, when the only other customer left, he went to the counter, pulled out a small pistol, pointed it at the clerk and demanded that he open the cash register.

The scene, the FBI contends in a court document, was repeated by Lopez in four other gas station stores over eight days before his April 9 arrest. It underscores a troubling new reality for law enforcement: Masks that have made criminals stand apart long before bandanna-wearing robbers knocked over stagecoaches in the Old West and ski-masked bandits held up banks now allow them to blend in like concerned accountants, nurses and store clerks trying to avoid a deadly virus.

“Criminals, they’re smart and this is a perfect opportunity for them to conceal themselves and blend right in,” said Richard Bell, police chief in the tiny Pennsylvania community of Frackville. He said he knows of seven recent armed robberies in the region where every suspect wore a mask.

Across the United States, masks have become more and more prevalent, first as a voluntary precaution and then as a requirement imposed by governmental agencies and businesses. And people with masks — as well as latex gloves — have found their way into more and more crime reports.

Just how many criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic to commit crimes is impossible to estimate, but law enforcement officials have no doubt the numbers are climbing.

11:17 a.m. ‘Everyone has a story’: How will world remember pandemic?

Artist Obi Uwakwe was driving through Chicago’s empty streets, camera on his lap to document life during COVID-19, when he saw something that made him stop: a casket being carried out of a church while a few mourners stood by, their faces covered.

The 43-year-old raised his camera and took a photograph. Later, it would become one of the images Uwakwe used to create paintings inspired by the pandemic.

“To see maybe six people there, everyone wearing a mask,” he said, “it brought everything together.”

Around the world, people like Uwakwe are creating photographs, paintings, emails, journals and social media posts that will shape how the world remembers the coronavirus pandemic for years and centuries to come. Museums and historical societies already are collecting materials, often with help from people accustomed to capturing and sharing even the most mundane moments around them.

The result, historians say, will be a collective memory more personal than perhaps any other moment in history.

10:46 a.m. Democrats push new $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through House

Democrats powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House on Friday, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.

The 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

10:00 a.m. Illinois nears 2,000 nursing home deaths as coronavirus continues to spread

Illinois is nearing 2,000 coronavirus deaths at long-term care facilities as new, confirmed cases continue to roll in at hundreds of nursing homes impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

State totals now stand at 1,975 deaths and 13,218 confirmed cases in nursing homes, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Long-term care facilities account for 48.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Illinois, records show.

The state’s long-term care facilities reported 455 new deaths and 2,405 new cases this week, according to data released Friday by state health officials.

New deaths were reported at 180 facilities this week, and 259 homes said they had at least one new confirmed case.

A total of 86 homes have seen double-digit deaths tallies, up from 50 last week. There are now 27 facilities reporting at least 100 confirmed cases.

9:04 a.m. Last fans standing: Recounting the Sharks-Blackhawks game on March 11, the last game in town before sports shut down

Brandon Saad cut to the front of the net, took a pass and scored through Aaron Dell’s legs in the second period to give the Blackhawks a 3-1 lead over the Sharks.

It was 8:34 p.m. on March 11.

He celebrated in characteristic fashion, with a yell and double fist-pump, as “Chelsea Dagger” blared.

He had no way of knowing — Hawks teammates would say later they didn’t receive any outside information at either intermission — that the world in which he scored his 21st goal of the season was quickly looking a lot different than the world in which he scored his first 20.

Unlike other disasters of this generation, the coronavirus pandemic did not arrive in an instant. John Lennon’s 1980 death stunned a live television audience on ABC’s “Monday Night Football”; Osama Bin Laden’s 2011 death earned an announcement during an MLB game on ESPN. The emergence of COVID-19 was not nearly as sudden or surprising in any given moment.

But if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.

In a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player — Jazz center Rudy Gobert — testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.

President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.

And during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.

We take a look back — through the eye of fans — at the last major sports event in Chicago.

7:00 a.m. DePaul, Loyola releases plans for fall semester

As coronavirus cases continue to increase statewide, two Chicago universities are planning to have students on campus this fall.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.

DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.

Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.

Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.

“As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”

12:33 p.m. COVID-19 scales back youth sports. That’s a win for many kids

My heart will break for older teens if they don’t get to play sports in Illinois this summer, or maybe this fall, because of the coronavirus. Most are nearing the end of their competitive sports days, and you hate to see them robbed.

For younger kids, I see a silver lining. It’s a chance for them to do more bike riding. They can learn to rollerblade or skateboard. Maybe they can join their parents for runs or walks.

They could get a much-needed break from an over-scheduled life, especially when it comes to sports.

Or, maybe not. In Missouri, a 40-team youth baseball tournament was held last weekend by GameTime Tournaments. You won’t see this in Illinois right now because of the stay-at-home order to curb the spread of the virus. But, at least one Illinois team, the Black Sox from central Illinois, made the trip, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

GameTime instituted social distancing guidelines, including no high-fives, and sanitized the ball often. But some things can’t be helped in baseball: The catcher always will be positioned behind the batter. Players bump into each other on some plays. Out of habit, coaches are bound to get close to players to give instruction.

After being at home for weeks, the games had to be a relief for the players and parents who watched. But 40 teams? That’s downright irresponsible, even if permissible by Missouri’s looser restrictions related to the virus.

Fewer games, or no games for a year, could be a very good thing for kids.

7:00 a.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation

Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.

For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.

A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.

Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.

We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.

So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?

LONDON — A series of studies of the genomes of thousands of samples of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 show that it is mutating and evolving as it adapts to its human hosts.
Here's what experts are saying about those findings and how they might affect the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to develop vaccines and treatments.
WHAT HAVE THE STUDIES FOUND?* Using a database called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States tracked genetic changes, or mutations, in the ""spike"" of the new coronavirus - the part that gives it its distinctive shape.
Their preliminary research found 14 such mutations. The researchers said one, called D614G, was ""of urgent concern"" because it appeared to be emerging as dominant and may make the disease more infectious.
* Using the same GISAID database, a team at University College London in Britain screened the genomes of more than 7,500 viruses from infected patients around the world.
The UCL team found 198 mutations in the coronavirus genomes they analysed but said none appear at this stage to be particularly worrying.
* Another study by scientists at Britain's Glasgow University, which also analysed mutations in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples, found that these changes did not signal that there are different strains.
That contradicted a previous preliminary study by Chinese researchers that suggested there had been two strains circulating in people at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and that one had been more ""aggressive"".
WHAT DO THOSE FINDINGS TELL US?""This multiple strains idea has to be very much debunked,"" said Eric Topol, a cardiologist, geneticist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
""We know there is only one strain.""Jonathan Stoye, head of the division of virology at Britain's Francis Crick Institute, said that taken together, the studies offer ""fascinating"" insights in the evolution of the virus, and emphasise that it is ""a moving target"".
""The virus is evolving and is changing. And we don't yet know what the consequences of those changes are,"" Stoye said.
""This coronavirus mutates just like any good RNA virus should,"" said Mark Schleiss, a molecular genetics expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School.
IS SARS-CoV-2 GETTING MORE DANGEROUS?Genetics and biology experts say it's still too early to know whether any of the mutations are meaningful.
Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain's University of Warwick, said that while there is ""much speculation about the possible emergence of more aggressive strains"", studies so far show that is not the case.
""Overall the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not mutate at a high rate... and there is currently no compelling evidence that the mutations have had a significant effect,"" he said
Topol said scientists will have to conduct studies in functional genomics - examining precisely how a specific genetic mutation affects the behaviour of a virus - to find out more.
WILL THIS AFFECT THE SEARCH FOR VACCINES AND DRUGS?The mutations found by the UCL were not evenly distributed across the virus genome, with some parts of the genome less likely to mutate, and others more likely to vary.
Lucy van Dorp, who co-led the UCL work, said those more stable parts of the virus could be better targets for drug and vaccine development. ""We want to target the parts of the virus that, as far as we have observed, aren't changing. If they haven't changed much in the course of the pandemic so far, hopefully they won't change much in the future.""

Updated at 12:54 a.m. ET

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House agreed Friday on relief legislation in response to the national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.

The House passed the measure by an overwhelming vote Friday night.

The breakthrough followed hours of negotiations between the speaker and the administration, including more than a dozen phone calls on Friday between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the priorities for the package.

President Trump was reticent about the deal until the last moment, but he intends to sign the legislation when it reaches him, according to a source familiar with the White House's plans.

The president also wrote on Twitter on Friday evening that he encouraged Republicans and Democrats to join together in supporting the bill.

Pelosi told Democratic colleagues in a letter earlier on Friday evening that the agreement she'd struck with the administration responded to what she called her top priority: ""testing, testing testing.""

""To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured,"" the speaker wrote. ""We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.""

Pelosi also told Democrats that the legislation would approve paid emergency leave; ""enhanced unemployment insurance;"" more food aid; and increased federal funds for health care.

She and House Democratic leaders had hoped to fast-track legislation they unveiled earlier this week but so far discussions with Republicans about possible changes hadn't gone smoothly enough to permit that.

National emergency

Trump declared a national emergency related to the pandemic in a press conference on Friday afternoon at the White House.

The president said then in response to a reporter's question that he thought Democrats needed to yield more ground in their negotiations over the relief legislation, although he didn't go into detail.

""We just don't think they're giving enough,"" Trump said. ""We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country.""

Separately, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., sent a letter to House Democrats Friday afternoon noting that the speaker has ""literally been working around the clock"" on a deal.

But he said if one was not reached ""we will vote today on our bill, which incorporates nearly all of what the administration and Republicans have requested.""

Opposition to ""bloat""

Several Hill Republicans said they were worried that the latest version of the bill was ""bloated"" and were unwilling to make a final call on their support until the text is released.

There also were concerns among some GOP lawmakers that President Trump has not explicitly embraced the legislation, potentially leaving Republicans open to attacks if they voted for something Trump did not support.

The particulars in dispute included the economic aspects of any relief bill, including the prospect for emergency payroll tax cuts. President Trump wanted them; Democrats and a few Republicans didn't agree.

The president also faulted Pelosi and Democrats on Thursday for wanting ""goodies"" in coronavirus legislation that he said had ""nothing to do with what we're talking about."" Those details weren't exactly clear.

Also unclear on Friday is the legislation's fate in the Senate.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cancelled a recess planned for next week meaning that members would be in Washington to be able to vote — but it wasn't immediately clear how he and members might respond to the deal concluded between Pelosi and Mnuchin.

Five people were killed in a fire that sparked in the intensive care unit at St. George’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, which was earlier redesigned to treat patients with coronavirus.

The fire occurred on the sixth floor in the intensive care unit, the fire affected an area of ââten square meters.

All the killed patients were connected to ventilators. Four of them died as a result of carbon monoxide exposure, another one died when the ventilator, to which the patient was connected, was turned off. According to preliminary reports, the fire started due to the hazardous overload of the ventilator.

""The ventilators are operating to the maximum. It is believed that the equipment was overloaded, and the apparatus caught fire,"" officials said.

Reportedly, there were 16 patients in the department at the moment of the accident. Hospital personnel managed to move eleven of them to another wing of the building. In total, as many as 150 people were evacuated from the building; the fire was localized. All the patients and personnel, who were staying in the intensive care unit during the fire, were transferred to the first floor of the hospital.

The Investigative Committee opened a criminal case under Part 3 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ""Causing death by negligence."" Prosecutors currently look into compliance with fire safety requirements at the hospital.

On the evening of May 9, a fire occurred in the building of the Moscow hospital No. 50 named after Spasokukotsky, where patients with coronavirus are also admitted. The fire broke out in the intensive care unit and began to spread along the first floor, having killed one woman patient with COVID-19. Three others were injured.

Within 30 minutes, all 295 patients were evacuated. It is believed that the fire started because of defective ventilators too.

According to law enforcement agencies, the ventilators that caused the fires at hospitals in Moscow and St. Petersburg were manufactured at one factory - the Ural Instrument-Making Plant. The ventilator at the fire-affected hospital in St. Petersburg was installed there on May 3.

According to preliminary reports, the fire at the Moscow hospital occurred as a result of short circuit, which caused oxygen to catch fire. Other versions include short circuit, malfunction, overload and improper operation.",fake

On Wednesday, Latinos became the first racial or ethnic group in Chicago to record more than 10,000 cases of the coronavirus, according to data released by the city. Latinos now account for 42% of all COVID-19 cases despite making up around 30% of the population.

Lightfoot acknowledged shortcomings in the city’s efforts to reach Latinos early on in the pandemic, particularly residents who are primarily Spanish speakers.

Part of the problem, Lightfoot said, was the lack of testing sites in Latino neighborhoods.

“Early on, we were worried that there was a significant undercount among [Latinos] .... we were not getting enough demographic data from the providers doing testing so that we could fully measure the impact this virus,” she said.

Now that testing has ramped up and a clearer picture has emerged, Lightfoot said her administration is laser-focused on curbing the spread of the virus in neighborhoods that have recorded the biggest spikes like Little Village, Belmont Cragin and Archer Heights.

Crucial to curbing the spread of the virus in those areas are community health centers, Lightfoot said, which predominantly serve black and Latino Chicagoans and are open to everyone regardless of whether they health insurance, including undocumented immigrants.

Lightfoot called on those community health centers to refer patients to hotels the city has contracted to quarantine if they test positive for COVID-19, especially if they live in crowded, multigenerational households and can’t isolate.

“Early on in our response to this virus, we set up hotels that were specifically designated for quarantining and isolation, and so we need to do a better job of communicating the availability of those resources in the Latinx community, and that’s where [community health centers] play a very important role,” Lightfoot said.

The city will also rely upon community groups who provide resources and know-your-rights trainings to immigrants, Lightfoot said, “and we are tapping into that network to help us both educate and understand the day-to-day lived experiences [of Latinos.]”

Lightfoot said social distancing and working from home are “luxuries” that many Latinos can’t afford and promised to make workplaces as safe as possible during the pandemic.

“The biggest issue we have,” said Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd), whose ward encompasses Little Village, “is that a lot residents who are deemed to work ‘essential’ jobs in industries where the proximity of workers lead to higher rates of the virus.”

Jorge Mujica, a labor organizer with Arise Chicago who listened in to the town hall Wednesday, said Lightfoot should send police officers to inspect work sites to ensure physical distancing measures are being implemented.

“It’s pointless to keep telling the community to stay at home if they’re being infected at work,” he said. “The mayor sent the cops over to the lakefront and to the 606 Trail, but she should really send to them factories to inspect whether or not workers are being protected.”

326,360,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html,2020-04-17,Why We Don’t Know the True Death Rate for Covid-19,"
Coroners in some parts of the country are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in coronavirus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new coronavirus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed plenty dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died, recent data shows.
These supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography: Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly one-tenth of Italy’s, and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan, at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at about 0.7 percent.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others, raising the question of why there appears to be so much variance from country to country.
Determining death rates is especially challenging in the midst of a pandemic, while figures are necessarily fluid. Fatality rates based on comparing deaths, which are relatively easy to count, to infections, which are not, almost certainly overestimate the true lethality of the virus, epidemiologists say. Health officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with undetected infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more.
On top of that, deaths lag infections. The thousands of people with Covid-19 who died this week in the United States were most likely infected as far back as a month ago. So as the number of new cases reported begins to fall in hard-hit places like New York City, the death rate will almost certainly rise.
“To know the fatality rate you need to know how many people are infected and how many people died from the disease,” said Ali H. Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “We know how many people are dying, but we don’t know how many people are infected.”
In fact, even the number of people dying is a moving target. Covid-19 deaths that happen at home appear to be widely underreported. And New York City increased its death count by more than 3,700 on Tuesday, after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died of it.
But the missing data on deaths in the deaths-to-infections ratio is still almost certain to be dwarfed by the expected increase in the denominator when the total number of infections is better understood, epidemiologists say. The statistic typically cited by mayors and governors at Covid-19 news conferences relies on a data set that includes mostly people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested.
Epidemiologists call it “severity bias.” It is why the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, was reported to be between 2 percent and 3.4 percent before it was revised to 1.4 percent, and it may yet be lower.
One intriguing case study for epidemiologists looking for the true fatality rate is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which became a kind of natural experiment when nearly all of its 3,711 passengers and crew members were tested for the coronavirus after an outbreak on board.
The ship’s “case fatality rate,” which included only those who showed symptoms, was 2.6 percent, according to a study by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, while the “infection fatality rate,” which included those who tested positive yet remained asymptomatic, was 1.3 percent. (A cruise ship, in which people are in a confined space, is not representative of the more dynamic situation in cities). The known number of coronavirus cases worldwide is about two million, and at least 127,000 of those patients have died. The United States has an estimated 600,000 reported cases and more than 25,000 deaths, the most in the world. But many people infected with the virus have no symptoms, or only mild ones, and appear in no official tally.
Facing a shortage of tests to confirm who has the disease and who does not, and fearing a shortage of I.C.U. beds, hospitals in some areas of the United States have declined to test or admit people whose oxygen saturation is above 90 percent.
Whether a particular locale tests people with even mild symptoms is a key factor in determining how many people were infected, but testing capacity has been limited in many places.
“People with mild symptoms, I just send them home,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and a critical care physician in Pittsburgh. “All of this is creating disparities in case-fatality ratios that don’t reflect real differences.”
Even with testing now becoming more widely available for Americans with Covid-19 symptoms, the proportion of people infected by the virus who do not feel appreciably sick is unknown, including in places with some of the highest deaths per 100,000 people: New York (55), Spain (40), Belgium (36), Italy (35), New Jersey (32), France (23) and Louisiana (22).
A clue comes from Iceland, which has tested 6 percent of its population, perhaps the highest proportion of any country. Of those who tested positive, 43 percent had no symptoms at the time, though it is likely that many developed them later.
What scientists call the infection fatality rate is so closely watched because even a seemingly trivial decrease — from, say, 1.0 percent to 0.9 percent — could mean a few hundred thousand fewer deaths in a population the size of the United States. It is also used to calibrate interventions aimed at preventing more deaths with their grim economic consequences.
Over the coming months, tests that can identify antibodies in the blood of people who were unwittingly exposed to the virus will allow for a closer approximation of total infections in different populations.
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they would begin using antibody tests to see what proportion of the U.S. population has already been infected. Covid-19 may prove to be less lethal than initial predictions, with an infection fatality rate of under 1 percent, as suggested in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, both of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C.
But the public should not take a false comfort in death-rate statistics that might suddenly seem lower, epidemiologists warn.
The infection fatality rate of seasonal flu strains, which kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, is about 0.1 percent. And as Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, told lawmakers in March when he was urging them to take serious mitigation efforts, the coronavirus “is a really serious problem.”
The inconsistencies in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in different parts of the United States, according to a C.D.C. report released this week, depend on numerous factors: when the first cases of the virus arrived in a region; its population density; and the age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions in its population. Also important are the timing and extent of community mitigation measures introduced by a region’s public officials, its diagnostic testing capacity and its public-health reporting practices.
The same factors most likely apply to the jumble of outcomes across the globe. But which ones end up fueling or mitigating a local outbreak, infectious disease experts say, can be hard to tease out.
The disparity between New York, with 55 deaths per 100,000 people, and California, with two, for instance, has been widely attributed to the imposition of earlier stay-at-home orders in California, which already had a work-at-home culture prepared to embrace the restrictions. But what about New York’s role as the business capital of the world, where travelers returning from Europe unwittingly introduced the coronavirus by mid-February? Or its high population density, which the C.D.C. report suggests may significantly accelerate the transmission of a disease spread by droplets of mucus or saliva?
“The comparison of New York to California is a little unfair in a way,” said Dr. Mokdad of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Yes, in California, the governor put in the shutdown order faster, we shouldn’t take that away from them. But the deck of cards are stacked more against New York.”
Italy’s large number of cases, which overwhelmed its health care system, may be linked to its having the second-oldest population in the world after Japan; likewise The New York Times has identified more than 7,000 deaths at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases.
And the alarming number of African-Americans across many states being killed by Covid-19, health experts said, is likely to be related to higher rates of health conditions, rooted in longstanding economic and health care inequalities, that make it harder for them to survive the infection.
“The state number is an average that masks disparities by county, or even within a county,” Dr. Mokdad said. “Covid-19 is coming on top of underlying population diversity and disparities in health in the United States, and many communities will suffer from it more than other communities.”
Even as parts of the country edge toward reopening, cases are rising in Florida and other Southern states whose governors delayed closing beaches and dine-in restaurants. And it is the virus’s transmission rate, as much as its infection fatality rate, that is preoccupying public health experts trying to find a way forward.
“Everyone in the whole country is vulnerable to this,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “Nobody has pre-immunity. That’s totally unlike flu. So New York had some early cases, it spread like crazy. But why is Des Moines not going to have a Covid epidemic? What’s so special about Springfield, Ill.? Social distancing will end. And people will start getting it again and dying.”",real
342,1257,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/17/long-summer-students-coronavirus-259201,2020-05-17,We’re About to Have the Longest Summer Vacation Ever. That’s Going to Be a Problem.,"The cumulative effect is devastating. In Outliers, the journalist Malcolm Gladwell wrote, “virtually all of the advantage that wealthy students have over poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged students learn when they are not in school.” As Gladwell put it: “America doesn’t have a school problem. It has a summer vacation problem.”

This is about to become the longest summer vacation in American history, which means we can expect the biggest “summer slide” we’ve ever seen. We can either rise to the challenge, and perhaps even reform American education for the better, or leave an entire generation of children behind.

When the coronavirus pandemic struck, the achievement gap between poor and rich students in America had never been greater. According to research by Stanford’s Sean Reardon, among children born in the mid-1990s, the gap in standardized test scores between children from high-income families (defined as the 90th percentile of the income distribution and above) and kids from low-income families (10th percentile and below) was roughly 1.25 standard deviations. That’s 40 percent larger than it was among children born in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. By comparison, racial and ethnic achievement gaps narrowed over the same period.

Summer slides are especially pernicious because their effects are cumulative. By the time a student gets to middle school, they’ve lost an average of two years to summer slide. At higher grade levels, the effect grows even stronger. Ninety percent of teachers say they have to reteach material after school reopens in the fall. The consequences of a six-month summer vacation are almost impossible to imagine.

Moreover, the effects of summer slide extend far beyond testing outcomes. For example, low-income students who experience the greatest summer learning loss are more likely to drop out of high school. That’s because lapses in school not only produce losses in learning, but, as Alexander and his colleagues wrote, also “losses in health and well-being, college and career opportunity, and support needed to break cycles of inter-generational poverty and move young people and their families forward.”

Learning opportunities and life outcomes are deeply and complexly interrelated, and the relationship works in both directions. Everyone understands today, if they didn’t already, that disparities in health outcomes are the product of many factors. Economically disadvantaged people are, of course, less likely to have health insurance. They’re also more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, and breathe bad air—all of which are risk factors for Covid-19.

Educational outcomes are similarly multifactorial. In the best circumstances, to learn well a student needs good food, a sense of well-being, enough money to afford books and transportation, and a reasonably stable support structure. Now add to that list a high-speed internet connection, a decent computer, a quiet space where they can close the door and be free from distractions, and a schedule that allows them to work on the teacher’s timetable.

None of my students have everything on that list. Many don’t even have one. If one acknowledges this reality, it becomes obvious that this will be a formidable problem to solve.

Another daunting dynamic of the crisis is the lag between actions taken now and their later consequences. It’s part of what makes it so tough to slow down coronavirus. People going to beaches today will cause a spike in infection in two weeks, but because the data lags, people don’t perceive the connection. Education data is even slower—the lag is counted in years, not weeks. With standardized testing suspended in many states, it may be half a decade or more before we know the full cost of this tragedy.

But as certainly as epidemiologists know that relaxing social distancing measures will cause people to die, we know that closing schools will cause economically disadvantaged students to fall further behind. All students will suffer, but the poorest students will suffer the most.

And it might not just be one six-month summer vacation. Some schools are likely to remain closed in the next academic year. Others will remain online for the foreseeable future. Students of limited means may decide to forswear traditional schools in favor of less expensive online degrees. Our already massive educational inequalities are about to get far, far worse. Today’s elementary students will be in my college classroom in a decade. Without immediate action, the resulting gap in educational outcomes will be impossible to repair.

Needless to say, a problem of this magnitude doesn’t lend itself to a single, easy solution, but it’s at least possible to imagine the outline of a constructive approach to mitigating these disparities.

A first step is to recognize the importance of synchronous learning. Platforms like Zoom, which I’ve used for years, create an opportunity for students to interact with their peers. So much of what teachers provide—even at the college level—is an environment for social and emotional learning. For that to occur, there needs to be interpersonal group contact. Synchronous learning also provides a structure to the day that’s essential, especially for younger students. Traditionally, that’s been shaped by classrooms and schools. Now it needs to be replicated online.

But online learning requires Internet access, and digital inequality is a national problem. In New York City, 300,000 students live in homes without a computer. CUNY, like many public colleges, has made heroic efforts to educate its students. In late March, the university closed for a brief recalibration period to remedy, as best it could, inequities in access to technology. Even while facing budget shortfalls, within a week CUNY distributed 30,000 laptops and moved almost all of its classes online.

Still, a laptop doesn’t solve the problem; students also need connectivity. More than 12 million children don’t have Internet access at home, and nearly a quarter of teenagers from impoverished homes say they lack a reliable Internet connection or computer. Furthermore, Zoom doesn’t work especially well without a high-speed data connection. Many elite colleges have been unwilling to fund Internet access for low-income students. With libraries and Starbucks off limits, it’s time to realize that a computer isn’t much use without a WiFi hotspot to go with it. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel has recommended using its Universal Service Fund, which historically has been dedicated to helping schools pay for high-speed broadband connection, to reimburse schools and libraries for the purchase and loaning out of Wi-Fi hotspots to students who lack adequate access. This would be a good start.

Second, schools at every level need to stop using homework as a substitute for classroom learning. At the onset of the pandemic, no one knew for sure how long the school shutdowns would last. To get through a couple of weeks, it might make sense to send home assignments as a stopgap strategy.

But simply posting assignments overwhelms students and parents, and it exacerbates achievement gaps because some parents can manage better than others. Even in the best of circumstances—when homework is used strategically to reinforce concepts taught in school—homework disadvantages poorer students. Schools that are relying on home assignments without accompanying teaching will see large drops in achievement. I’m shocked that even at top colleges, many professors are relying heavily or evenly exclusively on assignments.

Third, schools and the communities around them need to start thinking much more creatively about how they use their space and resources. Right now, with classes cancelled, schools are underutilized behemoths. Can we repurpose these physical structures to support online learning? Colleges and high schools may not be able to open to the entire community, but they easily can create socially distanced spaces that could be utilized by students without Internet access.

Similarly, the traditional division of the school day into periods makes a lot of sense when you’re moving thousands of people from one place to another inside a building or on a campus, but no one’s moving around a school right now. Instead of offering calculus third and fifth period, how about offering one section during the day and another at night, taught by different teachers with different family needs? Or, better still, flip the classroom and let students learn at their own pace.",real

365,762,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/vitamin-d-levels-appear-have-role-covid-19-mortality/,2020-05-11,Vitamin D Levels Appear To Have A Role In COVID-19 Mortality,"It may be a good idea to spend some time in the sun, especially for those with preexisting conditions and those worried about COVID-19, as recent research suggests that patients with severe vitamin D deficiency are twice as likely to experience major complications.

Patient data was analyzed from 10 countries which revealed a correlation between low levels of vitamin D and hyperactive immune systems; vitamin D strengthens innate immunity and prevents overactive immune responses and these findings may help to explain several mysteries including why children are unlikely to die from this disease.

The research team led by Northwestern University conducted a statistical analysis of data from clinics and hospitals across America, Spain, Switzerland, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, China, and the UK; patients residing in countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates were noted to have had lower levels of vitamin D compared to those in countries that were not as severely affected.

""While I think it is important for people to know that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in mortality, we don't need to push vitamin D on everybody,"" said Northwestern's Vadim Backman, who led the research. ""This needs further study, and I hope our work will stimulate interest in this area. The data also may illuminate the mechanism of mortality, which, if proven, could lead to new therapeutic targets.""

Inspired to examine the unexplained differences in COVID-19 mortality rates from country to country with some suggesting it was due to age distributions, testing rates, different strains of the virus, or differences in healthcare the team remained skeptical of those hypotheses and looked for a common denominator.

""None of these factors appears to play a significant role,"" Backman said. ""The healthcare system in northern Italy is one of the best in the world. Differences in mortality exist even if one looks across the same age group. And, while the restrictions on testing do indeed vary, the disparities in mortality still exist even when we looked at countries or populations for which similar testing rates apply.” ""Instead, we saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency.”

Analyzing publicly available patient data from the various countries around the globe allowed the team to discover the strong correlation between vitamin D levels and the cytokine storm caused by the overactive immune system, as well as a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the increased mortality rate.

""Cytokine storm can severely damage lungs and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients,"" said first author Ali Daneshkhah. ""This is what seems to kill a majority of COVID-19 patients, not the destruction of the lungs by the virus itself. It is the complications from the misdirected fire from the immune system.""

This is where vitamin D is believed to play a key role, as not only does it boost the innate immune systems, it also prevents the immune system from becoming dangerously over active; meaning that maintaining healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients from severe complications which may include death from COVID-19.

""Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,"" Backman said. ""It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.""

This correlation may explain why childrens are less likely to die from this disease, as they don’t have a fully developed acquired immune system which is the immune system’s second line of defense and is more likely to overreact. ""Children primarily rely on their innate immune system,"" Backman said. ""This may explain why their mortality rate is lower.""

The researchers caution that this does not mean that everyone needs to start hoarding vitamin D supplements, especially those without a known deficiency. All one needs to do to boost vitamin D levels is to spend about 10 to 30 minutes a day in direct sunlight a few times per week, which is free. Also it is important not to take excessive doses of vitamin D supplements which could have some negative side effects. Backman suggests that more research is required to determine the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19.

""It is hard to say which dose is most beneficial for COVID-19,"" Backman said. ""However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.""",fake

But for some Americans, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis intersects with another long-standing pandemic: our nation’s ongoing gun epidemic and weak gun laws, creating unique challenges that Congress must address as it contemplates a fourth stimulus measure.

In fact, while public mass shootings may have fallen in the months of COVID-19, everyday gun violence, violence that results from domestic abuse, suicides, and unintentional shootings may be increasing. Data analyzed by Guns Down America from the Gun Violence Archive shows that nationally, fatalities from gun violence increased 14 percent in the first two weeks of April this year compared to the same period last year. Firearm fatalities rose by over 10 percent when compared to the first half of April 2018.

Opinion

In Chicago, the police department is reporting a double-digit increase in gun incidents compared to this time last year, forcing community organizations like Chicago Cred to fight two public health crises simultaneously: preaching violence reduction in hotspots throughout the city while delivering basic goods and education to communities in need. Philadelphia is similarly experiencing a 17 percent increase in shootings compared to this time last year; and in Baltimore, gun incidents increased so dramatically toward the end of March that Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young begged residents to “put down the guns.”

Many city leaders fear that shootings may increase further once lockdowns are lifted and the weather improves.

Simultaneously, at least 142 American cities and counties in 48 states are reporting significant spikes in calls to domestic violence hotlines, and we’re reading heartbreaking media reports of COVID-related homicides, unintentional shootings and multiple homicide suicides connected to the stress, anxiety, and economic hardship of the current pandemic. As three doctors recently observed in the Annals of Internal Medicine, America is “a society now primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by COVID-19.”

Their prediction rings even more true in light of media reports of panic-fueled gun purchases and FBI data showing that federally licensed gun dealers requested one million more background checks in March of 2020 than they did in March of 2019.

A spike in gun deaths is not inevitable; Congress can save thousands of lives if it addresses the consequences of the coronavirus gun violence surge by adding key provisions to the next stimulus measure.

First, lawmakers should provide additional funding to the FBI to process the surge in background checks we’re experiencing. After all, the FBI conducted a record 3,740,688 background checks in March of 2020, including the highest single day on record on March 20, with 210,208 checks. In March of 2019, an FBI official admitted to Congress that the current background check system was already strained, with the bureau having to pull staff from other departments in order to handle surges in requests.

Congress should close the Charleston loophole once and for all. The loophole, which allows gun dealers to sell firearms when the FBI is unable to complete a background check in three days, permitted a white supremacist to obtain a gun and assassinate nine people at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. More than 270,000 background checks are not completed in this three-day-window each year, resulting in thousands of individuals, whose background checks later revealed they were prohibited from owning firearms, accessing deadly weapons.

Every 16 hours, an American woman is fatally shot by a current or former intimate partner, a horrific statistic that will likely worsen as tens of thousands of women remain stuck at home with their abusers during a period of intense and unprecedented emotional and economic anxiety. A bipartisan group of senators and representatives have already requested additional funding for domestic violence services. Congress should appropriate such funds and extend additional dollars to suicide prevention to ensure that law enforcement, domestic service providers and the courts are able to coordinate and provide safety to those at risk.

Our lawmakers must also extend federal grants to frontline gun violence intervention workers serving communities already disproportionately impacted by the virus. Congress must recognize that evidence-based intervention initiatives are essential for ending cycles of violence and, during these trying times, virus spread.

Finally, gun violence prevention advocates and gun enthusiasts agree that the surge in first-time gun buyers rushing out to purchase firearms in the midst of a national health pandemic (without first receiving the proper training) will lead to more instances of unintentional shootings and other gun tragedies. Lawmakers must provide funding for public education efforts around the danger of untrained individuals bringing something far more deadly into their home than coronavirus and the importance of safe gun storage.

Unless Congress acts, for far too many people the thing that cuts their lives short won’t be coronavirus, but a gun.

367,882,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/13/21257651/illinois-coronavirus-pritzker-cases-deaths-may-13,2020-05-13,Fears and frustration as Illinois sees deadliest COVID-19 day yet: ‘This is a real disease. This is a serious disease. It’s not a hoax’,"Illinois saw its deadliest day yet from COVID-19, with another 192 Illinoisans losing their lives, officials said Wednesday.

It marks the highest death toll in a 24-hour period since the virus began its spread. And the dire numbers prompted Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his public health chief to offer some of their strongest words about the virus that has so far claimed 3,792 lives in Illinois.

“They’re not just numbers and statistics,” said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, head of the Illinois Public Health Department. “These are real people. and there are families and loved ones who are suffering with each of them, whether in their illness or in their unfortunate passing.”

The governor questioned how anyone could read those numbers any other way.

“One-hundred-ninety-two Illinoisans have lost their lives to this virus in the past 24 hours. 192. How is that not real to you?” Pritzker said to elected officials — and business owners — objecting to his stay-at-home order extension. “More people will get sick and admitted to the hospital and die if we don’t stay the course and follow the guidance the experts have provided.”

The Illinois Department of Public Health also reported 1,677 new cases, bringing the state’s total to 84,698. The state received 17,668 test results and has performed 489,359 total tests.

Wednesday also marked the 16th day with more than 100 lives lost, and resumed an especially deadly period for the virus in Illinois, bringing the number dead this month alone to 1,459.

The governor’s administration released new projections on Monday from researchers that indicate the state will see a range of 50 to 150 deaths a day into June or July. Northwestern University, one of three universities involved in the state’s projections, has predicted a more dire daily range of 50 to 300 deaths.

Ezike called on Illinoisans to be patient and keep following the guidelines, whether they know someone afflicted with the disease or not.

“This is a real disease. This is a serious disease. It’s not a hoax.

“And people need to take it very seriously. Please continue to stay home. Please maintain physical separation or social distancing. Please wear your masks.

“Please help us decrease the spread of this virus. And please help us save lives.”

Pritzker’s administration has said the deaths are a lagging indicator of the virus’ spread and are difficult to predict since the virus may affect people differently. Ezike last week said 90% of the fatalities in Illinois have been people with other chronic conditions including heart disease and diabetes. But the fact that Illinoisans are largely abiding by the stay-at-home order extension, and there are still a large number of fatalities is frustrating the many people stuck working at home, or worse, unemployed during the pandemic.

“Folks, I know this is hard. I know that people are hurting,” Pritzker said during his briefing. “This virus has taken many lives and destroyed many livelihoods. COVID-19 has turned our world upside down and stolen our sense of normalcy and stability. I want this to end as much as you do.”

The governor also on Wednesday said all residents and staff at the state’s four veterans homes have been tested for COVID-19. Pritzker said a coronavirus patient at the home in Manteno died. At Anna Veterans’ Home there have been five positive cases; in Manteno, 30 residents and 19 employees who tested positive. At the LaSalle Veterans’ Home, there has been one positive case. None have been reported at the Quincy Veterans’ Home.

At the state’s nursing homes, the public health department is testing all residents and staffers, even without known outbreaks. Tests are also being provided for all employees with known cases. So far, there have been 30,000 tests provided to 129 facilities.

The state as of Friday had lost 1,553 nursing home residents to COVID-19. The public health department has been updating those figures once a week.

Pritzker this week has been delivering his daily briefing from his home office after a senior staffer tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.",real

The Arkansas-based company said the closure of the plant in Waterloo would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt U.S. meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.

The plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for 3.9% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.

More than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.

In addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.

Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.

Several facilities have temporarily closed due to virus outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota, and a Redwood Farms Meat Processors in Estherville, Iowa. Others have stayed open or resumed production after pauses for testing and cleaning.

An estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity has been closed or idled due to reduced operating speed over the past two days, said Steve Meyer, an economist with Kerns and Associates in Ames, Iowa.

As a result, prices are starting to increase and analysts warn that customers could soon see shortages of certain products at grocery stores. At the same time, hog prices are plummeting due to excess supply, devastating farmers.

In Kansas, a critical beef production state, an official said Wednesday that 168 meatpacking workers had tested positive to date. In Missouri, two rural counties that are home to several meatpacking plants reported huge spikes in infections.

Tyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer said its Waterloo closure was driven by “the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns.” He warned of “significant ramifications” for farmers, distributors and grocers in the supply chain.

Tyson said workers would be compensated during the shutdown and that the timing of reopening would depend on several factors, including testing.

Local officials, including Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and the Black Hawk County Board of Health, had called on Tyson or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. They had warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus in the area and that the company was endangering its workers.

A 65-year-old employee in the plant’s laundry department died Sunday after contracting the virus, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported.

The governor blocked local authorities from closing the plant in an April 16 order that banned social gatherings in northeastern Iowa. It granted the exclusive power to the Iowa Department of Public Health to shut down businesses over coronavirus concerns.

The governor and the department had been working with Tyson to keep the plant open.

Reynolds argued that the economic disruption caused by plant closures outweighed the health risks, warning that farmers might have to euthanize their pigs. She said that “people are gonna get” the virus in large workplaces but most will experience mild or no symptoms.

While it’s true that for most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks, it can lead to more severe illness and even death for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.

Lawmakers said an earlier closure would have better protected public health and been less harmful economically. “My concern is the impact this has had because we didn’t act soon enough,” said Democratic Rep. Ras Smith of Waterloo.

The governor didn’t respond directly when asked Wednesday if the state should have intervened. She defended her overall response to the crisis but said, “There’s always more we could have done.”

Tyson resumed operations Tuesday at its pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, which had been shut down for two weeks after an outbreak infected hundreds and killed two workers.",real

This week, many countries in Europe have started lifting the restrictions that had been introduced in connection with the spread of the coronavirus infection. It does not mean that the pandemic has been defeated: a new “hot spot” is beginning to emerge more and more clearly on the continent. Unfortunately, it goes about Russia.

177 160 confirmed cases of COVID-2019 infection

Of these, 11,231 were detected in the last 24 hours.

More than half of those infected are still in Moscow.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says:

""The fact that we have identified so many infected people is a huge plus, but not a minus, because it means that infected people are quarantined in a timely manner, and the spread of the virus is slowing down.""

Another “plus” in comparison with other countries is the relatively low mortality rate among coronavirus patients:

1,625 people have died in the country during the epidemic (as of May 8, 2020)

According to the authorities, the outbreak of the epidemic in Russia started later than in many other countries, and Russia had time to get prepared for the challenge.

On May 7, Russia was ranked fifth in the world in the number of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, the Russian authorities decided to gradually lift quarantine restrictions. For example, courts will resume their work from May 12. Industrial and construction companies will start operating in Moscow too. However, the quarantine restrictions will not touch upon citizens and small businesses. On the contrary, the measures will be toughened, and the Russians will have to pay for those restrictions from their own pockets.

From May 12, Moscow is introducing the mask regime in the city. One will be required to wear a face mask or a respirator to be able to use the metro or public transport. In addition, one will have to wear gloves. To comply with these requirements, every Muscovite will have to spend at least 2,000 rubles a month.",fake

FromÂ vinegar to radiation, professionals have toutedÂ a host of products and practices alleged to be effective against COVID-19.

With each passing week, there seems to be a new and improved instant âfixâ to the disease. That said, most of theseÂ fixes are proven to be ineffective and based on no scientific evidence whatsoever.

How to prepare for COVID-19

With the pandemic still ongoing, COVID-19 remains an active area of research. Scientists are moving at a snail’s pace when it comes to understanding the new coronavirus, but it cannot be helped.

What can be helped, though, is our bodies. As with most infections and diseases, a person is more susceptible to pathogens if he or she isn’t fit to begin with. While it’s true that the virus can still latch onto the healthiest individuals, watching out for certain biomarkers of poor health can afford us time to turn things around before it’s too late.

With that, here are some helpful tips toÂ follow in preparation for COVID-19:

Watch out for signs of diabetes

According to recent reports from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to severe complications linked to COVID-19.

One reason for this is that infections tend to be harder to cure in general for people with diabetes due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels and the presence of diabetes complications. People with chronic diseases like diabetes also tend to be immunocompromised, thus making them more susceptible to COVID-19.

If you haven’t been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, some signs to watch out for include increased thirst, frequent urination, sudden weight loss, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, tender gums and frequent infections.

Avoid foods that raise cholesterol and blood pressure

Heart health depends on two major factors: cholesterol and blood pressure. Excess cholesterol can lead to clogged arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. High blood pressure, on the other hand, often leads to arterial stiffness, another major factor for heart disease.

Like diabetes, heart disease makes a person more susceptible to severe complications related to COVID-19. People with heart disease tend to be weaker in general due to poor blood circulation. To support heart health, avoid the following foods:Â pastries, processed meat, red meat and canned foods.

Quit smoking

The Wuhan coronavirus targets the lungs, so quitting or refraining from smoking should be a no-brainer. A recent review published inÂ Tobacco Induced DiseasesÂ established that smoking is associated with theÂ negative progression and adverse outcomesÂ of COVID-19.

In particular, smoking can exacerbate complications linked to pneumonia and the flu, two infectious diseases with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. These complications include wheezing, shortness of breath, chronic coughs, chest pain and fever.

Exercise often

There is no conclusive evidence that being fit reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19, but recent studies show that exercise helps strengthen the immune system.

Exercise, in particular, can help flush out bacteria and other pathogens from the lungs, thus reducing the risk of catching a cold, flu and other similar infections.

Exercise also stimulates antibodies and white blood cells to work harder, resulting in the better detection of harmful pathogens. The rise in temperature after a period of exercise can also inhibit bacterial growth in the lungs.

In addition, exercise helps reduce cholesterol and regulate blood pressure.

Lose weight

Overweight individuals are at an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. As discussed earlier, conditions like these can compromise an individual’s immune functions and make them more susceptible to COVID-19.

As such, it’s important to follow a balanced diet. Diabetic or obese individuals can take it a step further and follow a plant-based diet.Â This diet can include animal products, but a large chunk of it should be comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish and olive oil.

Coupling a balanced diet with regular exercise can also help burn excess weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Maintaining a healthy body and a strong immune system greatly reduces your risk of catching COVID-19.Â (Related: Strengthen the immune system with these 12 superfoods.)

385,1647,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-21-coronavirus-vaccines-will-contain-aborted-human-babies.html,2020-05-21,CONFIRMED: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies,"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.

Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

Paul Stone, who had served as Hertz's executive vice president and chief retail operations officer, North America, will become CEO and president immediately, the company announced Monday.

Marinello's resignation was reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated May 15. She will remain with Hertz in a consulting position for up to one year to support a smooth transition, the company says.

""Having successfully run our largest business segment for the last two years, Paul helped strengthen our brands by elevating service standards across the North American car rental operations."" said Henry R. Keizer, Hertz's chairman, in a statement.

Prior to joining Hertz in March 2018, Stone, 50, served as senior vice president and chief retail officer at Cabela's. He began his career with Sam's Club and Walmart where he became western U.S. divisional senior vice president.

""I thank Kathy and look forward to working with my colleagues to do what Hertz people do best – anticipate where transportation, mobility and technology are going and innovate to best serve our customers, stakeholders and communities,"" Stone said in a statement.

Marinello's departure comes about two weeks after Hertz, in a separate SEC filing, said it had begun negotiating with lenders to negotiate ""a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact"" of COVID-19.

Hertz's action then came amid widespread reports that the company was headed toward a potential bankruptcy filing.

In the May 4 filing, the company said it ""faces significant ongoing operating expenses,"" including agreements that commit the company to leasing more vehicles than it currently needs. Hertz had announced April 14 that it would cut about 10,000 jobs.

Two months ago, when Hertz announced furloughs, Marinello said she would give up 100% of her base salary. According to an SEC filing, Marinello earned more than $8 million in total compensation in 2018. That included a base salary of $1.45 million, which remains the same under a new employment agreement she signed in November.

""The hardest part about stepping down is leaving the amazing employees that have earned my respect over the last three-and-a-half years. It was an honor to serve them,"" said Marinello. ""I am confident that under Paul's leadership, Hertz will prosper long into the future.""",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Opinion contributor

As strange as it may sound, we need to plan now for a dynamic post-pandemic world.

The unique circumstances of the crisis have unleashed a wave of innovation and prompted unprecedented levels of regulatory relief as we deal with both a health and an economic crisis.

Hundreds, if not thousands, of rules and regulations at the federal and state levels have been lifted or relaxed during the pandemic.

At the same time, American workers — from employees in large companies to gig hustlers — are adapting and innovating in new ways and at new speeds. Our “new normal” in the future should incorporate lessons learned from this period.

Congress could help by creating an independent commission to study how laws and regulations inhibited or facilitated innovation and adaptation during the crisis. Dynamism means much more than “light touch” regulatory agencies. It is also about encouraging a culture of creative experimentation at all levels of the economy.

The innovation we are seeing during the crisis, from accelerated drug approvals to small-scale personal protective equipment production, should help guide our regulatory reform efforts in the future.

The national commission should include state representatives among its members, or encourage parallel state commissions, because many limits to dynamism exist at the state level. Previous ideas for regulatory commissions, both in the United States and abroad, could serve as a model for Congress.

4 ways to drive innovation

Initially, the commission could concentrate on four factors that have been revolutionized by innovation during the pandemic:

►Speed. COVID-19 has forced many companies to discard protocols to adapt to our new reality. The most obvious example is in pharmaceutical development. It hasn’t been perfect, but drug companies and regulators are learning to share information more effectively and undo requirements that slow progress.

The commission could look at how new information and supercomputing systems — together with simpler, more standardized clinical trials — could lower costs and speed up drug development.

More generally, during the pandemic, companies have been reinventing processes and systems practically overnight, from supply chain management in food delivery to sporting goods purchases and 3D printing. A commission should study the manner in which the regulatory environment interacted with such innovation, whether positively or negatively.

►Distance. The process for removing barriers to physical distance will accelerate after the crisis. One obvious example is telemedicine. There is no need to go to the doctor’s office unless medically necessary; yet state licensing and referral laws complicate telehealth and should be reworked.

Distance learning has now become the norm by the sheer force of school closures, and parents and employers understandably want to see kids back in school as soon as possible. But new opportunities for remote learning models should emerge from this experience, and state requirements should adapt to them.

Other distance-reducing technologies range from increasing the use of drones to deliver products to expanded broadband access to rural areas, all of which have implications for regulatory frameworks.

►Health. New ways of detecting and dealing with health threats are set to proliferate because of the coronavirus. Innovation on this front is already exploding. From reusable protective masks, to health apps that detect symptoms and deliver medical advice, to detection kits that produce immediate results for multiple viruses, the pandemic has prompted a wave of innovation that will improve our quality of life.

We may even have robots in our offices and homes one day that can kill viruses and bacteria without using chemicals, and technology that can “smell” whether viruses are in a room in the first place.

►Business. We should pay special attention to reforms that promote greater adaptability and flexibility, especially among smaller businesses and sole proprietors. The pandemic has prompted a lot of adaptive repurposing in a number of sectors, from local distillers producing hand sanitizer to electronics firms producing protective masks.

Encourage flexibility in business

Our rules should encourage maximum adaptability and flexibility, such as with 3D printing that has allowed small and large companies to fill in gaps in the supply chain. Fintech, the integration of technology into financial services, has grown considerably during the pandemic and made commercial activity easier for small businesses and gig workers.

Rules that inhibit adaptability, such as limits on what health care workers and hospitals can do to meet needs, should be up for review.

We need dynamism to get us through the crisis, and we will need it as we rebuild our economy afterward. Thinking now about how that should look is incredibly important.

411,1254,https://www.newyorker.com/news/us-journal/a-coronavirus-turf-war-in-klickitat-county,2020-05-17,A Coronavirus Turf War in Klickitat County,"“It was unsettling,” David Postman, Inslee’s chief of staff, told me recently, referring to this stretch. “I’ll tell you, I was very alarmed. People were trying to outdo each other.” Meanwhile, the Facebook page for the Klickitat County sheriff’s office was quiet. Merrit Monnat, the farmer in Goldendale, told me that, after Songer’s initial messages, people took the virus more seriously in the area, though maybe not seriously enough. “You still go to the grocery store and most people aren’t wearing masks,” she said. Keethler worried that the work that the state had done in March was at risk of coming undone. “We’re entering into a period where some of our efforts are now being undermined,” she said.

The day after Inslee’s press briefing, I went to see Songer, in Goldendale. As you drive east up the Columbia River gorge, the green of the lower Cascades gives way to yellow, then to brown. Trees disappear. The central and eastern side of Klickitat County has been farming and ranching land for a hundred and fifty years. White turbines loom in the hills above the valley: the county now produces more wind power than any other county in Washington. For a long time, there was a lumber mill in Goldendale, and more recently there was an aluminum plant. Both those industries are gone. The city’s largest employer is a waste-removal company: one of the biggest landfills in the country sits on the eastern edge of Klickitat, near the town of Roosevelt.

Songer’s citizen deputies include Ray Willis, a seventy-nine-year-old cattle and hay rancher, whom I spoke to outside his home. He was standing, unmasked, next to his pickup truck, which bore a decal signalling his membership in the Klickitat County Sheriff Posse Patrol. “I listen to Songer before I listen to the governor,” Willis told me. “That’s for dang sure.” He added, “Bob Songer’s got a pretty good head on his shoulders. He thinks about stuff. I’m not sure about our governor.”

That opinion was echoed by Keith Kreps, a fifth-generation cattle rancher, who spoke to me inside one of his family’s large, old barns north of White Salmon. “It’s like with the guns last year,” Kreps said. “Our sheriff is usually right.” For ranchers like Willis and Kreps, who can go days or weeks without venturing into town, a virus that is often transmitted in large gatherings does not seem all that personally threatening. Kreps operates on forty-four thousand acres. He was worried about the price of beef, which had plummeted, he said, when meat-packing plants began closing, and then rebounded a bit when some came back online. Kreps was afraid that, with the country entering a recession, and the market for beef falling, thieves would come to shoot his cattle, then sell it cheaply in neighboring communities. He said it had happened before, in the seventies.

“It’s good that we live where we do,” Kreps told me, “because we are away from where you have to do all that social distancing.” Just then, a rare visitor pulled up: his daughter-in-law, who had come to say hello. Like Kreps, she was not wearing a mask. After they spoke, Kreps returned to his worries about the commodity business. “They shut down all these packing plants, and that’s where it’s hurting us big time, all across the country,” he said, adding, “We need to get these guys back to work. Because if you have fat cattle to be your best prime rib, and they keep backing up, well, then they get fatter. Bigger costs more. We got to get those packing plants up, even if we got to go run around the clock.” Kreps wasn’t oblivious to the danger of meat-packing plants right now, he said. Along with nursing homes and prisons, meat-packing plants have emerged as one of the major sites of coronavirus outbreaks in the U.S. “We’ve got to get safe in the workplace,” Kreps told me. “I’ve heard all the horror stories about bosses saying you’ve got to come to work during the pandemic or you’re fired or whatever.” He added, “There’s only one way to get this to stop. We’ve got to develop a vaccine. That’s No. 1. But it’s going to take a long time. I’m not a scientist, but I know that.” On my way out, he offered his hand.

By the time I spoke to Kreps, Klickitat had had three confirmed coronavirus deaths, and just nineteen confirmed cases—though only “about four hundred” people in the county had been tested, Kristi Ridgeway, a clinical-division manager with the Klickitat County Health Department, told me. Most of the county’s cases have come in the central zone, which includes Goldendale. “Several of them, we were able to connect the dots—they gave it to each other,” Ridgeway said. “There was a gathering of folks—I can’t tell you more than that. Can’t tell you the town. But it was in mid-March, around when the governor was discussing that we need to limit socializing in groups.” Although Washington’s stay-at-home order was statewide, reopening is happening on a county-by-county basis—larger counties will reopen when they see a declining number of cases, and smaller counties will reopen after they’ve gone three weeks with no new cases. All of this, of course, depends on widespread testing. Ridgeway said that Klickitat had the capacity for such testing—“up to eight or nine thousand, if we had to, in our hospitals,” she said. The county has two hospitals—a community hospital, in Goldendale, and a private hospital, in White Salmon—both of which are conducting tests; hospital groups and clinics have volunteered to send mobile testing groups to the county’s harder-to-reach populations, but this has not happened yet. “Ultimately,” Ridgeway said, “it’s up to people to decide if they want to be” tested, “along with medical providers. Sometimes people with symptoms don’t want to be tested.”",real
429,852,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/13/21257542/elective-surgery-resume-illinois-rush-hospital-richard-berger,2020-05-13,"As elective surgeries resume, out-of-state patients flock to Illinois doctors","Robin Treider and her husband set out Tuesday on a 10-hour drive from their home in Pennsylvania to Oak Brook, where she was set to undergo a long overdue knee replacement surgery just two days after Illinois hospitals resumed elective procedures.

Though Treider said she wasn’t concerned about stepping into a hospital in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it still felt at times like she was riding an “emotional roller coaster.”

“It’s just the normal fears that can pop into your mind of the things that could go wrong,” she said. “And you quickly try to push them away, but they come back.”

Treider is just one of the patients traveling to Illinois to see Dr. Richard Berger of Rush Hospital, one of the first orthopedic surgeons in the Chicago area. While Pennsylvania restarted elective surgeries April 27, Treider said she was willing to wait for Illinois to lift its restrictions because Berger was highly recommended by a friend and she had already been in line for surgery with him.

After postponing surgeries for roughly two months when the coronavirus took hold, Berger said his schedule is now jam-packed with patients eager to go under the knife.

“They planned everything around having surgery done and finally alleviating their pain, finally restoring their function. And then for obviously good reasons, we canceled their surgery or postponed their surgery. And it’s just been heartbreaking for them,” said Berger, who estimated that roughly half of his patients come from outside Illinois.

When elective surgeries resumed Monday in Illinois, hospitals had new safeguards in place to protect patients and medical staff from the deadly virus.

At Rush Oak Brook, where Treider is undergoing surgery, those new measures include strict social distancing guidelines, screening and temperature checks and new requirements for more staff members to wear both masks and gloves. In addition, family members can no longer wait inside the hospital and patients must be tested for COVID-19 ahead of their surgery.

But Berger noted that health care workers have long been taken precautions to prevent the spread of disease. For example, he said his team wears “hermetically-sealed space suits” and performs operations in rooms that are pumped with sterile air that helps filter out “any pathogens, any bacteria [and] any virus.

“We assume every patient has something that we don’t want to get,” he said. “And we assume that no patient wants to get anything that we get.”

As surgeons like Berger have gotten back to work, the Illinois Department of Public Health has made it clear that elective surgeries could again be suspended in the case of a “rapid resurgence or a second wave of COVID-19” or a “decrease in statewide hospital COVID-19 testing levels.”

In retrospect, Berger said, it was unnecessary to shut down elective procedures, which are a vital source of revenue for hospitals. Because everyone is screened at his hospital, Berger claimed that having a joint replacement surgery is currently safer than going to a grocery store or a gas station.

“We were thinking this was going to be Armageddon,” he said. “We thought the hospital would be 100% filled and overspilled. McCormick Place made a makeshift hospital that was going to be filled. Well, it turned out there was no patients that ever went there. Our hospital wasn’t filled. No other hospital was filled.

“Now thank God, of course, but we were wrong.”

Meanwhile, as Treider prepared for her operation on Wednesday morning, her concerns about the procedure have been allayed by her confidence in Berger. An avid tennis player, Treider can’t wait to get the surgery done so she can get back on the court this summer.

“I’m going to be walking around in happy tears,” she said.",real

Shut down most medical procedures. Banish coronavirus patients to nursing homes leading to thousands of deaths. Close down the economy. Watch 1.4 million health care workers lose their jobs. And then hypocritically applaud our heroes some more.

Dayna James has been an emergency nurse for 17 years -- and thought the COVID-19 pandemic would mean she'd have more work than ever. Instead, she's filing for unemployment benefits, an ironic twist of fate shared by 1.4 million of America's 18 million health care personnel who have lost their jobs since March -- including 135,000 hospital workers.

It's not 'ironic'.

Setting a hospital on fire while proclaiming its importance is not ironic. It's evil.

The 40-year-old mother of four lost a two day a week teaching job at a university hospital in March, and is barely getting any work at the children's hospital in Miami where she was previously a regularly contracted nurse.

Clap for our heroes some more. And the politicians who deemed non-coronavirus medicine non-essential. And the media which backed them up.

The American Hospital Association has estimated that losses across the sector for the March-June period will be $200 billion. Dentists' offices have lost 500,000 jobs in one month, according to official statistics. Optometrists and physiotherapists have been similarly affected.

But wait, there's an endgame. Since it's the media, can you guess what it is?

Since there is no single-payer public authority that mediates and caps prices, costs depend on negotiations between hospitals and insurers and have been rising for decades.

If only we had socialized medicine, we'd have even far more lost jobs and worse medical care. But think of this as a dry run.",fake

Outside of Chicago, every other major-league ballpark in a nation felled by the coronavirus is empty, as well. There is hope, however, that the parks will be occupied by teams — but not fans — by early July if team owners and the players’ union can agree on financial terms for what would be perhaps an 82-game season, about half the usual 162.

On Tuesday, the players and owners reportedly discussed health, safety and economics but held off on talking about the hot-button topic, the owners’ proposal for a 50/50 revenue split, a tug-of-war the sides will have to get ironed out in two or three weeks. That would be a “deadline” with a targeted July 1-4 start to the season needed, preceded by a scaled-down spring training of about three weeks.

If you’re one of the millions reeling from the physical, mental or financial effects of the pandemic and hoping for a return of baseball as soon as possible, covering your eyes and ears or shutting down your phone while this gets hashed out might be the thing to do, unless billionaires-vs.-millionaires tiffs are your cup of tea.

The last thing baseball’s image needs is a squabble between the two sides, but that’s what we’re probably going to get.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker took the owners’ side Tuesday, saying “fans deserve their pastime back” and that he is “disappointed that players are holding out for these very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.”

It’s the players, though, not the owners, who would be taking health risks by playing baseball again.

When we last saw the Cubs and Sox playing on March 12, when spring training was shut down and the start of the season delayed, both teams were enthused about embarking on stepping-stone seasons, the Sox to a window of contention and the Cubs to a new era under new manager David Ross, trying to keep their closing window propped up.

If the owners and the players’ union settle on a deal, we’ll see a schedule that will keep the crosstown series intact. Each team would play opponents in its own division, plus interleague games limited to National League Central (Cubs) vs. American League Central (Sox), NL East vs. AL East and NL West vs. AL West. Seeing them on TV or listening on the radio only is likely with games being played in empty ballparks, at least initially.

Rosters will expand from 26 to 30 with “taxi squads” of up to 20 players available to reinforce rosters, playoff teams will increase from 10 to 14 and the designated hitter will be used by NL teams (new for them) as well as AL teams.

That shouldn’t be a problem for the Cubs, who have a natural DH in Kyle Schwarber.

A much tougher problem to solve is a financial meeting of the minds between owners and players. With about 40 percent of revenue coming from tickets, concessions and various gate-related cash, the owners are angling for the revenue split. The union is having none of it, calling it a salary cap. They agreed in March to prorated salaries based on games played.

“That the league is trying to take advantage of a global health crisis to get what they’ve failed to achieve in the past ... suggests they know exactly how this will be received,” MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark told The Athletic on Monday.

“None of this is beneficial to the process of finding a way for us to safely get back on the field and resume the 2020 season — which continues to be our sole focus.”",real

Opinion contributor

Think of your favorite small business. It might be the corner shop where you grab coffee on the way to work, the barbershop where you get your hair cut, or the restaurant you take your kids to on special occasions. Now imagine how much you’d miss it if it disappeared.

If you live in University City, Missouri, it might be EyeSeeMe — a book shop with a difference. Inspired by their four kids, Pamela and Jeffrey Blair created a place where black children can discover role models and learn about African American history. It has become an important part of the community, serving people in their store and working with schools, day care and colleges to educate kids across the local area.

But the coronavirus pandemic turned everything upside down. Their store, like so many others, closed its doors. Pamela and Jeffrey have used all their creativity to try to make their business work online. They’re pushing online sales, selling subscriptions to boxes of books delivered every two weeks, and hosting story time readings with authors on Facebook Live. But they’ve had to rely on the goodwill of their community to stay afloat, raising money through a GoFundMe campaign.

A measure of COVID-19 shutdowns

Small businesses like EyeSeeMe are the heartbeat of our communities, and they're in real trouble. The new State of Small Business Report by Facebook and the Small Business Roundtable shows just how much.

Based on a survey of 86,000 owners, managers and workers in U.S. companies with fewer than 500 employees, the report is a sobering snapshot of the struggle they find themselves in. Since the first shelter-in-place orders, it has been clear that many businesses were going to take a big hit, but now we can hear from the people behind the businesses just how big it is.

Nearly a third told us they have stopped operating entirely. For the smallest businesses — those run by the self-employed or for personal income — the situation is worse. More than half are no longer operating. That is especially bad for women, who run the majority of these businesses.

A particularly concerning finding is that fewer than half of those surveyed said they expected to be able to rehire the same workers when they reopen. And many businesses that remain in operation face two big challenges: cash and customers. Nearly three in 10 said the biggest challenge they face over the next few months will be cash flow, while 20% said it will be lack of demand.

Like Pamela and Jeffrey, many are trying to pivot their operations online. Just over half said they were increasing their online interaction with customers, with more than a third now doing all their selling virtually.

Running a small business is tiring in the best of times. But as the report illustrates so starkly, the challenges of staying afloat during this turmoil can be overwhelming. Nearly half of all owners and managers report feeling burned out trying to take care of business and household responsibilities at the same time.

Few expect their businesses to fail

Yet despite all this, there is huge resilience and a surprising amount of optimism. More than half of those surveyed said they are optimistic or extremely optimistic about the future of their businesses, and a small fraction — just 11% — expect their business to fail if conditions persist for the next three months.

Facebook is in the business of small business. Some 160 million businesses use our apps every month — nearly one business for every 55 people on the planet, all using Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp to reach customers. Big brands use them, as do local coffee shops, barbershops, restaurants and, yes, bookstores. And for every one of those 160 million, there are people earning livelihoods and customers using products or services.

The State of Small Business Report is the first of an ongoing series tracking the situation facing small businesses across the country. These were planned before the virus struck, and we had anticipated that they would paint a much brighter picture of American businesses. Instead, the findings bring home the scale of the crisis our economy is facing and can point us to where help is most needed.

Above all, we hope that the optimism of small business owners is well-founded, and that future reports will tell a story of recovery and better times to come.

Coronavirus has dramatically changed the world in which we live today. In fact, the world is changing before our very eyes, rapidly.

Many experts are convinced that the world is not going to be the same after the coronavirus pandemic. Today, the best place to be is home, countries have closed their borders and limited travel between cities.

Of course, it will end some day, but people will not be able to return to their habitual lifestyle after the pandemic.

As observer Nikolai Grinko notes, modern technology will change along with habits and rituals. Not ÐµÑÐµ long ago, many of us wondered why so many people in Asia wear masks in the streets.

Today, everyone knows about the need for masks, disposable gloves and sanitizers.

Many of us will keep the habit of washing their hands thoroughly, for not less than 20 seconds. New anti-virus coatings will be developed, because viruses can be destroyed on the surface of certain metals.

One may expect ""antiviral"" handrails in the subway, door handles and elevator buttons. Thin metal threads will be weaved into fabrics, so we will soon have clothes to protect us from infection.

Remote medicine will be developing as well. It goes about personal health monitoring systems. Many people can already monitor their basic vial signs, such as heartrate, blood pressure, we can track the number of steps taken and calories burned — one does not need to go to the hospital for this.

Many conservative things will also change. In the field of travel, for example, after quarantine is lifted, all tourists will be required to take tests and show certificates proving that they have no coronavirus infection.

Preventive measures at airports and train stations will work differently too. Transport will change too — there are projects to install special protective screens between chairs in trains and aircraft.",fake
442,1327,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-makes-everything-worse-for-pedro-sanchez/,2020-05-18,Coronavirus makes everything worse for Pedro Sánchez,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Opinion contributor

Whether or not we’re willing to admit it, nearly all of us are experiencing a form of trauma because of the coronavirus pandemic. Uncertainty, stress and anxiety are running high.

A recent Common Sense Media and Survey Monkey report found that 61% of teens surveyed reported feeling worried about themselves (or someone in their family) getting sick; 63% reported feeling worried about their family’s ability to make a living; and 42% reported feeling more lonely than usual.

Many parents have lost work and are struggling to provide for their families’ basic needs. Other parents are attempting to work full-time while also caring for their children and overseeing their remote learning. We are grieving the loss of the lives we once knew.

For students, not being able to see friends, participate in regularly scheduled activities or engage in their normal routines is incredibly disruptive. And we, as parents, are learning just how hard it is to get our kids to focus when they’re emotionally distant or distracted — a task even more difficult for educators.

With schools across the country closed, districts acknowledge that student learning capacity is taking a hit. While we’re more forgiving about the number of academic hours logged, school districts can step up in other ways now and when we prepare to return: by supporting students’ social and emotional wellness.

Students need social and emotional support, and this cannot just be the job of therapists and mental health professionals, especially when schools already face a shortage of psychologists and counselors. The current 430-to-1 ratio of students to counselors in the U.S. falls far short of the American School Counselor Association recommendation of 250-to-1.

Teachers, whether they’re working in buildings or remotely, may interact with their students more regularly than anyone else. They need the tools to be able to proactively check in with students’ feelings and practice social emotional skills that will help students cope through the pandemic and beyond.

Beginning classes with a quick check in can go a long way. Asking students to share how they are feeling, a challenge they are facing, or a hope they have for the week can help educators gauge what burdens students are carrying. Every student might not have the words or vocabulary, so using facial expressions or creative modes such as drawing or poetry can bridge the gap. Guiding these conversations can feel tricky and maybe even uncomfortable at first, which is why teachers need a structured framework.

Some people argue that these skills should be practiced in the home, and not in the school. But we’re now in a position where school is in the home. We have a huge opportunity to distribute virtual social and emotional learning tools across the country to support our students, teachers and school communities through this pandemic and beyond.

Stress affects ability to learn

The fact is, our children’s stressors and their inability to properly manage their emotions prevent them from being effective learners. Much like you wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without fueling your body, we cannot expect students to learn without strengthening their minds and their hearts. With studies that show extreme stress can disrupt the architecture of a growing brain, grades don’t matter so much now.

With the emphasis on remote instruction and thinking through what school will look like when we return to “normal,” I urge districts and policy makers to invest in the healing and rebuilding of our whole selves that’s required for us to function at the highest level.

To do this right, we need to teach skills such as emotional identification, expression and management alongside foundational relationship skills and problem-solving strategies. When we provide this foundation for all students, we cultivate a more supportive learning environment and can better understand which students need additional support.

Help students process emotions

COVID-19 will leave a lasting mark. We’re going to need support to heal and grow in its aftermath. While states are re-opening and discussing how to eventually go back to school, most of the focus is on physical safety — masks, temperature checks, extra hand sanitizer, maintaining distancing. But how will your first-grader feel when they can no longer see the smile behind their teacher’s mask, exchange a high five to celebrate a job well done, or receive a hug when they seek a moment of comfort? How will they learn if they’re afraid?

Social emotional learning supports will be essential in helping students process the feelings and emotions that have surfaced as a result of living through a pandemic. Those same supports will help build a foundation for students to express themselves in healthy ways so they can learn and grow for the rest of their lives.

And that could mean 50 to 150 Illinoisans losing their lives to the coronavirus a day – or possibly as many as 300 each day.

Those were some of the grim estimates Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered from his own home on Monday, a mix of troubling projections coupled with a few optimistic signs of progress for parts of the state outside the Chicago area.

The daily death toll Monday was 54, at the low end of the projections for the peak period. But that follows an especially deadly week, and it was announced amid a new round of scientific modeling.

And those dire projections come at an extremely inopportune time for the Democratic governor, who is facing criticism from Republican legislators, unemployed workers who appear stuck in limbo and President Donald Trump.

It also comes as many in Illinois are suffering from cabin fever, growing increasingly restless over their lives having been disrupted for more than eight weeks.

For the first time Monday, Pritzker delivered his daily briefing from his home office — a drawing of his late mother behind him — as he broadcast live after a senior staffer tested positive for coronavirus. The governor said he himself has tested negative twice for coronavirus.

The governor also offered some good news along with his bad news projections. After announcing his reopening plan last week that divides the state into four regions and evaluates phases of re-openings based on health metrics, Pritzker said all regions except for the Northeast region “are on pace” to be able to move to the next phase come May 29, the last day of the stay-at-home executive order.

The next phase, Phase 3, allows a number of businesses to reopen, with the use of “face coverings as the norm,” including non-essential manufacturing and some non-essential businesses, including barber shops and salons.

But in the Northeast region, home to Chicago and Cook County, the positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to tests taken — remains too high. Still, the governor signaled there’s still time to get that number lower. His plan in part entails 14 days of a positivity rate under 20%.

In total, 3,459 people have died of coronavirus in Illinois — 803 of them last week. As of Monday, the state also reported 1,266 new cases, bringing the total of positive cases to 79,007. The state received 12,441 tests results.

In late April, Pritzker’s office released a COVID-19 projection and worst-case fatality scenario based on scientific modeling that predicted a range of 50 to 150 deaths per day into early May. That projection was created by researchers from the Illinois Department of Public Health, as well as researchers from Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The latest projection shows Illinois is indeed in a peak period for coronavirus deaths, but it’s less like a peak and more like a plateau.

The death range remains between 50 and 150 a day in models from both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Northwestern University, however, is projecting a range of 50 to 300 daily deaths. The University of Chicago predicts the state seeing a death plateau until July, while both Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are predicting it could last until June.

Beginning on April 23, the state saw 11 days in that originally predicted death range. On May 4, 46 deaths were reported. On May 5, the state saw its worst day with 176 fatalities. And since May 6, the state has consistently seen between 50 and 150 deaths a day, which is what the modelers predicted.

“We haven’t passed our peak yet. We have seen more stability in our numbers, but so far, we are not seeing significant declines in key metrics like hospitalization,” Pritzker said. “The updates to our models reflect that data.”

Pritzker said the time frame of “plateauing near a peak” into mid-May “has been expanded from mid-May into mid-June.”

“In many ways, this news is disheartening,” Pritzker said. “We have made great progress, but it’s forced us to remain at a moderated though still high level of key metrics for this extended period. A pushing out of our estimated peak is a natural consequence of flattening the curve. Remember that no one can truly stop this virus without a vaccine. But what we’ve been aiming to do since early March is slow down the exponential rate of transmission.”

The slowing down, he said, has helped health care workers to treat those with coronavirus and give pharmaceutical researchers time to develop effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine.

“Pushing the peak down and therefore to a longer time frame might not sound like good news to some, but I promise you it is saving lives,” Pritzker said.

The number of COVID-19 patients entering ICU beds went up by 16, from Saturday to Sunday night, according to Pritzker’s office. The number of ventilators being used by coronavirus patients also increased by 21, and the total number of COVID-19 patients increased by 26 patients.

The positivity rate statewide as of Monday is 10.17%. In the Northeast region, which includes Cook County and Chicago, the positivity rate is about 22%.

Meanwhile, Pritzker’s administration said the state has not yet received a shipment of swabs and viral transport media from the federal government. That shipment was anticipated in early May but has not yet arrived. The governor’s administration is also asking for federal help in obtaining surgical gowns, which are going fast, they said.",real

Michigan is the tenth-largest state by population, but it has the third-largest number of deaths resulting from COVID-19. The state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, enacted some of the country’s most stringent stay-at-home orders, even forbidding landscaping and fishing. Furious, and sometimes armed, protesters in Michigan made national news. Meanwhile, Whitmer’s outspoken criticism of the Trump Administration’s efforts on behalf of the states made her a frequent target of the President. “I didn’t ask to be thrown into the national spotlight,” Whitmer tells Susan B. Glasser. “I’m just trying to do my job, and I’m never going to apologize for that. Because lives are at stake here.” Whitmer’s national visibility has brought forward rumors that she is on the short list for Joe Biden’s Vice-Presidential pick. Whitmer is a sexual-assault survivor, and she explains why she stands by Biden despite an accusation made by his former aide Tara Reade.

Glasser also speaks with David Remnick about the tensions that have emerged between the federal government and the states. Although mostly he has targeted Democratic governors, Trump has also criticized some in his own party.",real

Exchanges' physical trading floors have drawn attention during the coronavirus due to the close proximity in which brokers need to work with one another. NYSE temporarily closed its iconic trading floor starting on March 23.

Some have suggested exchanges might choose to remain closed forever, with others saying the markets have operated perfectly fine without them being open. However, NYSE has remained adamant that it would eventually reopen its floor.

Some critical components of NYSE, such as the designated market makers, have adapted to function without the trading floor. However, on Thursday NYSE president Stacey Cunningham announced that the exchange would slowly begin to open its trading floor starting on May 26.

As for Tuchman, he said he hopes to return.

470,11,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/antiviral-developed-using-sugar/,2020-02-04,Antiviral Developed Using Sugar,"Antiviral materials have developed in collaboration by a team of international scientists using sugar that has been designed to destroy viruses on contact which may be useful against viral outbreaks; scientists from the Universities of Manchester, Geneva, and the EPFL in Lausanne are in the early stages of developing the broad spectrum activity of the antiviral material which could also be effective against newly prevalent viral diseases such as the coronavirus.

The new antiviral shows promise for treatment of herpes simplex, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV, hepatitis C, and the Zika virus among others; and it has been demonstrated to be successful in treating a range of viruses in lab studies including genital herpes.

Virucidal substances such as bleach are typically able to destroy viruses on contact but they are toxic to humans, meaning they can’t be taken or applied to the body without causing harm; creating virucides from sugar has allowed for the advent of a new type of antiviral drug that can destroy viruses without being toxic to humans.

Antiviral drugs currently work by inhibiting virus growth, however, they are not always reliable as viruses can mutate and become treatment resistant. As published in the journal Science Advances the team successfully used modified sugar molecules to disrupt the outer shell of a virus thereby destroying the infectious particles on contact, this approach was also shown to defend against drug resistance.

Modified molecules were successfully engineered using natural glucose cyclodextrin derivatives that attract viruses before breaking them down on contact to destroy the virus and fight the infection.

""We have successfully engineered a new molecule, which is a modified sugar that shows broad-spectrum antiviral properties. The antiviral mechanism is virucidal meaning that viruses struggle to develop resistance. As this is a new type of antiviral and one of the first to ever show broad-spectrum efficacy, it has potential to be a game changer in treating viral infections."" said Dr Samuel Jones, from The University of Manchester and a member of the Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, who jointly led the pioneering research with Dr Valeria Cagno from the University of Geneva.

""We developed a powerful molecule able to work against very different viruses, therefore, we think this could be game changing also for emerging infections,” said Professor Caroline Tapparel from the University of Geneva and Prof Francesco Stellacci from EPFL, who were both also senior authors of the study.

This new antiviral molecule has been patented, and a company is currently being set up to continue moving this new development through all of the required processes to get it to real world use. This treatment may make its way to pills, injections, nasal sprays, ointments, and creams for viral infections in the future as it can work to break down multiple viruses making it a cost effective new option even for resistant viruses.",fake

A month ago, Dr. Horacio Arruda was a relatively unknown bureaucrat in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Now, you can find his face on T-shirts, a bread loaf and memes and videos all over social media.

In this age of the coronavirus, Quebec's latest celebrity is a senior health official, who delivers down-to-earth advice in French and English in widely watched daily briefings.

Arruda, a 59-year-old doctor, is the province's director of public health, and his conversational style has charmed Quebecers.

""He's like the dad who's telling you not to panic,"" says Valérie Morency, a children's book illustrator in Montreal. ""He seems very human, very approachable and he explain[s] very well the situation.""

Morency made drawings of Arruda to color in that have been widely shared online.

Catherine Malboeuf-Hurtubise, a psychology professor at Quebec's Bishop's University, explains that Arruda's popularity makes him effective.

""Quebecers are finding him very relatable,"" she says, ""and tend to listen to what he's actually telling us to do.""

In addition to giving hygiene advice, Arruda has suggested activities to cope with self-isolation.

""It could be yoga,"" he suggested in March. ""It could be music. It could be dancing. It could be dancing online with FaceTime, with somebody else. Be innovative.""

When Arruda, whose parents immigrated to Canada from Portugal, shared that he would be making Portuguese tarts, Quebecers started exchanging recipes and baking, too. They posted tart memes to the Facebook page ""Horacio, Our Hero.""

The page's creator, Laurent Deslauriers, says posts have reached more than 2 million people in a province of 8.5 million, and the most-shared items aren't just funny, but also contain useful information.

""We also spread memes that say to wash your hands, to stay home,"" he says.

These messages reach young people who may not watch an entire news conference.

""My friends talk about him all the time,"" 18-year-old Nicolas Schelechow said of Arruda. ""We can have fun, but also it's really crucial information that we need to hear, but it's not said in a tone that everyone gets depressed about.""

Deslauriers says Arruda also represents many public and front-line workers people feel gratitude toward.

""We needed a face. We needed a person,"" he says. ""But we do it for all those working in essential services.""

The psychologist, Malboeuf-Hurtubise, honored Arruda in a different way. Her family recently adopted a cat to lift their spirits in self-isolation. They named her ... ""Horacio.""",real

The coronavirus infection in Russia continues spreading at a dangerous pace. There is no more optimistic scenario for the development of the crisis: the number of positive cases and deaths will continue to grow, while quarantine and restrictive measures will have to be extended.

In the USA, the pandemic progressed from 1,000 to 10,000 positive cases within 6 days; in Germany, Italy and Spain - eight days, in Austria - 15 days, and in Russia - 12 days. Five countries have already passed the mark of 100,000 patients within 15 or18 days.



Irresponsibility of citizens, especially young people who mistakenly believe that they are out of risk, makes preventive measures for the spread of the infection a lot less effective. The virus can affect anyone regardless of age. Moreover, nothing is known about the consequences that Covid-19 may cause for the human body. It may decrease physical stamina and change psychological peculiarities.



Tatyana Golikova, the Vice Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, believes that Russia is not going to be able to lift restrictions by May holidays.

""We do want to get out of this crisis on the eve of such a great holiday as Victory Day, but

we definitely won't be able to extricate from the crisis,"" she said.

In order to assess the situation, one needs to live through two cycles of 14 days in an epidemic (the average duration of the incubation period of the coronavirus). The first cycle is ending early this week, when specialists can say whether the situation with the spread of the virus has reached a plateau or continues to grow.



For the time being, the crisis continues to aggravate. Every days brings new records:

as many as 2,558 cases of new infection were confirmed in Russia within the last 24 hours

the number of positive cases of the infection grows in Russia by 25-30 percent

as of April 13, a total of 18,328 cases were registered in 82 regions in the country.

Russian authorities lose time

The Moscow authorities were forced to switch to stringent measures after they chose to start with soft restrictions two weeks ago. During this time, the number of infected people in Russia grew from 1,000 to 18,000.



Leading Russian economists earlier warned that non-working days without travel and social communication restrictions would be perceived as an unexpected holiday. Indeed, many chose to go to their dachas, others flocked to parks and other places of mass congregation of people.

A similar mistake was made a month before in Italy and led to disastrous consequences. Soft quarantine and non-working days led to an increase in morbidity rate. Italy declared strict quarantine, but it was too late.

Since last Monday, the number of infected people has doubled, while the infection rate has tripled. More than 11,500 coronavirus-positive patients are being treated at Moscow hospitals.

In late March, Muscovites were outraged by the ""draconian measures,"" which Mayor Sergei Sobyanin introduced in the city. Presently, it has become clear to everyone that the crisis in Moscow is rapidly developing according to scenarios of Italy or New York.

The scale of the disaster became obvious after the Ministry of Health allowed the diagnosis of coronavirus without tests, but only by CT, just based on symptoms, as was the case in the beginning of winter in China.",fake

The Dearborn Truck Plant, where Ford assembles the F-150 and Raptor pickups, halted production Wednesday after an employee there tested positive for the virus, Kelli Felker, Ford's global manufacturing and labor communications manager, said in a statement. Production is expected to resume Wednesday night.

""When a Dearborn Truck Plant employee who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately began to notify people known to have been in close contact with the infected individual and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,"" Felker said. ""We are deep cleaning and disinfecting the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.""

In Chicago, two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for the virus. The same protocols were applied in those cases, and Chicago Assembly now is running again. Due to the known incubation time of the virus, Ford said ""we know (these employees) did not contract COVID-19 while at work.""

The cases illustrate the potential perils of restarting production amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Michigan. Autoworkers employed by Detroit's automakers returned to work Monday following an eight-week shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At facilities operated by all three companies, employees must follow stringent health and safety protocols that are designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in plants. Those protocols include wearing personal protective equipment, having their temperatures checked before entering, and daily health self-certifications.

While COVID-19 testing is not available to the entire workforce of any of the automakers, all are making testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms of the virus or who believe they have been exposed to it. Ford, for example, has contracts with health systems in major metro areas where it operates. In southeast Michigan, the Blue Oval is partnering with Beaumont Health on testing.

General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Wednesday they have not been forced to stop production at their plants. Starting and stopping production is costly and something automakers would prefer to avoid — except for potential health and safety concerns.

Monday's resumption of production was the first time that the entire global automotive supply chain and major automakers all came back online at once, posing a major test to the industry. After a two-month shutdown in which the automakers bled billions of dollars, the goal has been to make the restart process as smooth as possible.

The move follows a similar policy announced last week by Twitter, the other San Francisco firm led by CEO Jack Dorsey. The social media company told workers they could do their jobs remotely “forever” if they wished and their positions allowed for it.

Shelter-in-place orders from the pandemic have led many Bay Area companies to consider extending work-from-home policies beyond the pandemic, and several have told this news organization they plan to continue allowing remote work after it’s safe to return to offices. Google earlier this month said it was extending its work-from-home policy to the end of the year from June. Facebook has said it plans to re-open offices July 6 but will let employees work from outside offices through the end of 2020.

Square said it didn’t have a timeline for opening offices, but that the bulk of its full-time employees would be able to work remotely after offices open. News of Square’s policy was first reported by tech website The Verge.

Ron DeSantis: Florida ‘lifting all restrictions on youth activities’

This includes summer camps.

School may be out, but summer camp is back in.

Tampa Bay May 22, 2020:

Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday that he was ending all restrictions on youth activities across the state, including camps and youth sports. The declaration was the governor’s latest move to wake Florida from its coronavirus-induced economic slumber.

However, the Republican governor said he would not prevent municipalities from imposing more restrictive rules.

“We believe that this makes sense based on the data and observed experience. We are not going to be instituting a lot of rules, or really any rules,” DeSantis said Friday, noting the Florida Department of Health would likely post a list of best practices to its website. “At the end of the day, we trust parents to be able to make decisions in conjunction with physicians.”

DeSantis’ announcement, which came at a news conference in Jacksonville, dovetailed with the plans of some Tampa Bay area officials, and conflicted with others.

Last week, Hillsborough County’s Department of Parks and Recreation cancelled its series of summer camps.

Hillsborough Commission Chairman Les Miller Jr. said the county was awaiting the official executive order from the governor’s office before deciding its next step. As of late Friday, DeSantis’ office had yet to post the executive order. Miller said county officials would follow the order. Pinellas officials said Friday they have a similar plan.

Miller, however, noted it could be difficult for Hillsborough to open its camps with additional potential restrictions such as social distancing, limited group sizes or masks.

“We’d have to put a lot of things in place before we open up the gates and say, “Come on in,’” said Miller.

On Thursday, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor announced the city was opening its summer camps starting June 1.

“We’re continuing ahead with our summer school because people can’t get back to work if they don’t have some type of care for their children,” Mayor Jane Castor said on a Cafe Con Tampa Facebook live stream Friday. “And so we realized that and we’re going to open up our summer camps.”

Ashley Bauman, Castor’s spokeswoman, said DeSantis’ announcement had little to do with the city’s plans to reopen summer camps because the city considers camps to be child care. That type of care was never banned under the governor’s previous restrictions, Bauman said.

Later Friday, Castor said in a statement she would “wholeheartedly support” the governor’s decision to reopen youth sports, provided it was done safely.

St. Petersburg announced last week that its summer camps will proceed at a limited capacity.

A spokeswoman for YMCA of the Suncoast and the Tampa Metropolitan Area YMCA said the organizations would wait until the full executive order had been released to comment.

DeSantis contended that youth activities — schools, most notably — were closed in the first place because, in the early days of the pandemic, it was believed children would spread the disease to other, more vulnerable populations.

But children haven’t turned out to be very effective spreaders of the illness, the governor argued Friday.

“The data is pretty clear that, for whatever reason, kids don’t seem to get infected at the same rates that some other adults get infected,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis also noted that children are much less likely to face serious consequences from the novel coronavirus. In Florida, five in six coronavirus deaths have come from people 65 and over. Zero people under 25 have died from the disease, DeSantis no

Some analysts warn that it could take years to return to the 3.5-percent unemployment rate the nation recorded in February. Economists compare the effects of COVID-19 on the economy to the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Depression of the 1930s, even though some argue that it won't be as damaging and long-lasting.

The articles with headlines such as ""Trump's choice: an economy or human lives"" or statements such as those of N.Y. governor Andrew Cuomo — ""What government does today will literally determine how many people live and how many people die,"" ""If it's public health versus the economy, the only choice is public health"" — demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of not just the economic laws, but the crucial and truly deadly effect of unemployment on people's health. But before we get to this subject in more detail, let me mention one more symbolic article that describes all those tens of millions of ordinary Americans who found themselves wiping out a decade of employment gains in a single month and striving to get back to work as a ""murderous, terrorist movement."" In the article ""It's not a death cult, it's a mass murder movement,"" Tim Wise argues that ""the MAGA nation"" is a cabal of hateful, ignorant, anti-social eugenicists intent on removing those they deem inferior from society by slashing safety nets, building walls against immigrants [sic], or by letting disease kill hundreds of thousands of people whose lives ""they never valued anyway.""

There is nothing new in this hateful smearing of ordinary people by the left. Indeed, the elitist celebrities, commentators, and politicians living their luxurious lives tend to attribute to us ""deplorables"" such qualities as arrogance, ignorance, and outright stupidity (plus all the negative -isms out there). Now the redneck murderers ""downplay the deadly pandemic"" in favor of returning to work. Why is it so important to work, anyway?

The issue of unemployment and its micro and macro effects on society is broadly and globally researched in many disciplines of knowledge — economics, philosophy, sociology, psychology, psychiatry, political science, criminology. The conclusions are unequivocal — unemployment is much more of a deadly phenomenon than any virus. Unemployment destroys lives and the mental and physical health of individuals and leads to higher suicide and crime rates, as well as poverty-related diseases. It may cause civil unrest and disorder, catalyzing destructive processes within societies. Furthermore, mass and chronic unemployment results in or accompanies the development of undemocratic regimes that neglect and abuse individual rights and freedoms ""for the greater good,"" which legitimizes their absolute power. How do you count the victims of those?

There are obvious reasons for the importance of the employment for individuals — for most people, basic life requirements are met through their work. 'Cause we are living in a material world — aren't we, Madonna? — we satisfy our physiological needs by means of money that we make by performing publicly useful jobs. We bring food to the table, pay bills and mortgages, travel and get an education — maintain some decent standard of living. Income losses might force the unemployed to reduce their living standards drastically, which could influence both the physical and mental health of the unemployed, according to the Journal of Human Resources. Perhaps the simplest example would be substitution of a healthy and more expensive diet in favor of cheap and low-quality fast food. But even if there is no material deprivation, being unemployed could lead to anxiety about the length of income loss and the risk of a future drop in standard of living. Related to this anxiety is the possibility that joblessness can generate ""a feeling that life is not under one's control."" Employed workers may feel insecurity to some degree, particularly temporary workers. ""Those who are economically insecure, employed or unemployed have a lower morale,"" because certainly work is much more than just a way of providing for material needs. It also fulfills creativity and inventiveness, promotes self-esteem, and provides an avenue for achievement and self-realization.

Unemployment also creates stress by disturbing such important psychological elements as personal identity, time structuring, and self-esteem. It may also disrupt social support networks through the loss of social relationships at work, the abandonment of hobbies and social life under financial pressure, and withdrawal from social interaction because of the stigma of being jobless.

When people lose their jobs, their stress can manifest physically as well. These physical manifestations may be mild to severe. One might experience headache, muscle tension or pain, chest pain, fatigue, decrease of sex drive, and sleep problems. For many who are experiencing these effects, they are often not taking all the precautions to prevent these effects from happening. They may not be engaging in any physical activity or eating healthfully, which can result in more severe health effects. Scientists suggest that there are physical health concerns that accompany job loss such as increases in cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone, and cholesterol and decreased immune reactions. These physical issues can result in illness, which in turn creates a bigger need for health care and additional pressure on the health care system. It is examined that for every 1-percent rise in unemployment, deaths from heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and stress-related disorders increase 1.9 percent. Research conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that people who lost their jobs developed new medical concerns such has increased blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease compared to those who were continually employed. Of those who were laid off, 10 percent of the participants developed health issues regardless of if they found new employment.

Not only does unemployment affect the person experiencing unemployment, but it can also affect the family unit. Children of an unemployed person have been found to experience digestive problems, irritability, and delayed physical and mental development. It has been explored that this may be due to the parent neglecting his parental duties, often due to depression.

Also, please consider the toll unemployment takes on violent crime rates. A one-percent increase in the unemployment rate will increase the violent crime rate by 14.3 per 100,000 inhabitants, as suggested by the study of 2015. Don't Chicago, Baltimore, and Detroit demonstrate the correlation?

All in all, the evidence shows that unemployment has a grievous effect on both individual and societal health. Reopening America may not be reduced to the ""you want you kill your grandma"" and ""your haircut is not worth somebody's life"" arguments. The economy is not just some mythological creature the left evidently has little to no knowledge about. It is a fundament of living and of the lives of Americans.

This does not mean that businesses should not take all necessary percussions to decrease health risks for their employees. After all, essential businesses have demonstrated that it can be done — why not acknowledge that ""non-essential"" ones can follow the lead? We need to reopen to save, not to lose, lives.

J.B. Pritzker has repeatedly said he’s delegating enforcement of his stay-at-home order to local governments.

That stance has frustrated some folks who want him to get tougher with violators (although he’d undoubtedly risk making martyrs out of them if he did crack down hard). And the governor’s position seems to have emboldened some local officials to defy the governor’s executive order and open up their economies on their own.

But when local governments refuse to enforce the governor’s order, it appears that trial lawyers might step in and insurance companies might take a walk.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

A growing number of Downstate sheriffs, state’s attorneys and other officials have declared they won’t be enforcing the governor’s stay-at-home order. The Woodford County state’s attorney has said he won’t prosecute violators, as has the White County state’s attorney. Johnson County’s sheriff is one of several who’ve said he also wouldn’t arrest anyone for violating the order.

East Peoria’s mayor has gone beyond even that, officially allowing the “opening” of several businesses in his city on May 1 that were ordered closed by the governor’s executive order, including hair salons, spas, gyms and indoor recreational facilities. On May 15, bars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, and churches and theaters also will be allowed to reopen on that date.

But the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association has a message for those renegade municipalities and businesses preparing to throw open their doors: Watch out for lawsuits.

“The risk of opening early outweighs the benefit of limiting liability not only for the municipality but also for any employer who follows the guidelines of the municipality,” said ITLA President Antonio Romanucci in a written statement. “The prudent course would be to stay closed for another 25 days and limit any further potential spread which could lead to litigation.”

I asked Pritzker at a recent press conference what he thought of the warning from trial lawyers.

“Well, I was a businessman before I became governor,” Pritzker replied, “and I have to tell you that I would not want to defy the executive order because I believe that I would be taking on liability if I did that.”

Those towns and businesses could find themselves without insurance coverage should something go wrong.

Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told me that insurance policies are “not going to cover intentional acts.” In other words, if a business intentionally reopens in violation of the executive order and somebody injures himself at the establishment or contracts the virus, insurance coverage won’t be a given. The same may go for municipalities that openly violate the executive order.

The Illinois Department of Insurance also chimed in, saying via press release: “If businesses reopen contrary to public health guidelines and the state’s executive orders, there is risk that an insurer could find reason within the policy language to deny COVID-19 related claims.”

I asked Pritzker at that same press about insurance issues.

“It would not surprise me if insurance companies are found to not be required to cover you when you are defying essentially state law or a state executive order,” he replied.

The Illinois Retail Merchants Association has taken the position from the beginning that the executive order is “the best course of action for both consumers and employees,” the group’s president, Rob Karr, said via written statement. “We have also advised retailers of both the liability, insurance and other legal issues that may arise from not following the state’s guidance.”

The Illinois Restaurant Association also released a statement saying the group has encouraged its members to follow the executive order. The Illinois Licensed Beverage Association, which represents tavern owners, said it “does not advise” its members to violate the executive order.

The governor has pointed out several times that many of the businesses that are defiantly reopening have state licenses. Your local barber or salon owner needs a state license to open and operate. Cosmetologists, electrologists, massage therapists and nail technicians are just some of the others who must have state licenses. Restaurants and taverns are under state oversight and can be closed down by local public health departments in situations just like this.

The bottom line is, if you don’t fear the virus, then you might want to start to fear being wiped out by lawsuits not covered by insurance or losing your license.

For Harris, 58, this is only the latest attempt for a release. For decades, he has been incarcerated in federal and state prison for various convictions related to a massive international cocaine trafficking he built in the 1980s, which at its peak generated an estimated $2 million per day. But unlike many in his situation, Harris has the backing not just of justice reform advocates, but law enforcement members and elected officials, who have lobbied for his freedom in recent years.

Harris is currently incarcerated in Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc, where his federal sentence is set to end in October 2028. It is a prison complex that has gained national notoriety for its failure to contain COVID-19; with more than 1,700 cases and 10 fatalities, the prison was recently sued by the ACLU over its handling of the pandemic.

According to court filings by Harris’ legal team, Harris is afflicted with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disease where the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, which can lead to full-blown paralysis. This, combined with the coronavirus outbreak, adds up to an “imminent threat” to Harris’ health if he is not released, his attorneys argued.

“If Mr. Harris were to become critically ill or die while in custody, it would be not only devastating from a human standpoint for Mr. Harris and his family, but would eliminate a person who, following his release, would in all probability serve as a great source of healing and mentoring in the disadvantaged community of South Central Los Angeles in which he was raised,” Harris’ attorneys, Matthew Lombard and Bruce Zucker, wrote in a motion for compassionate release.

On top of that, Harris’ motion argues that the U.S. Marshal service miscalculated Harris’ federal sentence when he was sentenced to federal and state terms in the early 90s, and that Harris would be a free man today if not for their mistake.

In its response, the U.S. Attorney’s office argues on technical legal terms that Harris should be ineligible for a judge-ordered compassionate release because he still has a pending administrative appeal for release. They also argue that staff at Lompoc have taken “aggressive” measures to reduce the further spread of COVID-19 in the facility, including testing the entire inmate population.

“None of (Harris’) arguments, including those related to COVID-19, justify a permanent, irrevocable reduction in his sentence,” assistant U.S. Attorneys with the Central District of California wrote in a response motion. They later added that, ” Many of the defendant’s allegations are based on his mischaracterization of the record and downplaying his material involvement in drug trafficking activities.”

It was unclear when a judge will rule on the motion. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. ordered Harris’ attorneys to file a 20-page reply to the federal government’s response by May 22, according to court records.

The coronavirus outbreak in the Lompoc prison complex — which comprises two federal prisons — is widely considered the worst of any federal jail or prison, nationwide. Its number of confirmed cases has grown exponentially, nearly doubling from May 11 to May 17, according to published reports.

At FCI Lompoc, where Harris stays, roughly 80 percent of the 1,162 inmates have tested positive for the virus. There have been 10 fatalities.

Late last week, the ACLU filed a class-action suit on behalf of Lompoc inmates, accusing the prison of “deliberate indifference” to stopping the spread of the virus. The Bureau of Prisons has not publicly responded to the suit.

Harris’ career and public persona

Harris is famous for financing the start of Death Row Records in the early 1990s, investing $1.5 million in a partnership with the label’s co-founder Marion “Suge” Knight. The two formed a parent company for Death Row Records known as Godfather Entertainment, but business disputes between Knight and Harris ultimately curbed the partnership. In the 1990s, Death Row Records produced numerous classic rap albums, including Snoop Doggy’s Doggystyle and 2pac’s best-selling record during his life, All Eyez on Me.

Harris also co-founded the Houston-based Rap-a-Lot Records, and funded the Broadway play Checkmates, starring Denzel Washington.

In the late 1980s, Harris was convicted of attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in state court. He was also convicted in federal court of conspiring with members of the notorious Columbian-based Cali Cartel to distribute cocaine throughout the United States, earning a reputation as the king of Los Angeles’ cocaine rackets.

Over his decades in prison, though, Harris gained a different kind of notability; he formed the nonprofit Richmond Project, aimed at diverting youth in West Contra Costa away from crime. He became editor-in-chief of the San Quentin News and is credited with bringing the award-winning newspaper back from the brink.

“Being a drug dealer is what Michael Harris did, not who he is,” his attorneys wrote in the compassionate release motion, later adding: “During his time as a drug dealer, he has said, he had grown physically as a male, but he acted in immature boyish ways, to the detriment of himself, his family, and countless others. After more than three decades in prison, when he leaves, he will be a senior citizen, but also he will leave as a morally mature man.”

Harris has publicly apologized for the cocaine dealing of his past numerous times, and maintained his innocence in his state charges. His attorneys wrote that the purported victim of Harris’ conspiracy to commit murder conviction has since admitted his testimony was “perjured” and that Harris was innocent of his state charges. He was paroled from state prison in 2011, and immediately picked up by the U.S. Marshals and taken to Lompoc.

Harris has also gained the support of numerous public officials — including former Obama advisor Van Jones — as well as politicians like State Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, and Contra Costa Supervisor John Gioia. Former Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus even wrote a letter advocating for Harris to be released from prison, in which Magnus described Harris as a “rare and valuable” person whose influence was “badly needed” in the Richmond community.

Last August, a federal judge denied Harris’ appeal for an early release under early release under Amendment 782, an Obama-era law that changed sentencing guidelines for federal drug convictions. It was widely — and inaccurately — reported at the time that Harris had been granted his freedom.",real

An error in this week's US weekly jobless claims report shows the importance of revisions.

Eagle-eyed observers noticed it almost right away — Thursday's weekly US jobless claims report stated that Connecticut had 298,680 claims for the week ending May 9.

It stood out for a few reasons. The first is that Connecticut had 36,138 claims in the prior week, meaning that Thursday's number was a whopping 726% increase in just seven days.

The second is that it put Connecticut at the top of the chart — the Thursday number was the highest in the nation, beating out other larger states such as New York, California, and Pennsylvania.

548,7,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/natural-ways-combat-flu-virus-symptoms/,2020-01-29,Natural Ways To Combat Flu Virus Symptoms,"Influenza is caused by a virus, and there are several kinds that can give you the flu. While there is no cure for the flu, there are ways both pharmaceutically and gentler more natural approaches to help soothe flu symptoms that may help to shorten how long you are sick.

It is very important to drink plenty of water and other fluids, especially when you are not well to help your body loosen and get rid of built up mucus and phlegm to clear away. It is also very easy to get dehydrated when you are not feeling well and are not drinking or eating normally. In addition, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause water loss.

To help your body stay hydrated other than drinking water you can also drink coconut water, herbal teas, fresh juice, soups, broths, and consume fresh fruits and vegetables. You will be able to tell if you are drinking enough liquids if you have to urinate frequently, and the colour of your urine is pale yellow or clear. If your urine is deep yellow to amber you may be dehydrated.

If you are a smoker it may be best to refrain from the habit while you are ill as much as possible because it can further irritate your nose, throat, and lungs.

It is also important to get more sleep when you are sick because sleeping helps to boost the immune system which will help your body fight off the virus. If you have plans it is best to cancel those to avoid spreading the virus and to make sleep a priority to help your body get back on your feet.

Warm chicken or beef bone broth is also good to consume to help stay hydrated, it will help to loosen and break up nose/sinus congestion. Bone broth is an excellent source of natural minerals such as potassium and sodium as well as replenishing other nutrients and protein that are important to rebuilding immune cells while you are sick.

Zinc is important for the immune system, it helps the body make germ fighting white blood cells, and research suggests that it may help to ease cold and flu symptoms as well as help the body fight the virus while slowing down how fast it multiplies. Zinc can be supplemented or obtained through diet in sources such as red meat, shellfish, lentils, beans, eggs, dairy, lentils, chickpeas, nuts and seeds.

A salt water gargle can help to soothe a sore throat and clear mucus. Boil water and let cool until at room temperature, add ½ teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water and gargle at the back of your throat for at least 10-30 seconds to rinse your mouth and throat. Spit out into sink and repeat 2-4 times. Please don’t swallow the salt water, and don’t use on children, they can safely gargle with plain water.

Many herbs carry natural antiviral and antibacterial properties that can help while you are sick. Star anise is the star shaped spice that oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was extracted from traditionally. This has antiviral properties that can be effective against some strains of the flu virus. Other herbs that may help can be brewed into hot herbal green/black teas to help soothe symptoms to mix with star anise include turmeric, ginger, garlic, and cloves. If you would like some sweetness try using honey rather than sugar, for best results try royal jelly which has been shown to have natural antibacterial and antiviral properties. Some natural health stores may even have bagged teas with all of these ingredients already combined together.

Essential oils may help to protect you against certain bacteria and viruses. Tea tree oil has been shown to help combat flu viruses by slowing or stopping the rate at which the virus multiplies; research suggests it works best when used within 2 hours of infection. Adding a few drops of this essential oil to hand soap or lotions can help to stop spread at a common source, and some mouthwashes also include tea tree oil as an ingredient.

Other essential oils and plants that also have natural antivirals and antibiotics include cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, geranium oil, lemon oil, thyme oil, and oregano oil. Be sure to use these oils only as directed, and do not ingest essential oil as many are toxic. Most can be used on the skin after being diluted with a carrier oil such as coconut, olive, or almond oil. Fresh dried herbs and spices can also be added to the mixtures for added benefits.

Essential oils diffused into the air may also help against some strains of viruses and bacteria. However, it is not advised to use this kind of aromatherapy on children, pets, while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.

Flu viruses prefer dry indoor air in which they can survive longer, and spread more easily. Colder outdoor temperatures typically lower humidity, as such using a humidifier in your home and workplace may help to reduce flu viruses in the air.

Steam inhalation therapy uses hot water vapor to help loosen mucus congestion which may help to relieve swelling in the nose/lungs, as well as soothe a dry cough, irritated nose, and chest tightness. It is best to avoid steam from water while it is boiling, and test the temperature before breathing it in to avoid scalding or burning yourself. You can even add a few drops of essential oils or medicated vapor rub to the hot water for added antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral benefits.

Having a flu that is affecting your stomach is difficult as it can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. During this time only eat small hand sized portions of food at a time, and stick to bland foods that are easier to digest such as bananas, rice, toast, applesauce, crackers, soup, broth, and boiled potatoes. Try to avoid any food that may irritate your stomach and digestion such as caffeine, milk, cheese, spicy food, fatty food, fried foods, and alcohol.

Most flu viruses will typically cause respiratory symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body aches, runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, dry cough, tiredness, fatigue. Stomach flu viruses cause digestive symptoms such as chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps.

Sometimes flu viruses can lead to other health complications by triggering other viral or bacterial infections in the ears, lungs, throat and other areas to promote sinusitis, ear infections, encephalitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Those who are at an increased risk for such complications include those with other health conditions, adults over the age of 65, and children who are under the age of 5.

If you are sick with a flu virus it might be best to speak with a doctor if you have a chronic condition such as asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, heart disease, stroke, or a lung condition.

If you have a fever over 100.4°F/38°C you should see a doctor, and you should seek medical attention if your symptoms are not improving after two weeks. Be sure to see a doctor if you are having trouble breathing, chest pains, chills or sweating, mucus that is an odd colour, blood in mucous, severe cough, or high fever.

Viruses can cause both cold and flu, both infections will give you a fever, and both have similar symptoms the main difference is how bad the symptoms are and how long they last. Flu symptoms are typically sudden and severe, lasting 1-2 weeks. Cold symptoms are generally milder lasting for one week or longer.

Most cases of the flu will not require medical attention, if you are sick, please stay home and rest so that you don’t spread it to other people at work/school. Home remedies can help to reduce symptoms to make you more comfortable and rest more while you are ill, and the rest will have an enormous influence on how quickly you get better.

Quick tip from Dr. Klatz with the scare of this novel coronavirus spreading to boost your immune system make sure that you are getting enough vitamins C and D, as well as selenium, garlic, and liquid iodine to help fight off any cold or flu viruses looking to set up camp in your body.

Those include: a link to the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) online COVID-19 symptom checker, a suggestion to talk to a healthcare provider if you think you should be tested, a link to COVID-19 testing information from your local health authorities, and a note that you may need to call ahead to a testing center to make sure you can actually get a test.

You won’t see listings for testing centers in Connecticut, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon and Pennsylvania

The Testing tab will also show you information about specific testing centers unless you’re in Connecticut, Maine, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon or Pennsylvania, Google tells The Verge. That’s because Google is only surfacing testing locations that have been approved for publishing by health authorities, the company says. For the same reason, Google is only listing a single testing center located in Albany for the state of New York, but the company expects to add more New York listings soon.

Here’s what the results look like for me. I’m writing this from Portland, OR, so the results don’t list testing centers near me.

COVID-19 testing criteria and availability vary based on where you live, which is why Google is pointing toward local information with these resources. The testing information comes from “government agencies, public health departments, or directly from healthcare institutions,” according to a Google support document.

Google launched a COVID-19 website with information and resources about the pandemic on March 21st. Google’s sister company Verily also offers free COVID-19 tests to people in parts of California, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania if they qualify after taking an online screening.

Google isn’t the only company working to make it easier to find COVID-19 testing information. Last weekend, Apple launched a website so healthcare providers and labs that offer COVID-19 testing can submit their information and appear in Apple Maps search results as testing sites.",real

Pritzker fails to plan for Illinois recovery after pandemic — and residents panic,"Illinois has seen a record number of residents file for unemployment in recent weeks. Workers are being furloughed or losing their jobs altogether. Families are worried about making rent and feeding their kids.

As we work together to contain the spread of COVID-19, we must also have an open and active conversation about ensuring Illinois’ economic recovery is as strong as possible. That means establishing a process and timeline to safely and effectively open the economy, so we are not only protecting lives but also safeguarding livelihoods.

Opinion

Gov. J.B. Pritzker has failed to address Illinois’ broken unemployment system, which has been unable to deliver benefits to people desperate for a lifeline. He has been incapable of cutting through the confusion facing small business owners, gig workers, independent contractors and sole proprietors about the status of their benefits. And on Sunday, after the nation’s top infectious disease expert said some sectors of the economy might be able to start reopening in May, Pritzker finally hinted that the state is thinking about — just thinking about — how to safely get key sectors back online, but that remains a closed conversation.

The uncertainty created by Pritzker’s lack of leadership on these issues is making residents panic. We are hearing from them daily.

We heard from a Morton husband and wife team staring down $46,000 in property tax payments as their tenants can’t make rent.

We heard from an Eldorado trucker who saw his paycheck cut in half, and who wants the progressive income tax hike removed from the ballot for fear it will drive his customers out of state.

We heard from a new Chicago restaurant owner in the South Loop, who started a change.org petition that calls on the governor to fix a loophole in the small business loan program.

Pritzker has said repeatedly that he cannot count on the White House, but he isn’t offering details on recovery solutions of his own. He should follow the example of other states, such as Utah, where state and local governments are putting together their own plans to navigate reopening the economy without prompting a second-wave outbreak. Or the example of New York, which reached out to Google to fix their unemployment system so new federal benefits could reach self-employed workers.

My organization, the Illinois Policy Institute, is the strongest taxpayer advocate network in Illinois. I am proud that we have been able to use our megaphone to make sure the people of Illinois are seen and heard by state and local lawmakers, and we’ve fostered conversations within our community as to what should happen next.

Those conversations are open-minded and productive. The same is not true in Springfield, where so far the only specifics residents have heard in the way of economic problem-solving is pointing the finger at the federal government. In a crisis, strong leaders prove themselves by stepping up and taking action. My organization has commended Pritzker on his efforts to contain the spread of the virus when it was warranted — we understand that public health and people’s lives must always come first.

But we hear almost every day from people struggling to make ends meet, with no money coming in this month or last, and no idea when they’ll be able to work again. So we decided to open up a conversation, asking people what they think and what they’d like their leaders to do.

Instead of offering help to the Illinoisans we highlighted, a spokesperson for the governor proceeded to attack us for providing them a forum.

That is not leadership.

Gov. Pritzker: Uncertainty is the enemy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a trying and unprecedented time, but that does not excuse defensive leadership that shifts blame. Accountability and openness are needed from those in whom the people have placed their trust — and to be specific, that means public confidence rises when Illinoisans see you and your team are open to ideas and working on a plan and a timeline to get the state back to work.

The complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.

Monday’s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Madison, the capital, said tens of thousands of voters were disenfranchised after they “encountered obstacles at almost every stage of the election process,” including crowded poll places and thousands of absentee ballots that were either not delivered or arrived too late.

The burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.

A spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.

Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state’s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.

The two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November’s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.

Many of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters’ rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party’s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states

Republicans have argued that loosening restrictions could increase the potential for voter fraud, though examples in the United States are exceedingly rare. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has echoed those arguments, saying without evidence that mail-in voting is rampant with fraud.",real
566,692,https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-coronavirus-cash-pledge-questions-remain/,2020-05-08,Paris yet to provide details of cash pledge for coronavirus fight,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
568,151,https://chicago.suntimes.com/soccer/2020/3/25/21194015/coronavirus-covid-19-champions-league-italy-atalanta-valencia,2020-03-25,Champions League match linked to spread of coronavirus in Italy,"ROME — It was the biggest soccer game in Atalanta’s history and a third of Bergamo’s population made the short trip to Milan’s famed San Siro Stadium.

Nearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match.

More than a month later, experts are pointing to the Feb. 19 game as one of the biggest reasons why Bergamo has become one of the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic — a “biological bomb” was the way one respiratory specialist put it — and why 35% of Valencia’s team became infected.

The match, which local media have dubbed “Game Zero,” was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was confirmed in Italy.

“We were mid-February so we didn’t have the circumstances of what was happening,” Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori said this week during a live Facebook chat with the Foreign Press Association in Rome. “If it’s true what they’re saying that the virus was already circulating in Europe in January, then it’s very probable that 40,000 Bergamaschi in the stands of San Siro, all together, exchanged the virus between them. As is possible that so many Bergamaschi that night got together in houses, bars to watch the match and did the same.

“Unfortunately, we couldn’t have known. No one knew the virus was already here,” the mayor added. “It was inevitable.”

Less than a week after the game, the first cases were reported in the province of Bergamo.

At about the same time in Valencia, a journalist who traveled to the match became the second person infected in the region, and it didn’t take long before people who were in contact with him also had the virus, as did Valencia fans who were at the game.

While Atalanta announced its first positive case Tuesday for goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, Valencia said more than a third of its squad got infected, “despite the strict measures adopted by the club” after the match in Milan.

As of Tuesday, nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus — making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic. The Valencia region had more than 2,600 people infected.

Luca Lorini, the head of the intensive care unit at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, currently has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus; not including many more in other parts of the hospital.

“I’m sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart — four times, because Atalanta scored four goals (the final result was 4-1) — was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion,” Lorini told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

“Right now we’re at war. When peace time comes, I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected,” Lorini added. “Right now we have other priorities.”

Silvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy’s Superior Institute of Health, said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was “one of the hypotheses” being evaluated as a source of the crisis in Bergamo.

“It’s certainly an analysis that can be made,” Brusaferro said.

By last week, Bergamo’s cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation.

Italy remained the European country with the most cases, nearly 70,000, and with almost 7,000 deaths — the most worldwide and more than twice as many as China.

Spain is the next country in Europe with the most cases, nearly 48,000, and it has surpassed China in the number of deaths with more than 3,400.

More than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 100,000 have recovered.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 — a “home” record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe’s top club competition.

Atalanta captain Alejandro “Papu” Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was “terrible” to have played that game.

“It’s a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro,” the Argentine said. “It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes.”

The game was played in Milan because Atalanta’s stadium in Bergamo didn’t meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.

Before the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city’s plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.

Looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern — at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn’t yet known — and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.

The evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.

“I have heard a lot (of theories), I’ll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia,” Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. “In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately.”

Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.

Italian soccer players’ association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.

“Look at what’s happening in China, where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now — despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken,” Tommasi told the AP, referring to a recent positive test for former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with Chinese club Shandong Lunen.

Fellaini’s positive test was alarming because, while the outbreak began spreading in China, the virus has reportedly been receding there.

“It’s not going to be enough to just test the athletes,” Tommasi added. “The entire setting needs to be safe. Because if one team is stuck, it blocks the entire system.”

After winning the first leg, Atalanta advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on March 10, which was played in an empty Mestalla Stadium in Valencia after Spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern Italy to be played with fans. A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants.

Over the past month, Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19.

Still, only one positive test from Atalanta has been announced.

“Some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,” Tommasi said. “Other squads tested everyone. These are individual choices.

“The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. … The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder.”

With the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic, Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals — which again would be the club’s biggest game in its history. In the meantime, both the Bergamo team and Valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in February.",real

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that schools and colleges in the state will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.

Schools will continue virtual learning for the remainder of the year, and a decision about whether summer schools will be able to open with students on the premises will be made by the end of the month, Cuomo said in his daily coronavirus update from Albany.

Schools will also need to plan for how to reopen under social-distancing guidelines in the fall or in 2021.

""We don't think it's possible to reopen schools in a way that would keep our children and students and educators safe,"" Cuomo said.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on April 11 schools in the city would remain closed for the rest of the year. Later that day, Cuomo pushed back, saying that shutting schools is ""my legal authority,"" and should be coordinated regionally across Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York City and its surrounding counties.

New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza told principals in a conference call earlier this week that while the city is preparing to open schools in September, there's only a ""50-50 shot"" the buildings will actually open then, according to The New York Post.

Cuomo added that a decision on whether to extend the ""NY Pause"" business closures beyond May 15 will be made before that deadline, but did not give a more specific timeframe.

The 6-foot-4, 300-pound rising senior has stumbled a few times in college sports’ version of Weight Watchers, with no in-person classes or spring practices.

“Maybe I would get Taco Bell because I do like Taco Bell,” Brown said. “Or maybe I’ll have ice cream later at night. … The meals that are maybe not super-nutritious, I’ve been trying to keep that to one a day.”

Athletes have been displaced from facilities with well-stocked training tables and easy access to healthy snacks and protein shakes. Some are home with family members, while others are largely on their own in off-campus residences.

To help them, schools have provided care packages, grocery tips, recipes and even cooking demonstrations on social media. And nutritionists or dietitians at schools — there are 96 with at least one on staff, according to the College and Professional Sports Dietitians Association, with roughly two-thirds in the Power Five conferences — have consulted with athletes from afar.

The challenge is keeping athletes — already engaged in makeshift workout regimens — on track when it comes to adding strength or avoiding unwanted pounds, even as it remains unclear when they can return to campuses or whether they’ll play this fall as the country tries to reopen.

“For some of them, it’s really good that they’re home, because they do have someone that’s still making home-cooked meals for them,” said Rachel Lukowski, Iowa State’s director of sports nutrition for football. “And some don’t have that, so it’s a matter of, ‘OK, here’s how we can help you out here’ or ‘What can we do?’”

Nebraska has offered curbside-pickup meals for athletes near campus and Memphis sent 225 care packages containing items such as snacks and protective masks to its athletes in mid-April.

Lukowski said Iowa State’s care packages included protein powder along with bottles allowing athletes to mix their own shakes without a blender, as well as grocery lists with tips for shopping for healthy foods on a budget and what to stash in the pantry. The school also posted cooking tips and recipes such as chicken dishes, egg muffins and pancakes, among others.

Oregon State sports dietitian Toni Langhans has tried similar steps with the school’s “Quarantine Kitchen Series” on Instagram. She wants athletes to feel comfortable in the kitchen by making dishes such as overnight oatmeal, stuffed peppers, black bean burgers or homemade hummus instead of ordering daily takeout meals.

“It’s such a big important skill to work on that really affects the athlete’s overall relationship with food, and what they’re going to eat when they come back also,” Langhans said. “So that’s what we’re trying to push for in doing these demos and trying to give people recipes — something that’s easy to look at and say, ‘OK yeah, I think I can do that.’ … Sometimes quality food can take three minutes.”

Things have gone smoothly so far for Duke defensive end Chris Rumph II. He’s trying to strengthen his 6-3 frame while living with his parents in Knoxville, Tennessee, and has picked up 6 pounds (233) thanks largely to his mother’s cooking.

“We haven’t even left the house, so all I’m getting is home-cooked meals, protein and all that kind of stuff,” said Rumph, son of an assistant coach with the NFL’s Houston Texans. “So there’s no fast food. I haven’t had fast food in ... I think two months.”

Washington State offensive lineman Liam Ryan is staying in a house near the Pullman campus with roommates. They’ve been grilling so much steak, chicken, pork chops and salmon that they recently ran out of propane and had to get more.

The 6-5, 300-pound Ryan has focused on eating vegetables, brown rice and snacks like beef jerky or nuts. He’s also been checking the scales to ensure he’s staying near his playing weight.

“I think you just have to stay persistent on what you do because if you’re kind of just slacking and you miss a meal or you don’t work out — I mean, that’s what they do at the next level,” Ryan said. “At the NFL, the offseason’s kind of by yourself. So you get a little taste of it right now.”

Still, it’s hard to fight every craving for athletes removed from the hour-filling campus routines of weight training, practices and study hall. Ryan had a strong one for Chips Ahoy cookies, so he picked up multiple packages, then threw several cookies in a bowl with milk as though eating cereal.

“O-lineman stuff, right there,” he quipped.

Back at Nevada, Brown understands that challenge. He views it all as a test of “practicing self-control” when choosing what to bring home from the grocery store or picking up takeout from restaurants.

And yes, he has succumbed to the junk-food temptation. But when he has, he makes sure the next meal is a better one.

“At some point everybody’s going to come back,” Brown said. “I think the athletes that were able to eat well and really take care of their nutrition are going to be some of the athletes in better shape and be able to perform better. That’s really what it comes down to.”

Some landlords have expressed a sense of aggrieved betrayal at tenants who have not paid their rents; on Facebook groups such as “ACTION: New York City Rent Strike,” which has more than four thousand members, tenants have posted screenshots of increasingly infuriated e-mails and text messages. One tenant posted about a landlord who threatened retaliation on the family car, another reported that a landlord claims the building is “not eligible” for the eviction freeze. Other landlords have encouraged tenants to sign rent-deferral agreements, in which the tenant agrees to add the unpaid rent onto future rent payments. Some landlords have reminded tenants of their own bills; they have suggested that tenants could get jobs at Amazon or at grocery stores. They have encouraged tenants to charge their rent to a credit card, or to set up automatic debits.

If some landlords seem to be in denial about the inevitable effects of mass unemployment, Eric Kober, who was the director of housing, economic, and infrastructure planning at the New York Department of City Planning from 1991 to 2017, suggests they look to the seventies, when population loss and lack of financing resulted in large swathes of dilapidated and abandoned housing stock. “Ultimately, the system is capitalized,” Kober explained. “There needs to be cash flow in the system to keep it going.” If renters cannot pay and landlords get into financial trouble, buildings end up deteriorating. If the landlords default, banks, which have historically been bad at property management, end up owning buildings, and housing conditions worsen further. Property-tax revenue falls. Kober described it as a “downward spiral” that, in the past, has only halted when the government has provided low-cost loans or appointed emergency managers. When the government itself experiences a financial shortfall, as New York will, such financing becomes difficult to come by.

After losing eight hundred thousand residents in the nineteen-seventies, the city’s population grew in the nineties, swelling by approximately a million people, without an equivalent increase in housing construction. But Kober corrected the idea I had seen circulating that people leaving New York as a result of the pandemic might make the city more comfortable for the middle class. “The only way the population goes down is if the city ceases to be a beacon of opportunity, which would be a terrible loss for New York and for the entire country,” he said. He recalled moving to the city in 1980, when it was “dirty, rundown, and just generally unappealing” because of poorly funded services and infrastructure. If the city faces a similar fiscal crisis, he said, “it will be cheaper for the middle class to find housing in the city, but they won’t want to be here.”

Durante (Danny) Galeotafiore is perhaps a typical example of a New York landlord who has enjoyed the city’s several-decade run of prosperity. He moved to New York City from Naples, Italy, in 1976, opened Danny’s Pizza, off the Montrose L stop, in 1983, and bought his first building in Williamsburg in 1992. After a few years of high crime rates, the neighborhood boomed. He now owns five buildings in Williamsburg and in Ridgewood, Queens, with fourteen residential and commercial units. His last rent-controlled tenant, an eighty-five-year-old woman, pays seven hundred and fifty dollars a month in a building where everyone else pays twenty-five hundred. Since the lockdown, most of his tenants have paid their rents as usual, but some—a hair stylist, a bartender—have come calling. He has given them discounts, but chastises them for not having savings.

The thought that the city might not continue its inexorable rise toward higher prices seemed unthinkable to him. “They’re building left and right,” he said to me. “Everywhere, there’s no more parking spaces! Everywhere, nothing is for sale, everything is taken. ” He envisions that the impact of the coronavirus will be more like that of 9/11, when the market took a brief dip and then bounced back, than the kind of exodus that New York City saw in the seventies. “Where are they going to go, back home?” he asked me of his tenants. “Nobody wants to go back home. Do you want to go back to Minneapolis?”

I didn’t think so, but I first moved here in 2003—I only know the gentrified New York of low crime and delicious coffee. Until last month, the reasons I thought about leaving were all related to real estate: the instability of renting, the dream of buying an affordable house, “nature.” Before the pandemic, I was contemplating giving up my rental apartment, on the border of Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, to look for something cheaper in 2021. I love my apartment, a spacious fourth-floor walkup in a prewar building, and have no desire to move, but the rent keeps going up. In the seventies, the area had lost thirty per cent of its populations and, in fires after the 1977 blackout, dozens of buildings. All of that was hard to imagine now, as successive waves of gentrification, of people like me moving in, seemed only to accelerate. The dry cleaner shut, then the coffee shop—profitable businesses killed by landlords who thought that they could do better. Both storefronts are empty now. A Starbucks opened down the street. I watched as expensive restaurants and bars opened, and then failed. I lived in Miami during the real-estate bubble of the mid-two-thousands, and I saw some of the same signs in the hastily built condos that popped up like mushrooms, the profit motive evident in their low ceilings and cramped bedrooms, the reigning architectural theory seemingly that, if a window is big enough, you won’t notice that you’re living in a place inimical to the resident’s well-being. The Google reviews of these new developments had tenants complaining about sound carrying through thin walls, weed smoke wafting through the entire building, the promised bike room that never materialized. The landlords seemed to imagine an apparently endless supply of rootless young professionals; you rarely saw ads targeted toward the families such buildings displaced.

The truth is, I do maintain a little Zillow file of houses in Minneapolis, where I grew up, where you can buy a cute two-bedroom house in a city with progressive politics for hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a one-bedroom apartment in Bushwick. I have no plans to leave, and I don’t need my own washing machine or my own lawn, but I like to fantasize about having a home with relatively fixed long-term costs that I could plan a life around. For decades, the reigning philosophy of New York politics has been that the state and city governments should encourage real-estate development but not rent regulation. Politicians, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, were just starting to murmur about introducing some kind of universal rent control when the pandemic hit. After years in which small-business owners and the middle class accepted insecurity as the price of living in the paradise of New York City, are landlords about to get a reckoning?

It’s too early to tell the long-term effect of the pandemic on the rental market. Rents in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn were at record highs as March began, according to StreetEasy, but the number of new listings dropped by fifty-two per cent in the second half of March. The exception was short-term rentals, listings for which rose by seventy per cent compared to the same time last year, as uncertain renters showed a preference for more flexibility. Since the pandemic began, my social-media feeds have been full of the politics of staying or leaving. The well-to-do have retreated to their hill stations, and recriminations about public health from those without the means to leave themselves come with a side of envy. I lurk on a Facebook sublet group primarily used by people who identify as “digital nomads,” who, now “stuck” in Tulum, Hawaii, or Bali, are trying to off-load their New York apartments with an urgency that recalls the evacuation of the Pieds-Noirs on the verge of Algerian independence—seeking recommendations for movers who can pack up their places in absentia, looking for someone to take over their leases and buy all their Restoration Hardware furniture. It’s unclear whether these people ever really lived in New York, or just sustained a circular Airbnb economy; it’s equally unclear if what would be devastating for the fortunes of SoulCycle and Sweetgreen would be so bad for New York City. But, speaking purely anecdotally, a lot of people seem to be leaving town, especially young people who can ride out the quarantine with their parents, and the wealthy, who, according to news reports, are rushing to rent houses in the suburbs and upstate. The June crop of college grads will not arrive this year. Trump has halted immigration. If the city is going to lose people, it will need to help the ones who stay.",real

As a prisoner at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, NY, John J. Lennon has written about everything from mental health in the prison system, to fashion trends among inmates.

In his most recent story, published last month in Esquire, Lennon writes about the day the coronavirus arrived in Sing Sing. In it, Lennon described the ""primitive"" preventative health steps that inmates started taking — including sock-covered phones and nasal-spray bottles filled with bleach and water — after the prison registered its first confirmed coronavirus case.

State officials say measures like social distancing seem to be slowing the spread of COVID-19. But in prison, where social distancing is largely impossible, people are getting sick.

Earlier this month, state prison officials confirmed the first coronavirus-related death at Sing Sing. In an interview with Morning Edition, Lennon said it's only a matter of time before the rest of the inmates contract the virus.

""We're not at our so-called apex or crescendo here, because we're wrapped in a 30-foot wall,"" he said. ""It took a while to get in. But now it's in.""

Here are excerpts from the conversation, which you can listen to in full at the link above.

On whether social distancing is possible in Sing Sing

No, it's impossible. Social distancing, to the extent that you guys do it in society, is impossible to achieve in a place like Sing Sing and most prisons around the nation, I would say. The tier is like 2 feet wide. You literally have to like go chest-to-chest to slide by somebody.

On the health measures being taken in the prison

In terms of PPE [Personal Protective Equipment], so last week guards were approved to wear masks, but not prisoners. Last night, an announcement was made over the P.A. that said inmates are not allowed to cover their faces ... bars rattled and guys said, well, you can imagine what they said.

[Editor's note: In a statement to NPR, New York's Department of Corrections said it will soon ""issue an interim policy permitting incarcerated individuals to use their state-issued handkerchiefs to cover their mouths.""]

Does the population have access to COVID-19 tests?

I don't know who's being tested. I think the short answer is not many people are being tested. Last report we got was seven incarcerated guys were tested positive and about 30 officers were tested positive. That was last week.

There are people who would say, as far as concern goes, we need to be concerned with people who aren't serving time for serious crimes.

You're talking about the pecking order that we all say we don't have. ... When those gurneys start pulling up to the hospitals from Sing Sing, I think we're all going to know where we are in the pecking order. It's a sobering realization. I think I've done pretty pretty OK for myself in the past 20 years I've been in prison. I was a lowlife when I came to prison. I got quite a future when I get out. I want to live.",real

Also called the TRACE Act (Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone), the bill was co-sponsored by 58 house democrats and touts that it would allow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to provide grants to some hospitals, schools, and nonprofits to help fight the coronavirus.

“This bill authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to award grants for testing, contact tracing, monitoring, and other activities to address COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).” [SOURCE]

However, the law would also give these organizations the power to test Americans for Covid-19 “as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes,” and give the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to forcibly remove Americans from their homes if “necessitated by the circumstances of the declared emergency.” [SOURCE]

This bill is in clear violation of the fourth amendment, which guarantees, “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”

The key word here is ‘unreasonable’, however, meaning if the Supreme Court classifies it as ‘reasonable’, these home invasions will remain legal despite being clearly against the spirit of the law.

The push for forced entry echoes remarks made by the World Health Organization’s Dr. Michael Ryan in early April.

“In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units, now we need to go and look in families and find those people who may be sick and remove them, and isolate them, in a safe and dignified manner.” – Dr. Michael Ryan [SOURCE]

The Queen of England voiced her support for forced entry as she compared it to British evacuations prior to the London bombings of WWII.

“[Citizens were] evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a painful separation from their loved ones but now, as then, we know, deep down, it is the right thing to do.” [SOURCE]

The TRACE Act has a keen focus on ‘contact tracing’, a term that effectively means government surveillance of our everyday behavior.

Its purpose is to test for who has the coronavirus and to whom they may have come in contact.

In Washington State, the government will soon require restaurants catalogue the phone numbers, emails, and time of arrival of every customer.

You may want to think twice if you believe that these programs will ever go away once enacted. Governments rarely give up power without incredible pushback from voters.

Edward Snowden articulated this brilliantly while the pandemic was still in its early stage.

“Do you truly believe that when the first wave, this second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long-forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept?

“That these datasets will not be kept? No matter how it is being used, what is being built is the architecture of oppression.” – Edward Snowden [SOURCE]

Interestingly, Bill Gates was recently awarded patent #060606 for a, “crypto currency system using human body activity data.” In layman terms, it’s a patent for a digital tattoo microchip which can detect ‘body activity.’

Millions of dollars have already been awarded to companies for similar technologies by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

594,23,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/coronavirus-infections-may-be-going-undetected/,2020-02-24,Coronavirus Infections May Be Going Undetected,"A new study from Imperial College London researchers based at the W.H.O Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Analysis, and J-IDEA-Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics suggests that nearly two thirds of new cases of COVID-19 have gone undetected.

Sangeeta Bhatia, author of the 6th report explained in a statement that, “We compared the average monthly number of passengers traveling from [outbreak epicenter] Wuhan to major international destinations with the number of COVID-19 cases that have been detected overseas. Based on these data, we then estimate the number of cases that are undetected globally and find that approximately two thirds of the cases might be undetected at this point. Our findings confirm similar analyses carried out by other groups.”

Previous research has shown that only a small subsection of confirmed cases display serious symptoms such as pneumonia, and globally researchers are working to understand how the virus spreads as well as determine why/if the virus can be transmitted by those who are not displaying any symptoms. Based on the numbers released by China the total fatality rate is fairly low, but this could change especially if the virus mutates, and there is speculation of the figures provided being seriously downplayed.

Globally there are over 78,000 confirmed reported cases, with new cases in Africa, Italy, South Korea, America, Iran, Asia, and China causing the reported number of causes and deaths to spike over the last few days. Financially even the global market is feeling the effects of the coronavirus leading to worries from investors regarding a global economic slowdown. The Chinese economy is suggested to have already taken as much as a $60 billion loss, and if the fallout from the virus can’t be contained it could cost the Chinese economy as much as a staggering $6 trillion. What is worse is that this could spiral outwards, as much of the world has come to rely on China, resulting in a global recession that many markets will not be able to weather.

With the continued widespread of the virus outside of China has some scientists worried, “We are starting to see more cases reported from countries and regions outside mainland China with no known travel history or link to Wuhan City,” noted co-author Natsuko Imai in the statement. Hence why their report “demonstrates the importance of surveillance and case detection if countries are to successfully contain the epidemic.”

Cases vary in severity of symptoms, making some cases harder to detect than others, and some countries have reported detecting significantly fewer cases than would be expected based on the volume of flight passengers arriving from affected cities, especially that of the epicenter Wuhan City, China.

Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg, report author, added: “We compiled data from a variety of publicly available sources, such as national and provincial ministries of health and local news, to determine information about travel history, exposure and symptom onset of individual patients observed outside of mainland China. We would like to thank countries for their continued transparency in presenting information on new cases, and would like to encourage communication of patient outcomes going forward to present a true picture of severity and clinical presentation.”

63% of cases are estimated to be undetected based on comparisons with Singapore only; when comparing with Singapore, Finland, Nepal, Belgium, Sweden, India, Sri Lanka and Canada 73% of cases of COVID-19 are estimated to be undetected.

Professor Christl Donnelly, report author, explained: “We were able to analyse data collected around the world to determine how individual countries compared to those who have reported and confirmed the high numbers of cases compared to their connectedness with Wuhan city (as judged by the average number of international passengers per month). Bringing these numbers together we have estimated that worldwide two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have not been picked up by surveillance programmes.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, report author, added:“Countries around the world have been focused on containing the international spread of COVID-19 by detecting cases in travellers from China. However, surveillance approaches and capabilities have varied between countries. The resulting variation in the numbers of cases detected in each allows us to assess what proportion of cases in travellers may have been detected overall, by comparing case numbers in the countries with the highest detection rates with those in other countries. In agreement with the results from similar studies, we conclude that approximately two-thirds of cases in travellers from China have not yet been detected. It is highly likely that some of these undetected cases will have started chains of transmission within the countries they entered.”

In separate research with findings published in the Lancet suggest that 61.5% of coronavirus patients with severe pneumonia will not survive; patients especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection which includes the old, young and those with existing conditions are more likely to die at a higher rate than they did from SARS and MERS.

This study of 52 critically ill adults of 710 at Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital has found that 61.5% of affected patients that required hospitalization and intensive monitoring succumbed to the virus to become “non-survivors.” Based on their findings the researchers concluded that COVD-19/ SARS-CoV-2 is more lethal for vulnerable patients than patients of MERS or SARS were; findings are presented in a series of tables breaking down each patient’s symptoms and path to recovery/death. The 52 patients had a mean age of 59.7 years old, 35 were men of which 40% had been diagnosed with some kind of chronic illness, 98% were found to have a fever, and 61.5% died by 28 days.

“Like SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients.12 However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation. 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort13 and a Hong Kong cohort,14 respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days.15 Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.”

UPDATE: Switzerland, Austria, Croatia and Spain confirm first coronavirus cases: Two cases have been reported in Austria’s Tyrol state, one case in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, one in mainland Spain’s Catalonia region and one in Switzerland’s Ticino region, likely affecting European stock markets which closed around 2% lower on Tuesday; Italy continues to be the most affected country in Europe.",fake

The Democratic Party's presumptive nominee showed in a 30-second clip accompanying his tweet on Saturday that Trump was playing a round of golf at his club in the US state of Virginia on Memorial Day Weekend.

“Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work,” the former vice president said in his tweet. “Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing.”

“The death toll is still rising,” read the ad, which has garnered over 1.3 million views. “The president is playing golf.”

The golf trip was the president’s first visit to one of his money-making properties since March 8, when he visited his private golf club in West Palm Beach during a weekend at his Florida home.

The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic on March 11, and Trump followed with the national emergency declaration two days later.

Trump has ordered US flags on federal buildings and national monuments to half-staff through Sunday in memory of the Americans who have lost their lives to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

US Democrats have criticized Trump since the epidemic erupted in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, saying he has failed to develop a comprehensive and effective plan for testing Americans for the coronavirus and tracing contacts of those who are infected by the virus.

Biden has on several occasions censured Trump since the outbreak started in the United States in February, framing the US president's response to the crisis as inadequate.

In another ad released earlier this month, the Biden campaign accused Trump of mishandling the epidemiological crisis and the economic fallout it caused by failing to implement containment measures sooner.

Virologists say people who contract the coronavirus in the US are at greater risk than those in the UK or Canada since America lacks a national health service.

The US has recorded over 1.6 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus and more than 98,000 deaths from the flu-like pathogen, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",fake

Thousands in Southend, Brighton, Cornwall and London are immune from COVID-19. Well, how else do you explain the crowds sunbathing and playing in the sea forgetting all about social distancing this week? It’s great news that it appears we are beginning to turn the corner on Coronavirus but there is clearly still a long way to go.

We, the British public, have played a massive part in this happening by staying at home for weeks. It’s been a real team effort and we have all done our duty but now it is clear that some have decided to play by different rules and they are threatening the safety of us all.

Fighting COVID on the Beaches?

The Furlough scheme was not designed for people to have in effect an extended holiday whilst other essential workers are risking their lives. If you are furloughed or can’t work in your normal place you are meant to stay at home apart from exercising and getting the shopping in. That’s too difficult, is it?

Likewise, the easing of the lockdown was meant to be all about getting more people back to work, not a green light for everyone to do a Cliff Richard and go on a summer holiday.

I have been extremely critical of the government’s lack of clarity on their messaging but it is not Boris Johnson’s fault that selfish fools have decided to decamp to the seaside.

Every person who has been on the beaches of Brighton or Bournemouth is a disgrace and a selfish bastard.

They also supplied a real slap in the face of those workers who are still getting to work and doing their jobs. As the Sex Pistols sang they are “having a cheap holiday in other people’s misery”.

Not only that but they are dicing not only with their own death but with the lives of millions of Brits. Whilst they frolic in the sea they are just increasing the chances of a second wave that could well turn into a tsunami of deaths.

Tourist boards and the cops shouldn’t be having to try and force these selfish morons to sunbathe in their own gardens or their nearest park; these people should realise they have to be team players and work for the common good.

I fully understand why people are getting restless after two months of misery but breaking the lockdown in this manner is just not acceptable. There are no excuses.

There has been much war talk and imagery during the pandemic but at the moment we are clearly not fighting Coronavirus on the beaches, we are actually collaborating with it.

Consult the Experts

Instead of coming up with more gimmicks like an app, immunity certificates, or quarantine for people arriving in the UK we need Boris to lead from the front and get back to a basic message which is, we all need to play our part and work for the common good.

He also needs to treat us like adults and tell us the facts and be straight with us and admit that this NHS app doesn’t and isn’t going to work. Boris needs to man up and tell us this and admit his mistakes instead of hiding behind it like a pound shop Wizard of Oz.

Immunity certificates won’t be worth the paper they’re written on and how the hell are our police expected to enforce it or check on it?

The same goes for this ridiculous idea of a 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the UK. This is unworkable and at least two months too late and will kill the airline and holiday industry.

Instead of coming up with madcap ideas that can’t be policed and are in effect just a PR con or exercise, Boris should be calling in the Like of Ryanair Boss, Michael O’Leary and Stelios and getting their input and ideas. Likewise, Tim Martin of Wetherspoons should be on some kind of committee to get our pubs and clubs reopened. He has the expertise and experience, so let’s use that to move us forward.

Do Your Duty

However, we all need to do our bit too and it is not just those on the beaches who need to take a long hard look at themselves in the mirror.

What about the fools who have decided that the lack of traffic on the roads is a reason for them to drive like madmen around the streets. Warwick has been turned into the Monaco of the Midlands with selfish tools racing around the one-way system. Posing a real danger to themselves and others.

Talking of driving have the people who have joined the mile-long queues to get a MacDonald’s not learned anything from this pandemic about the connection between obesity and possible death from COVID-19?

Why would you wait to pick up a sugar-laden snack or a Starbucks? Is your life really that shallow and devoid of meaning that you would wait for hours to pick up this crap? Watching this cavalcade of junk, I’m reminded of the lyrics of ‘Psycle Sluts’ by the poet John Cooper Clarke, “For you, that's how the world could end. Not with a bang but a Wimpy” (or nowadays a McDonalds!)

There has been much talk in the newspapers of how the lockdown and pandemic will change people’s attitudes to life and that perhaps we will be less selfish and less obsessed with consumerism but judging by the early reactions to the easing of lockdown I don’t hold out much hope for that.

Unlike Mrs Thatcher, I do believe there is such a thing as society. When Boris talked with such optimism during the recent election campaign it galvanised people and gave him a massive majority. This enabled him, amongst other things, to deliver Brexit but we need some of that collective will and optimism again now to defeat a much bigger enemy than the undemocratic EU.

We must all do our duty.

As restrictions around the coronavirus caused restaurants across the country to halt dine-in service, many people staying at home turned to food delivery apps.

Wendy Reynolds, a 34-year-old food delivery driver in Elkhart, Indiana, has seen a big increase in orders. Before the COVID-19 crisis, Reynolds said that on average a food delivery driver in Indiana could make about $400 for a relaxed 40-hour workweek. Since COVID-19, she said that has gone up to $700 or $800 a week.

“Our orders have more than tripled and it seems like people are turning more to this delivery as the stay-at-home orders are put into place,” Reynolds told ABC News.

While working as a delivery driver at the height of the pandemic, Reynolds made the decision to stay in Airbnb rentals and hotels, paying up to $600 a week for a room to sleep in.

“The hardest part personally would just have to be the isolation that I've experienced from my children,” Reynolds said. “I have two daughters. They aren't with me during all of this because I'm afraid of it. I'm afraid that I would give them something that would get infected and somehow infect them.”

Although business is booming, Reynolds has found herself working exhausting 14-hour days and facing new challenges. As the demand for takeout and delivery has increased, Reynolds said sometimes she now has to wait in long drive-thru lines to pick up orders.

“That order can only be $4 and we're waiting for 15 cars to get up there to get our order, and then we have to still drive it 15 minutes away,” Reynolds said. “So it's hard. You have to work all day or night to make it.”

Wendy Reynolds is seen here at one of her art shows. Wendy Reynolds

Reynolds has also had to adjust to no-contact deliveries, which means she has limited interaction with both restaurants and customers.

“When you come up and you give them their food, there's interaction and that just all stopped,” she said.

While out making deliveries, she has struggled to find somewhere to use the restroom without having to travel all the way back to her current Airbnb or hotel. Usually, she could go into restaurants or gas stations and use their restrooms, but now these restrooms are often closed.

Although gas prices have gone down due to the current crisis, Reynolds said the amount of driving she is doing is resulting in increased wear and tear on the car. To work as a delivery driver, she said she is constantly buying tires and doing repairs. In the past few months, she said she has spent over $5,000 on her car in repairs alone.

In audio diaries she recorded, Reynolds talks about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected her life and work as a food delivery driver. Her personal story can be heard in this week’s episode of the ABC News podcast “The Essentials: Inside the Curve.”

Before her life changed due to the pandemic, Reynolds would host shows to share her art and the rocks she collects, such as geodes and agates. This hobby has been meaningful to her since her first experience hosting an art show.

A selection of Wendy Reynolds' painted rocks. Wendy Reynolds

'It was just for me to sell my art and it was just a beautiful setting and I just remember feeling that night, like, this is a great moment. 'Tonight's a great moment for me,'"" Reynolds said.

As the future remains uncertain due to the coronavirus, Reynolds has been worrying about when the crisis will end and whether she will be able to safely hand out sack lunches to the homeless again. It's a volunteer activity that she does every summer with her two daughters, who are 15 and 12 years old. She said it’s important for her to teach her children to give to those who are in need.

Wendy Reynolds says she usually makes sack lunches for the homeless every year. Wendy Reynolds

“In my life, I've had ... my ups and downs just like anyone else, and I have found myself out about and needing, and being a person in need,” Reynolds said. “You see people out there on the side of the road hungry, laying down, sleeping on the side of the road. And my kids, you know, they don't understand, but their mother has been there.”

Reynolds recently made the decision to return home to her daughters, where they are taking small steps to being together again while still avoiding close contact.

“I needed to be around some people, mentally,” she said. “I'm happy that I'm back around them and I'm just glad that I'm not alone now.”",real

Health authorities in the Republic of China are focusing more and more on millennia-old traditional medicines to treat the novel coronavirus which has so far reportedly killed more than 630 people and infected over 32,000 worldwide.

It has been reported that eight patients infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have been treated and cured by a combination of TCM and Western medicine in Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The patients were discharged from the hospital on February 4, 2020. They are the first batch of patients cured by such a hybrid treatment in the hospital, one of the designated institutes admitting patients infected with the virus in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.

As such, the National Health Commission of China on recently published its latest treatment plan designed to target symptoms of the coronavirus, and is urging medical institutes to include both molecular medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in their formulas. Currently there still is no cure for the virus yet, and with an increasing death toll and infection rate, national authorities are looking for a cocktail mixture of Asian and Western medicines in hopes of preventing further spread and saving more lives.

Their announced treatment plan suggests that there are certain traditional Chinese medicine therapies, using the most advanced DNA codification technology to mitigate patients’ symptoms — including fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, lack of energy and nausea — that could be applied depending on the patient’s “recent state of illness, local climate characteristics and current physical condition.” Boehmeria nivea, Chinese patchouli, sun-dried tangerine peels, betel nuts, as well as the Peaceful Palace Bovine Bezoar Pill — a mixture of cattle gallstone, buffalo horn, and pearl and ruby sulfur, among other ingredients — are all being considered or already prescribed under the plan.

Just as Asian medicine is currently being promoted to fight the coronavirus — as it was in 2003 during the SARS epidemic — supporters of the age-old practice believe the government’s push will give the long-debated industry a chance to prove its worth.

In the case of Boehmeria nivea, as presented by Forall Biotech to the Shanghai CDC authorities, its purported reasons to support mitigation and relief of the associated symptoms stem from its rich content in: Chlorogenic Acid (C16H18O9), Caffeic Acid (C9H8O4), p-Coumaric Acid (C9H8O3), Ferulic Acid (C10H10O4), Gallic Acid (C7H6O5), Benzoic Acid(C7H6O2), Epicatechin (C15H14O6), Rutin (C27H30O16), Isoquercetin (C21H20O12) and Hyperoside (C21H20O12).

As an example, for HCV Particle Entry, Caffeic Acid is associated with Apolipoprotein E, which attaches to the plasma membrane and promotes capsid uncoating and HCV RNA emission. For Tannic Acid, it leads to binding of receptors and induce endocytosis.

More research needs to be undertaken to test whether such an approach could provide a cure for the virus. In the meantime, TCM treatment shall not be directly aimed at combating viruses, but more to regulate and uphold the body’s immune system.

Zhang Boli, director of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine said during a press conference that TCM treatment, “is not aimed at viruses, but more to regulate the body’s immune system. It is not advisable for everyone to take Chinese medicine for disease prevention.”

Zhang Guojun, a professor at Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine says, “Traditional Chinese medicine plays a role in the entire clinical process, no matter if it’s for the diagnosis and treatment of common ailments or for severe problems.”

Jiao Yahui, deputy director of medical administration and supervision at the National Health Commission says TCM has played “a very important role” in alleviating the symptoms of coronavirus patients. She added that it has also helped delay mild cases from developing into severe ones, which “can be verified by clinical data and cases.”",fake
611,1862,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-visits-one-his-private-golf-courses-first-time-75-n1213746,2020-05-23,Trump visits one of his private golf courses for first time in 75 days,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump kicked off his Memorial Day weekend by visiting his club in Virginia, marking the president's first time back at one of his private golf courses in 75 days, the longest stretch of his administration without spending time at one.

He was seen leaving the White House on Saturday morning wearing a white hat, white shirt and no mask as his motorcade made its way to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.

Trump last visited his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida the weekend of March 6 where he hosted several Brazilian officials, one of whom tested positive for the coronavirus shortly after the trip.

The president spent most of the rest of March locked down at the White House participating in near-daily press briefings with the White House coronavirus task force highlighting the administration's response to the pandemic. The briefings were abandoned in late April after Trump was criticized for suggesting people might be able to prevent the coronavirus by injecting or ingesting toxic household cleaning products.

Recently, Trump has begun to take day trips outside of Washington to thank factory workers producing medical equipment used to combat the coronavirus.

During a press conference at the White House on Friday, Dr. Deborah Birx, the Trump administration's coronavirus coordinator, emphasized that it was okay to participate in normal Memorial Day weekend activities, such as golfing, as long as people practiced social distancing and took other precautions.

""Please, as you go out this weekend, understand that you can be outside and you can play golf, and you can play tennis with marked balls,"" Brix said. ""You can go to the beaches if you stay six feet apart. But remember that is your space. And that is the space you need to protect to ensure you are social distancing for others.""

Trump was seen playing with three other people at his golf course Saturday and was seen driving a golf cart alone around the course. At one point, Trump patted another golfer on the shoulder. None of the players were seen wearing a mask.

So far this month, the president has twice visited Camp David but it’s unclear whether he golfed during either of those “working” weekends. Camp David reportedly has at least one hole and a driving range, but the White House has not stated publicly whether the president has played since early March.

“I'd really like to play golf but it's too busy right now,” the president told reporters earlier this month. Trump also tweeted recently he had not played “in a long time.”

Trump called into an NBC PGA special last weekend and conceded he missed the game.

“I do miss it. I haven't played, really, since this problem that we have started. I haven't been able to play golf for a while. I've been very busy, and I think that it’s just one of those things, but we're getting back to normal,” Trump said.

Last year, the president had a new, room-size golf simulator installed in the White House, replacing an older version used by former President Barack Obama.

Trump regularly enjoyed golfing and spending time at his various self-branded clubs throughout the country before the coronavirus pandemic. NBC News records indicate the president has visited his own properties on more than 400 days since taking office, about a third of his total term.",fake

The retailer, based in Fort Worth, Texas, announced in a news release Tuesday that it was seeking bankruptcy court approval to begin an “orderly wind-down” when stores are able to reopen ""following the government-mandated closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

In January, Pier 1 said it planned to close up to 450 stores, or nearly half of its locations. It then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February.

Robert Riesbeck, Pier 1’s CEO and chief financial officer, said the company had been working to find a buyer to continue operating before the coronavirus.

More store closings:J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores – or 242 locations – as part of its bankruptcy

E-commerce boost:Walmart sales increase 10% as online buying grew 74% during coronavirus pandemic

""Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,” Riesbeck said.

Pier 1 is currently accepting orders on its website and said it will ""initiate store closing efforts and liquidation sales once store locations can reopen, in compliance with COVID-19 guidelines from local government and health officials.""

The company says it has approximately 541 U.S. stores and in the court filing says it plans to reopen some stores on or around May 22.

More retailers are expected to file for bankruptcy and more stores are expected to close because of the impact of COVID-19. J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy Friday, said it plans to close 242 locations.

Pier 1 returns: What you need to know

The company said in its court filing that if its order is approved it will accept returns for the first 30 days from the date it is approved “so long as the return is otherwise in compliance with the Debtors’ return policies in effect as of the date such item was purchased.”

Returns of items sold in the liquidation sale of the company’s initial closing stores will not be accepted.

Pier 1 gift cards, loyalty certificates

Pier 1 has proposed that valid gift certificates, gift cards, and loyalty certificates issued previously will be accepted for 21 days from when the order is approved on its website. Then the gift cards and certificates would be accepted for the first 21 days “from the date of the reopening of any store” for in-person purchases only.

After the 21 days, they will not be accepted and “deemed to have no remaining value,” according to the court filing.

The special will air Friday, May 15, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.

""Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line"" goes to the floors of the largest hospital in the hardest-hit borough of New York City. Montefiore Medical Center's Moses Campus was bursting with nearly 700 patients, 80% of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19.

A CBS News team, clad in protective equipment, spent seven days in the emergency department and intensive care units following physicians as they urgently placed patients on breathing machines and resuscitated others suffering cardiac failure.

The medical staff fear getting sick and exposing their families, even as they treat the gravely ill.

""We're often talking about life and death situations. There are no small emergencies. They'e all patients having respiratory distress or cardiac arrest,"" says Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of Critical Care Medicine.

The hospital had to convert an auditorium to treat the staggering increase in COVID-19 patients — 70 of whom died during the week CBS News was embedded.

Alongside the loss, there are victories: In that same time span, more than 300 patients recovered and were able to go home.

Nurse Jasmine Christakos, a Bronx native, dances whenever the hospital overhead speaker announces a ""happy code,"" signaling a patient has been discharged or taken off a ventilator.

""It's just so hopeful and brings so much joy during dark times and reminds us that people do go home … people do beat this,"" Christakos says.

The documentary captures the toll the disease has taken on one of the poorest and worst-stricken neighborhoods in New York City and the nation. A Bronx father lights candles and prays that his son, a first responder, will recover and come home from the hospital. From the back of a pickup truck, a parish priest rolls through the neighborhood with a loudspeaker, blessing the sick and homebound.

And a Montefiore nurse, Selena Thomas, grows weary as she counts the lives lost to a cruel and mysterious virus.

""It's necessary for us to acknowledge that some communities have been touched by COVID more than others,"" Thomas says. ""If we don't acknowledge that we can't fix the problem.""

""Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line"" tells the story of a global crisis through the people of one city, one community, and one hospital.

A new report by the Mirror claims that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who was confirmed to be struggling with the COVID-19 disease, defied COVID-19 lockdown restrictions for the second time, after he was identified in Houghall Woods, Durham, two weeks after reports of his first trip to the town.

Cummings, said to have traveled to visit his parents, was spotted on Sunday 19 April at a local beauty salon in Houghall Woods, according to the report. He commented to people passing by saying, “Aren’t the bluebells lovely?”

In response to the report, Johnson's office said they would not “waste our time” answering “inaccurate reporting” by the Mirror and the Guardian newspapers on the UK PM's senior aide.

“Yesterday the Mirror and Guardian wrote inaccurate stories about Mr Cummings. Today they are writing more inaccurate stories including claims that Mr Cummings returned to Durham after returning to work in Downing Street on 14 April. We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers,” Downing Street said in a statement on Saturday.

Friday’s reports on Johnson’s right-hand man traveling on 5 April some 400 km (250 miles) to northern England after potentially having been exposed to COVID-19, has sparked wide criticism, with the Labour Party calling for his speedy resignation.

Johnson confirmed his key advisor's first journey to Durham, arguing that Cummings did not break coronavirus lockdown guidelines for all UK citizens as the political adviser made the journey to ensure that his young son be properly cared for after his mother tested positive for the novel virus.

Later on Saturday, the prime minister resisted calls from the opposition party to fire his senior adviser, while meanwhile Number 10 ministers have expressed their support for Cummings.",fake
632,876,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/sports/basketball/when-nba-come-back.html,2020-05-13,"Can the N.B.A. Come Back, and Stay Back?","
Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein’s weekly N.B.A. newsletter here.Firm predictions about the fate of professional sports leagues continue to be futile in the midst of a global pandemic.
What N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has proclaimed to be “the single greatest challenge” the league has ever faced remains its most fluid challenge, too.
Early in his conference call Friday night with the N.B.A. Players Association, Silver did say, “Since we stopped the season, the goal has been to restart the season.” Yet it is still only a goal, two months into the suspension of play, in part because no one — not even Silver — is sure whether the league can stay back, so to speak, once it comes back.
“No decision we make will be risk-free,” Silver told the players, according to a recording of the teleconference reviewed by The New York Times. “We’re going to be living with this virus for the foreseeable future.”
Imagine a rebooted N.B.A. season in July or August. Playing on in the face of new positive tests, player trepidation, gloomy forecasts about a second wave of infections, criticism from countless external forces and the inevitable obstacles we can’t even pinpoint yet — it all looms as deeply daunting stuff.
Sean Doolittle of the Washington Nationals may as well have been speaking for several of his N.B.A. counterparts on Monday when he unleashed a 16-tweet thread to publicly question what Major League Baseball has planned in terms of “protections for players, families, staff, stadium workers and the work force it would require to resume a season.”
The N.B.A., mind you, is not without hope. There has been some real progress in the testing arena, starting with the Orlando Magic’s ability to secure clearance last week from local health officials and the league to test asymptomatic players and staff members. With the Lakers and Clippers also expected to soon receive similar blessings in Los Angeles, Orlando’s breakthrough makes it somewhat easier to imagine the N.B.A. reaching a point in coming weeks where all 30 teams can administer tests freely without worrying about taking tests from needier segments of the public.
A far thornier issue for Silver, in his contact sport, figures to be answering the array of health-and-safety questions akin to those Doolittle so forcefully posed to M.L.B.’s elders. Perhaps the resistance is not universal, but there are surely N.B.A. players apprehensive about returning. The question-and-answer session of Silver’s call began and ended with complaints from Oklahoma City’s Chris Paul and the Nets’ Kyrie Irving that some of their peers already feel pressure to return to team practice facilities for individual workouts in what surely rank as the most sanitized gyms on Earth at the moment — even though only two teams (Cleveland and Portland) had opened their practice facilities at the time of the call.
“It’s an issue employers everywhere are going to have to confront,” Michele Roberts, the union’s executive director, told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne last week. “Because I guarantee there’s going to be at least one player, if not many more than that, that are going to have genuine concerns about their safety.”
Silver does not want to apply pressure. He made it clear to his Friday audience that, while there can be no such thing as a risk-free return without a coronavirus vaccine, players cannot be forced back to work by team owners or the league office.
“We’re not going to make any decisions that aren’t joint,” Silver told them.As I’ve been advising for weeks, keep your eye on Germany as a possible preview of what awaits Silver’s league this summer. Bundesliga soccer isn’t N.B.A. basketball, but the Bundesliga is a league of global stature and poised to return to operations this weekend with what it calls “ghost games” — matches without fans.
The Bundesliga approach calls for any player or team staff member who tests positive to be quarantined for 14 days — while the rest of the group carries on.
Could that sort of protocol work on these shores? Would N.B.A. players really stomach the idea of showing up for the next day’s practice or game after a teammate or two was forced into quarantine? Are teams in North America, and their fans, prepared to accept the possibility that a star player will be forced to leave the team for up to two weeks in the middle of the playoffs as if he had sustained a more common injury? Are the star player’s teammates going to be willing to play without him?
Do we dare limit our focus to those sufficiently unsettling questions without asking: What if someone dies?
We don’t have any detailed answers yet. Nor, frankly, do the German soccer authorities, who are at least two months ahead of the N.B.A. Dynamo Dresden, in the Bundesliga’s second tier, will not return to the field this weekend as scheduled, because local health authorities demanded that the entire team be quarantined after two new coronavirus cases, overruling the league officials who would merely have isolated the individuals who had tested positive.
So we repeat: Coming back is one thing. Staying back is another entirely.There is no mystery, by contrast, about the forces behind the push for a conclusion to the 2019-20 season. Nearly 80 percent of the 82-game schedule was completed before play was suspended, but crowning a champion, as the N.B.A. has managed to do in each of its previous 73 seasons, is a secondary aim at this point.
It’s a money thing as much as anything.Silver told players that game-night income from fans accounts for roughly 40 percent of the league’s annual revenue, drawing focus to concerns about the financial consequences of a canceled season — how that would affect the salary cap, free agency, future earnings and the very existence of the current collective bargaining agreement. The gravity of Silver’s statement, with no one in the league expecting to see fans in its buildings before 2021 at the earliest, needed little elaboration.
Yet the money vs. safety calculus is as tricky as it gets. Critics will say that the N.B.A. is irresponsible in hurrying to come back before there is a significant medical development to combat the coronavirus. Defenders will counter by pointing out that there’s little benefit to waiting for a comeback when the conditions may be no more favorable in the winter than they are in the summer or fall.
Silver stressed to the players that no decisions have to be made before June 1 — that there’s still time — but the clock’s ticking will surely get a lot louder for everyone the closer we get to July.
The math will have to get done at some point. The lone comfort for the players is that they will have a louder voice than usual.
The very personal assessment involved in deciding “how much risk we’re all comfortable taking,” as Silver put it, was nobody’s idea of player empowerment when the season started. But here we are.

Corner Three
You ask; I answer. Every week in this space, I’ll field three questions posed via email at marcstein-newsletter@nytimes.com. Please include your first and last name, as well as the city you’re writing in from, and make sure “Corner Three” is in the subject line. (Responses may be condensed and lightly edited for clarity.)
Q: I’m so confused as to why a non-playoff team with nothing to play for would open their doors. Can anyone explain this? — @joey_buckets3 from Twitter
Stein: The Cleveland Cavaliers aren’t going to the playoffs even if the N.B.A. manages to restart its 2019-20 season. Yet the Cavs were the first franchise to welcome players back Friday when teams in states where shelter-in-place restrictions have been eased were allowed to unlock their practice facilities.
One of the best explanations came from Cleveland’s Larry Nance Jr. After spending about 90 minutes Friday lifting weights and partaking in some catch-and-shoot drills, Nance said, “It was more for mental health than physical, to be honest with you.”
Allowing players to return to the gym, even if teams are initially limited to a maximum of four players inside at any time, is the first step back toward normalcy for athletes whose lives have been disrupted like never before by the coronavirus. It’s also a matter of safety. League and team officials think it’s wisest to make their own facilities available to discourage players from seeking out unauthorized gyms that aren’t sanitized to the same standard.
But there are other good reasons. The N.B.A., for starters, has made it clear that it hopes to resume play with a few regular-season games involving all 30 teams, not just those who were playoff-bound when play was halted March 11.
Another one: As we’ve discussed in the newsletter previously, many N.B.A. athletic training staffs would want to give their players up to six weeks’ worth of supervised prep time before games restarted after such a long layoff. The more likely scenario is a ramp-up period closer to three weeks to give the league as much of the summer as possible to complete as much of the remaining schedule as it can.
From a league perspective, by making facilities available to players well before teams officially reconvene, it can assert that players have been provided a theoretical head start on the road to getting back into basketball shape to compensate for the potential forthcoming crunch.
Q: Why do league rules prohibit teams from buying these hoops? — @NateAllard from TwitterStein: Nate’s question comes in response to my recent piece with Scott Cacciola on the reality that many N.B.A. players, counterintuitive as it sounds, do not have a basket at home and thus have struggled to get shots up during a suspension of play that hit the two-month mark on Monday.
In March, the league informed teams that furnishing players with “individual workout equipment of a modest cost” was permissible. But buying a hoop, they were told, would be considered salary-cap circumvention.
The list of approved equipment for teams to supply includes workout mats, workout balls, resistance bands and “modest” free-weight sets. Paying for the delivery of boxed meals to players is also allowed.
Q: Great memories from that Knicks-Lakers Game 7 in 1970. I, too, was there as a 13-year-old, like Spike Lee, and went with my friend, whose father had tickets in Section 106. A reporter from Los Angeles, Bud Furillo, helped us get some autographs. I recognize Donnie May and Mike Riordan in the main photo that ran with your story, but who is the player on the right? — Paul Winston
Stein: Leaping in the air in that photo, in celebration, was Cazzie Russell. We initially had the photo captioned improperly last week, but the error was quickly spotted by a few Knicks die-hards who wrote in — like Morton Frank of Redwood City, Calif.
As Mr. Frank put it, “Cazzie’s Adidas sneakers and comparatively low socks” are clear giveaways for some fans. “To this day, I can give you the same detail and trivia on the whole team,” he wrote. “To love the old Knicks is to love them all the way.”
I really enjoyed talking to Spike and Marv Albert (and our own Harvey Araton) to learn more about that team and that series, because I certainly wasn’t consuming any of it as a 1-year-old.
It’s always bothered me that history doesn’t get passed down with the same vigor in basketball as it does in baseball, which has sparked me in adulthood to embrace every opportunity to find out more about the long-overlooked 1970s, which was a period of great struggle for the sport.
For Knicks fans especially, Friday’s 50th anniversary of the win that clinched the first title in franchise history was a welcome respite, since this season was otherwise destined to be remembered for the curiously timed ousters of David Fizdale and Steve Mills; James L. Dolan’s shabby treatment of Lee; and multiple instances in which the sad state of the franchise inspired loud “Sell the Team” chants.

Numbers Game
4With 36 points and 19 assists in the Knicks’ Game 7 triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1970 N.B.A. finals, Walt Frazier is one of only four players in league history to post at least 20 points and 10 assists in a Game 7 of the league’s championship series, according to Basketball Reference. The others:Jerry West (42 points, 12 assists and 13 rebounds in the Lakers’ Game 7 loss to Boston in 1969)James Worthy (36 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds in the Lakers’ Game 7 victory over Detroit in 1988)LeBron James (27 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds in Cleveland’s Game 7 win at Golden State in 2016 to complete the Cavaliers’ comeback from a 3-1 series deficit against the 73-win Warriors)12For all the attention Willis Reed’s thigh injury in the 1970 finals understandably still gets, we can’t forget that knee surgery limited the Lakers’ Wilt Chamberlain to a career-low 12 games during the regular season. Chamberlain played the final three regular-season games after a four-month absence and then appeared in 18 games that postseason for the Lakers, averaging 22.1 points and 22.2 rebounds.
9Michael Jordan lost nine of his first 10 N.B.A. playoff games with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the Bulls to a playoff mark of 95-31 in winning six championships between 1991 and 1998, although he missed the 1993-94 N.B.A. season while playing Class AA baseball for the Birmingham Barons.
2With Jordan in uniform, Chicago was pushed to only two Game 7s in the 1990s and won both, outlasting the Knicks in the 1992 Eastern Conference semifinals and defeating Indiana in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals.
99.1The N.B.A. has instructed teams to refuse admittance to practice facilities for anyone who registers a temperature higher than 99.1 degrees. The threshold was 99.5 degrees for Taiwan’s Super Basketball League when it checked players as they entered the HaoYu Basketball Training Center during the S.B.L.’s recent playoffs.

637,791,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/12/21255887/anthony-fauci-warns-suffering-and-death-us-reopens-stay-at-home-orders-coronavirus-covid-19-economy,2020-05-12,Fauci warns of ‘suffering and death’ if US reopens too soon,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, is warning Congress that reopening the economy too soon during the coronavirus pandemic will result in “needless suffering and death.”

Fauci is among the health experts testifying Tuesday to a Senate panel. His testimony comes as President Donald Trump is praising states that are reopening after the prolonged lockdown aimed at controlling the virus’s spread.

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said as the hearing opened that “what our country has done so far in testing is impressive, but not nearly enough.”

Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force charged with shaping the response to COVID-19, which has killed tens of thousands of people in the U.S., is testifying via video conference after self-quarantining as a White House staffer tested positive for the virus.

With the U.S. economy in free-fall and more than 30 million people unemployed, Trump has been pressuring states to reopen.

Fauci, in a statement to The New York Times, warned that officials should adhere to federal guidelines for a phased reopening, including a “downward trajectory” of positive tests or documented cases of coronavirus over two weeks, robust contact tracing and “sentinel surveillance” testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.

“If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines ... then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,” Fauci wrote. “This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”

A recent Associated Press review determined that 17 states did not meet a key White House benchmark for loosening restrictions — a 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates. Yet many of those have begun to reopen or are about to do so, including Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah.

Of the 33 states that have had a 14-day downward trajectory of either cases or positive test rates, 25 are partially opened or moving to reopen within days, the AP analysis found. Other states that have not seen a 14-day decline, remain closed despite meeting some benchmarks.

Fauci put himself in quarantine after a White House staffer tested positive for the virus. Alexander also put himself in quarantine after an aide tested positive.

Besides Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health, the other experts include FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — both in self-quarantine—and Adm. Brett Giroir, the coronavirus “testing czar” at the Department of Health and Human Services.

The health committee hearing offers a very different setting from the White House coronavirus task force briefings the administration witnesses have all participated in. Most significantly, Trump will not be controlling the agenda.

Eyeing the November elections, Trump has been eager to restart the economy, urging on protesters who oppose their state governors’ stay-at-home orders and expressing his own confidence that the coronavrius will fade away as summer advances and Americans return to work and other pursuits.

The U.S. has seen at least 1.3 million infections and nearly 81,000 confirmed deaths from the virus, the highest toll in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Separately, one expert from the World Health Organization has already warned that some countries are “driving blind” into reopening their economies without having strong systems to track new outbreaks. And three countries that do have robust tracing systems — South Korea, Germany and China — have already seen new outbreaks after lockdown rules were relaxed.

WHO’s emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, said Germany and South Korea have good contact tracing that hopefully can detect and stop virus clusters before they get out of control. But he said other nations — which he did not name — have not effectively employed investigators to contact people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine before they can spread the virus.

“Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I’ve seen,” Ryan said. “Certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.”

Apple, Google, some U.S. states and European countries are developing contact-tracing apps that show whether someone has crossed paths with an infected person. But experts say the technology only supplements and does not replace labor-intensive human work.

U.S. contact tracing remains a patchwork of approaches and readiness levels. States are hiring contact tracers but experts say tens of thousands will be needed across the country.

Worldwide, the virus has infected nearly 4.2 million people and killed over 286,000, including more than 150,000 in Europe, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. Experts believe those numbers are too low for a variety of reasons.",real

The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure to keep production plants open.

The order comes after industry leaders warned that consumers could see meat shortages in a matter of days after workers at major facilities tested positive for the virus. A senior White House official said the administration was working to prevent a situation in which a majority of processing plants shut down for a period of time, which could lead to an 80% drop in the availability of meat in supermarkets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release.

Trump on Tuesday told reporters that “there’s plenty of supply,” but that supply chains had hit what he called a “road block. It’s sort of a legal roadblock more than anything else,” he said.

Two of the nation’s biggest pork processing plants are currently closed. Meat processing giant Tyson Foods suspended operations at its plant in Waterloo, Iowa. And Smithfield Foods halted production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The 15 largest pork-packing plants account for 60% of all pork processed in the country.

GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota had written a letter to Trump asking him to use the DPA to declare the food supply industry an essential industry, warning that consumers would see a meat shortage in a matter of days akin to the panic over toilet paper the virus created in its early days.

Tyson ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers Sunday outlining the difficulty of producing meat while keeping more than 100,000 workers safe and shutting some plants.

“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” it read.

The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million food and retail workers, said Tuesday that 20 U.S. food-processing and meatpacking union workers in the U.S. have died and that an estimated 6,500 are sick or have been exposed to the virus while working near someone who tested positive.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has infected hundreds of workers at meat-processing plants and forced some of the largest to close and others to slow production. While the output at beef and poultry plants has diminished, pork plants in the Midwest have been hit especially hard. The viral outbreaks have persisted despite efforts by the meat companies to keep workers at home with pay if they become sick.",real

656,1584,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/05/20/coronavirus-outbreak-is-cash-king/5227389002/,2020-05-20,"Cash, long a refuge in uncertain times, now under suspicion","Beirut — In troubled times, people have been known to hoard currency at home — a financial security blanket against deep uncertainty. But in this crisis, things are different. This time cash itself, passed from hand to hand across neighborhoods, cities and societies just like the coronavirus, is a source of suspicion rather than reassurance.

No longer a thing to be shoved mindlessly into a pocket, tucked into a worn wallet or thrown casually on a kitchen counter, money's status has changed during the virus era — perhaps irrevocably. The pandemic has also reawakened debate about the continued viability of what has been the physical lifeblood of global economies: paper money and coins.

From the supermarkets of the United States and Japan to the shantytowns of Africa to the gas stations of Tehran, a growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

In this March 19, 2020, file photo, Jorge Otero, owner of a fruit and vegetables stand, wears gloves as he exchanges cash with a customer, during a government curfew aimed at curbing cases of the new coronavirus in San Juan, Puerto Rico. (Photo: Carlos Giusti, AP)

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus from person to person through the use of money is minimal. That hasn't stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency, and some countries from urging citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

In the midst of the coronavirus era, a thousand calculations are made before cash is handled — mostly with gloved hands. Some leave the money laid out on surfaces for days, for the virus to die. Others disinfect banknotes with spray. Some even microwave them in the belief it kills the virus. In China, banks are now required to sterilize cash with ultraviolet light or heat, then store notes for at least a week before they are given to customers.

“In many areas, cash was already beginning to disappear due the increased risk of robbery, the ease of internet ordering, and the ubiquity of cell phones,” says Zachary Cohle, an assistant professor at the department of economics at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.

“Cash,” Cohle says, “now carries an extra stigma.”

But is ditching cash altogether even feasible?

Sweden, Finland, Norway, Canada and others have slowly phased out cash to the point where using it in large amounts seems suspicious. The United Kingdom and Australia are among countries expected to become cashless societies. And in China, use of cash by consumers has plunged as smartphone-based payment services rose in popularity over the past decade.

But for much of the rest of the world, letting go of cash is difficult if not impossible.

'Cash ist fesch!'

Humans have a centuries-old emotional relationship with physical money that is difficult to erase.

“Currency represents value that we can hold in our hands. Cash provides a way for us to translate a day’s work into something tangible and easily traded,” Cohle says. “We may not know what goods we will need in the future. However, holding money allows for us to feel as though we can buy whatever goods we will need.”

“Cash ist Fesch” is a common saying in Austria and southern Germany. The phrase, which literally means cash is beautiful, reflects both countries' attachment to cash — and not just among the older generation or those who worry about the loss of privacy that comes with cashless payments, but also among some younger people who see it as a status symbol.

“I always pay with cash — as a matter of principle!” Ingel Strobl, a 76-year-old pensioner, says while shopping at a bakery in central Vienna. “I know they want to abolish cash. But I don’t want that we lose our right to our own money. You know what I mean anyway! I stick to cash — corona or not.”’

Since the virus outbreak, however, shops that have remained open, like grocery stores, have posted signs encouraging people to pay with cards. Many are: According to Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, 43% of people have changed their payment behavior in the past few weeks; now, a large percentage are likely to make contactless payments with a card.

Japan, for its sophisticated reputation, is also a solid believer in cash, which makes up for 53% of a household’s assets, according to the Bank of Japan. The belief in “cash is king” reigns, though the country has had zero interest rates for two decades, far longer than the rest of the developed world.

But the threat of the coronavirus could be the impetus the nation needed to move toward going cashless, said Hiroki Maruyama, who heads the Fintech Association of Japan, a nonprofit that supports innovation in financial services.

“The culture,"" he says, ""is slowly changing.”

Cash in a crisis

“Cash combined with courage in a crisis is priceless,” billionaire investor Warren Buffett says.

In crisis-hit countries and parts of the world gripped by conflict or inflation, cash is still carried in thick wads for simple shopping expeditions.

In Lebanon, as the economic situation deteriorated late last year and the fear of banks collapsing mounted, many people began saving cash in their homes. The sale of home safes surged. An estimated $3 billion was withdrawn and stashed at home, according to the governor of the country's Central Bank.

As banks imposed capital controls, trips to the bank to withdraw foreign currency — followed by a trip to one of the ubiquitous exchange shops to change money on the black market — became the norm for many Lebanese.

“All I do is handle cash all day,” said one money changer in Beirut, who insisted on being identified by his first name, Ihsan. He said he feared unwanted attention from authorities.

“I wear gloves. But honestly? Corona is the last thing on people’s minds right now,"" Ihsan said. “All they’re thinking about is how to handle this crisis and get money to live.”

In this May, 2, 2020, photo, a man uses banknotes to pay for his purchases at the mall in Basra, Iraq. (Photo: Nabill al-Jurani, AP)

In Iran, one of the world’s worst coronavirus hotspots, there are no international bank cards, like Visa or Mastercard, because of U.S. sanctions. Many were surprised at the new banners that appeared at some gas stations in Tehran: “Service is only for those who will pay by debit cards.”

In Venezuela, it is common to see bolivars littering the streets because the local currency has lost its value.

“The truth is that I haven’t had any bolivars in my wallet for a long time,” said Fátima Figueras, a 32-year-old office worker, waiting in line to enter a Caracas pharmacy. “What worries me most is having to hand my debit card to a cashier who touches it,” said Figueras, wearing a facemask against the coronavirus.

Cash still rules in West and Central Africa even with the growth in regional banking options and mobile money service providers. Monthly banking account fees are prohibitive for many, and the self-employed often keep their savings at home in hard currency. ATM machines often don’t work.

Dorothy Harpool, director of student and community initiatives and lecturer at Wichita State University's W. Frank Barton School of Business, predicted the pandemic would lead some consumers to rethink their use of cash. But going completely cashless, she says, is a long way off.

“Until everyone and every country has reliable access to the internet, I do not believe the pandemic will singularly change past practices,” Harpool said. In particular, cash transactions are also likely to remain for businesses operating under the radar of government and other regulatory bodies.

Ihsan, the Beirut money changer, said there are certain things you just can’t do without cash — particularly in a dysfunctional and developing nation.

“Like how else can you bribe a government employee to get your business done? With a credit card?”

657,253,https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/2020/4/6/21209322/chicago-cubs-white-sox-blackhawks-bulls-bears-we-are-not-playing-coronavirus-lori-lightfoot,2020-04-06,"Chicago sports teams, Mayor Lori Lightfoot say ‘We Are Not Playing’ to support coronavirus stay-at-home orders","All eight of Chicago’s major-league professional sports teams signed on to a new public information campaign with a motto that would’ve been unthinkable in any year but 2020: “We Are Not Playing.”

The new campaign, announced Monday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s office, is intended to support the stay-at-home order in place throughout Illinois and most of the rest of the United States.

“I am grateful to each of our hometown teams for stepping up and doing their part by joining in this call for every neighborhood and community,” Lightfoot said in a press conference at Soldier Field. “They’re not playing, and neither are we. The more we stay home and act responsibly, the more lives we’ll save.”

The campaign will be spread on digital and physical billboards throughout the area, then move onto online and social media channels, per a press release.

“This is a disease that doesn’t discriminate. It really doesn’t,” Lightfoot said. “And young people—I remember back in the day thinking nothing could stop me. That I was invincible. If we can get credible messengers like sports athletes who can really reach sports fans, but also young people in particular — that’s why we’re activating this group of people. We know that they have cache. We know that they have reach.”

Easily recognizable athletes from every team — including Jonathan Toews of the Blackhawks, Jason Heyward of the Cubs, Eloy Jimenez of the White Sox and Coby White of the Bulls — will participate with videos and messages encouraging Chicagoans to stay home.

“Sports has always served as a great example of achieving a common goal and overcoming the odds,” Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said. “If we can all do our part to follow public health guidelines to stay at home, we can slow or stop the spread of this disease. Stay inside so that we can come together and watch baseball soon.”

Although no pro sports have taken place in the city in weeks, the motto is still jarring during a time where nearly every Chicago team would normally be either in-season or gearing up for it.

The Cubs were initially scheduled to have finished a six-game homestand Sunday and start a series in Pittsburgh on Monday. The White Sox were supposed to host the Mariners in a Monday matinee, starting their own series.

The Blackhawks would’ve just concluded their regular season Saturday against the Rangers, and the Fire would’ve hosted the Red Bulls that same day. The Bulls would be starting a pair of Staples Center road games, Monday against the Clippers and Wednesday against the Lakers, with two home games left on the schedule.

And the Sky and Red Stars would have been anticipating their season openers a few weeks away.

Lightfoot was asked about the possibility of professional football and other major sporting events resuming without fans in the stands.

“We’re not at that point yet. But, I know that the various sports leagues are talking about a variety of different options, depending on how long the public health personnel believe that we need to be reducing the size of crowds,” she said.

Instead, the entire Chicago sports scene — along with much of the rest of the city — is paused indefinitely.

Monday’s campaign announcement seeks to translate that blatantly obvious reality into day-to-day behavior changes for fans of the seven teams, emphasizing self-isolation activities that will flatten the curve over time and limit the burden on the city’s overloaded medical system.

“For every sports team in Chicago, our fans have been there for us, in both good times and bad,” White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said. “The teams receive so much support from our fans that it is our responsibility to give back whenever and however we can.”

“As far as time-outs go, none are more important to our fans than this one,” Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz added. “All of us need to listen to the experts by staying off the field of play and stay at home. We owe that to ourselves, but we especially owe it the people that do not have that stay-at-home option, beginning with our front-line responders.”",real
658,947,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/14/21258893/abbott-labs-covid19-tests-white-house-new-york-university,2020-05-14,"Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns","The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.

The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.

In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.

The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.

“We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,” Dr. Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

“We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test. This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes. Negative results may need to be confirmed with a high-sensitivity authorized molecular test.”

Abbott: Study flawed

Abbott, headquartered in Lake County near North Chicago, said the NYU study is flawed.

“We’re seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used,” the company said in a statement. “In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies. While we’ve seen a few studies with sensitivity performance percentages in the 80s, we’ve also seen other studies with sensitivity at or above 90%, and one as high as 94%.

“While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,” Abbott said.

That test compared findings between two systems: the Abbott ID NOW and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress. The samples were obtained from 101 patients with COVID-19 symptoms seeking treatment at New York University’s Langone Tisch Hospital.

In using one kind of nasal swab and liquid to store the sample, the “Abbot ID NOW COVID-19 missed a third of the samples detected positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress” with the rate going to 48% using a different type of nasal swab, the study found.

Though the FDA acknowledged it was aware of some studies that have raised concern over the accuracy of Abbott’s device, the agency said in the statement it “is investigating whether it could be due to the types of swabs used or the type of viral transport media.”

Rapid testing is seen as key to easing stay-at-home orders and Abbott’s ID NOW was one of the first on the market.

Some inaccurate negative results

The Abbott ID NOW system also has the advantage that the machine used to analyze samples is about the size of a toaster and can be used anywhere.

Abbott and the FDA are currently working to analyze the information that has been gathered and to alert users that any negative results that aren’t consistent with a patient’s symptoms or signs should be confirmed with another test.

The FDA is now reviewing 15 “adverse reports” about the device which “suggest some users are receiving inaccurate negative results.” Abbott has also agreed to conduct post-market studies of the device that will include at least 150 COVID-19 patients in various clinical settings.

The FDA granted Abbott emergency use authorization — known as EUA — for the test on March 27. Abbott said in a release when the ID NOW went on the market, the “ID NOW COVID-19 rapid point-of-care test can provide test results in 13 minutes or less. Early detection can accelerate care, reduce viral spread and help people get on the road to recovery sooner.”

Physician here had doubts

At least one local physician has been hesitant to use the scrutinized Abbott test even before the new study.

When Dr. Rahul Khare started offering coronavirus testing at his clinic in Lincoln Park, he opted to use polymerase chain reaction tests that he sends to an outside lab for processing. Though it takes about three days to get results back, Khare didn’t even consider using the speedier Abbott test

“I’m very particular about the tests I use and I know the technology of that test because it’s the same technology that I’ve used for Abbott rapid flu and strep [tests]. And I just know they’re not very good for a variety of reasons,” said Khare, founder of Innovative Express Care.

“It’s a very specific thing that happens: When you use a DNA amplifier, the problem is if you don’t get an adequate amount of the specimen, it makes it invalid. And on top of that, I know that that’s just not as best of a technology as PCR.”",real
663,3,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/novel-coronavirus-cases-confirmed-be-spreading/,2020-01-24,Novel Coronavirus Cases Confirmed To Be Spreading,"The first two coronavirus cases in Europe have been detected in France, and a second case has been confirmed in America as China expands its efforts to control its outbreak.

Travel bans have been put in place and extended from central China to effectively put tens of millions of people in local lockdown. The virus was first detected in Wuhan where workers are racing to build a thousand bed hospital to treat patients affected by the disease.

All around China, including in the capital Beijing authorities are cancelling all temple fairs and festivals that would accompany the Spring Festival to avoid having large public gathering which would create the perfect scenario for the airborne virus to spread further.

More than 830 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed, at least 26 people have died, and another 8,420 people are reported by be under quarantine and observation for possible infection after a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from people who attended a seafood market in Wuhan on Dec.31.2019, ten days later the full genomic sequence of virus was made public.

A young healthy man from Wuhan has died raising concerns regarding the deadliness of the virus as up until then the vast majority of victims have been over the age of 60 with preexisting conditions.

A lockdown is being enforced across large parts of the province of Hubei affecting over 35 million estimated people. The chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak as seen in the reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed medical workers, and dwindling supplies.

Two cases have now been confirmed in France by the French health minister, one being in the city of Bordeaux and the other in Paris, both patients were recently in China and authorities suspect that more cases will likely emerge.

There are concerns that people may be contagious with the virus even before exhibiting symptoms, and panic has spread along with the disease with most reactions being based on partial or misinformation making the matter worse. Without clear updates coming from official sources, rumors and misinformation commonly spread rapidly via sources such as social media.

“We have to get serious about the threat of coronavirus coming from China. I don’t trust Communist China to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner,” Senator Rick Scott said in a statement. “I’m calling on the administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.”

Taiwan has also confirmed its first case of the coronavirus this week, and convened a high level meeting to discuss the outbreak and called upon W.H.O not to exclude their country. “Taiwan has been on the front line of fighting previous disease outbreak in the region from SARS to swine flu,” Longman Chung, a representative of TECRO wrote in the email.

A case was recently detected in a Chinese national living in Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan; the man returned from Wuhan, was hospitalized, has recovered and been discharged. The man said that he did not visit the seafood market in Wuhan that also sells live animals and other meats, according to the CDC he may have come in contact with an infected person while there which raises the possibility of human to human transmission.

In Washington senators attended a special briefing with health officials to hear the latest developments of the outbreak. Public health authorities acted quickly in Illinois after a case emerged Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said “They identified, isolated and did contact tracing on the people with whom that person came into contact,” he said. “That’s how you get your handle on an outbreak.” But he said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if there are additional cases.”

“We are monitoring the outbreak of a novel coronavirus closely and are in close communication with United States government agencies on actions and precautions needed to prevent further spread of this virus,” the senators said. “The Chinese government has taken steps to share information with international health experts, and we encourage their cooperation and transparency as this situation unfolds,” they said. “We will continue to work closely with administration officials to ensure the United States is prepared to respond.”

American officials are assessing the extent and duration of screening travelers in the USA who have come from Wuhan at San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, and Chicago airports. The lockdown in China means that fewer travelers will be arriving from there to America. A labor intensive airport screening is being conducted by the CDC, but sick patients with no symptoms may not be detected.

Martin Cetron, director of global migration and quarantine at the CDC says to help control the spread of the coronavirus resources need to be focused on state and local levels, where frontline health officials are trying to identify cases.

According to W.H.O officials are developing contingency plans for the outbreak that could very well last for months and infect thousands of people as there are still many unknowns about the novel virus, its trajectories, transmission and symptoms. What is clear is that the number of cases will rise.

The CDC has deployed a team to Chicago to help official after a woman was diagnosed with the virus. Officials expect to see more cases: “Although the outbreak is a very serious public health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

In both confirmed American cases in Seattle and Chicago the patients were not displaying any symptoms until they returned on their flights from the Wuhan area; both began to feel unwell and contacted healthcare providers right away. There may also be a case of infection in Texas.

“The Brazos County Health District said Thursday the patient traveled to Texas from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated, but that they didn’t yet know their path home and if that path took them through the heavily trafficked Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport or Bush Intercontinental in Houston,” reports an NBC affiliate in Dallas, Texas.

“Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis,” the CDC said in an earlier statement.

Washington health officials said in a statement that the man had returned from visiting a region near Wuhan, China, he landed at Seattle’s international airport last Wednesday. Feeling ill soon after, he reached out to his healthcare provider on Sunday. In a statement, Washington state health officials said, “Human to human spread has been confirmed. How easily or sustainably this virus is spreading remains unknown.”

Early studies of the viral genome suggest a molecular similarity to SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 that sickened over 8,000 people and killed 774. This new virus stems from a family of pathogens long thought to be relatively benign and typically causing a common cold. During the SARS outbreak it took 20 months from the time of getting the genome of the first virus to a clinical trial, it now takes around 3.5 months for other viral diseases.

According to the CDC there are currently no vaccines against the coronavirus, you may be able to reduce the risk of infection by frequently washing your hands while in public and immediately when you return home; avoid touching your person and food with unwashed hands; and avoid close contact with those that are sick.

Additionally there are no specific treatments, most will recover on their own, you may be able to relieve symptoms by using a room humidifier, drinking plenty of liquids, and staying at home to rest.

Russia reported 9,263 new infections on Tuesday, pushing its nationwide total to 299,941, and 115 more deaths, taking the total death toll to 2,837. Only the United States has reported more coronavirus cases.

The new cases were for a fourth successive day below 10,000. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Monday Russia had halted the growth in infections and that there were other positive signs.

Mishustin, one of four government ministers to catch the coronavirus, has been discharged from a clinic and is now working normally, the Interfax news agency quoted his spokesman as saying on Tuesday.

The U.S. embassy in Moscow said Russian President Vladimir Putin had requested assistance from the United States and that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to send 200 U.S.-made ventilators.

The presidents spoke by telephone on May 7.

A first batch of 50 ventilators should be ready for shipment on Wednesday, while the remaining 150 will be ready shortly after, the embassy said in a statement.

Russia sent a batch of its own ventilators to the United States in early April, but U.S. officials say they were not needed in the end.

The Russian ventilator in question, the Aventa-M, came into the spotlight last week after it was reported to have caused fires in hospital in Moscow and St Petersburg.

That prompted Russia to suspend the use of Aventa-M ventilators produced after April 1.",real

Russia is going to see four scenarios with the development of the coronavirus pandemic. The most probable one of them is described as push-and-pull: repeated waves of morbidity and a string of quarantines until 2021.

Experts at the international consulting company Boston Consulting Group (BCG) believe that according to one of the four scenarios, the virus would be stopped, and the crisis would be limited to only one wave. In this case, the country will lose 4-6% of GDP. Non-food retail businesses and services would be suspended as a result of the lockdown, which may last for about two months in each region. Businesses will recover quickly after the lockdown ends. However, many small businesses will close, which will increase the level of unemployment.

Under the critical recession scenario, Russia will lose 10-15% of GDP. The virus crisis will last longer, and the country will see stringent quarantine measures. Industrial production and construction will stop, which will lead to a decrease in demand for resources, primarily hydrocarbons and steel. A large-scale liquidity crisis will begin throughout the Russian economy, which will put an excessive burden on the banking system.

Another scenario would be similar to the period, in which Russia found herself in the early 1990s after the collapse of the USSR. In this scenario, the world will see long-term recession in global economy, but BCG experts do not see any prerequisites for it.

In the most plausible scenario of quarantine cycles, Russia's GDP will decline by 7-10% compared to 5%, which the Central Bank and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov predicted. Bursts of morbidity are possible before the end of 2021, because the coronavirus vaccine will be released no earlier than in late 2020.

A long lockdown will lead to numerous bankruptcies in small and medium-sized businesses. In this scenario, the government will be opening and closing the economy depending on the incidence rate. Long-term lockdown will lead to further decline in the sector of services and retail, a drop in demand for real estate and a decrease in production and wholesale trade.

Experts recommend the Russian authorities expand the capacity of medical institutions after quarantine ends, make quarantine more predictable and shorter, and use decisive measures to support the economy during lockdown. If quarantines are short enough (less than 25% of the total pandemic period), it would be cheaper for the state to subsidize wages during this period rather than to support a sharply increased number of unemployed people.",fake

As the first major sports league in the world to return during the coronavirus pandemic, some hope it could provide a roadmap for the U.S.' major leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and others.

""Every little thing about what Germany has done should be watched very closely by U.S. sports,"" Grant Wahl, a leading soccer journalist and author of ""Masters of Modern Soccer,"" told CBS News' Roxana Saberi.

Many Bundesliga teams resumed training in April after regular games were sidelined in March over COVID-19 and players were sent into quarantine.

One team, Dynamo Dresden, has already had to delay its start after two players tested positive for the virus and forced the entire team into a 14-day lockdown.

The return to the pitch will have some noticeable changes, starting with teams' entrances. A single team will have to ride in on multiple busses to observe social distancing rules.

At games, coaches and substitutes not in play will have to wear face masks.

Players on the field have been told they can make physical contact as part of the game, but the hugging and celebratory embraces that come with scoring a goal are no longer allowed.

""We have to think about this, what we could do, because sometimes automatically you go to your teammate to celebrate the goal,"" Robert Lewandowski, striker for Bundesliga's Bayern Munich team, said.

The stands will also be noticeably quiet, with live fans banned for the rest of the season. Some will be paying to have cardboard cutouts of themselves sitting in stadiums instead.

""We of course will miss spectators, and therefore of course it's important, but it's not the time for wishes and dreams,"" said Carsten Cramer, managing director of the team Borussia Dortmund.

Although soccer fans may be excited, opinions in Germany are split. As the country eases its strict pandemic lockdown, a recent poll suggests just over half of respondents oppose the return of soccer matches.",real

About 100 newborns are stranded nationwide because their foreigner parents can't enter the country after it closed its borders during the pandemic.

Fifty-one of those babies are in Kiev's Venice Hotel, being cared for by BioTexCom, Ukraine's largest surrogacy clinic. Footage of rows of tightly-packed bassinets brought attention to this issue.

Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman, is concerned that extending the quarantine, which is currently set to end on May 22, will impact thousands of babies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nearly 100 surrogate-born babies are stranded in Ukraine because their parents are unable to collect them due to border closures imposed because of the coronavirus.

As one of the few countries that grants foreigners this service, Ukraine boasts a robust surrogacy industry. It's an option that appeals to Ukrainian women because of the nation's economic woes, the Associated Press reported. A surrogate mother can earn about $17,000, Sky News said.

Around 50 clinics conduct surrogate births nationwide. However, this usually thriving trade has hit a snag during the pandemic, prompting concerns that an extended lockdown will put pressure on clinics and be difficult for parents, who hail from 12 countries, including the United States, Britain, China, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and Mexico, AP said.

This has prompted Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, to seek help from authorities.

""About 100 children are already waiting for their parents in different centers of reproductive medicine. And if quarantine is extended, then it will not be about hundreds, but about thousands,"" ombudswoman Lyudmila Denisova said, according to AP.

As of Friday, Ukraine has 17,330 confirmed coronavirus cases and 476 deaths, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.

The country shut down its borders to foreigners in March and these restrictions are expected to remain in place till May 22.

The issue garnered attention when BioTexCom, Ukraine's largest surrogacy clinic, shared footage of rows of bassinets in Kiev's Venice Hotel, where clients usually stay, AP reported. In all, BioTexCom is caring for 51 newborns, Denisova said, adding that an additional 15 babies are with parents who were able to enter Ukraine before the shutdown.

""The children are all provided with food, a sufficient number of employees look after them, but there is no substitute for parental care,"" Denis Herman, the company's lawyer, said to Sky News. ""We try to send photos of children to the parents, we try to make conference calls, but this cannot replace communication in direct contact.""

Parents will only be allowed into Ukraine if the relevant embassy receives a request to that effect, government officials told Sky News.

""The issue remains unresolved, but we are developing a mechanism to get out of the situation,"" Denisova said to AP on Thursday. This would involve foreigners issuing statements to Denisova's office, which would then reach out to the Foreign Ministry.

Rafa Aires was among the few who were able to get into Ukraine to collect his daughter, Marta, before the lockdown was enforced. Now, however, he can't get home, Sky News reported.

His wife is back home in Spain because work prevented her from traveling.

""Every day I make video calls with my wife for one hour or an hour and a half for her to see the baby,"" Aires said. ""It is very difficult.""

BioTexCom's ""wonderful"" nurses and medical staff have been of tremendous help, he added.

However, according to Denisova, BioTexCom's images spotlight a ""massive and systemic"" surrogacy industry with babies being advertised as a ""high-quality product,"" Sky News said. She wants Ukrainian law to be modified to reserve surrogacy for citizens.

In response, BioTexCom's founder Albert Tochilovsky said, ""We were prepared for this negative reaction.""

690,503,https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/what-we-dont-know-about-covid-19,2020-04-29,What We Don’t Know About the Coronavirus,"COVID-19 has been shown to damage multiple organ systems, including the lungs, the heart, the kidneys, and the brain.

We think of COVID-19 as a disease of the respiratory tract. When future generations look back on this pandemic, its iconic symbol will probably be the ventilator. But, although respiratory problems are at the core of the disease, COVID-19 has revealed itself to be more than a straightforward viral pneumonia. Doctors around the world—including in the emergency department where we work, at Mount Sinai Hospital, in Manhattan—have learned the hard way that the coronavirus doesn’t confine its ravages to the lungs. COVID-19 can push kidneys into failure, send the body’s immune system into catastrophic overdrive, and cause blood clots that impede circulation to the lungs, heart, or brain. It’s a disease of remarkable complexity, which even the most experienced doctors are struggling to understand.

On blogs, podcasts, and #medtwitter, members of the medical community have been trading stories and theories about COVID-19’s intricacies. Often, their conversation has followed the methodology of critical-care doctors. Physicians who work in I.C.U.s tend to talk not about symptoms or diseases—chest pain, diabetes—but about organ systems, which can malfunction and interact in complex ways. System by system, a picture of COVID-19 is emerging. Clarifying it may mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people in the months to come.

The shortness of breath that’s most characteristic of COVID-19 is reasonably well understood. It originates in the gossamer air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli, where blood and air are separated by such thin membranes that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass into and out of the bloodstream, respectively. Between them, the lungs have somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred million alveoli. Severe COVID-19 causes many of them to either collapse or fill with fluid. The virus attacks the cells lining the alveoli; our overactive immune systems, in trying to fight the virus, may be damaging them as well. The result is that not enough oxygen gets into the blood.

Doctors trying to solve this problem have two basic tools at their disposal: oxygen and pressure. They can give patients concentrated oxygen beyond the usual twenty-one per cent that is found in normal air. Alternatively, using a CPAP machine or ventilator, they can create a kind of sustained air pressure within the lungs—“positive end-expiratory pressure,” or PEEP—which keeps the alveoli open, and thus more receptive to oxygen, at moments when the lungs would ordinarily be emptier of air. (Imagine breathing in and out while leaning through the window of a moving car: that lungs-full-of-air feeling is PEEP.) Doctors have also been improving oxygenation by “proning” patients—that is, periodically turning them onto their stomachs. Such positioning takes advantage of gravity to match areas of air-filled lung with areas of higher blood flow.

All this makes straightforward mechanical sense. Still, mysteries hover around the certainties. Doctors track the “oxygen saturation” of patients with COVID-19—they monitor the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the bloodstream that are currently carrying oxygen. Ordinarily, in patients with healthy lungs, an oxygen-saturation level below ninety per cent is cause for grave concern: when vital organs such as the heart and brain become starved for oxygen, the risk of death skyrockets. But doctors are finding, bizarrely, that some COVID-19 patients can remain subjectively comfortable even when their saturation levels fall far below these ranges. This “silent hypoxemia” is frightening for physicians, who associate such low numbers with imminent death. And it’s deeply mystifying, since the numbers seem implausible.

Is silent hypoxemia a sign that, even though a patient feels relatively well, the bottom is about to drop out? Or is the virus somehow interfering with the blood’s hemoglobin, or with the parts of the brain that warn us when we need more oxygen? Theories abound. Meanwhile, silent hypoxemia complicates the decision to intubate. In the early days of COVID-19 treatment, low oxygen saturation that failed to improve was generally seen as an indication that intubation was necessary right away. But in early March reports of comfortable patients with discordantly low saturation rates began spreading rapidly among doctors online. One particularly arresting image, posted on Twitter by a New York City emergency-medicine physician, shows a patient calmly reading on her phone while her overhead monitor reveals a saturation rate of just fifty-four per cent. Until we better understand the physiology behind silent hypoxemia, and why some people experience it and others do not, we will have no choice but to live with the mystery, scrutinizing some patients who have oxygen levels in the seventies and eighties, and whom we might have rushed to intubate in the past.

Within hours of a viral invasion, the body’s immune system swings into action. The “innate” immune system, which recognizes protein structures common to many pathogens, reacts first, by releasing a family of chemical distress signals called cytokines. They spread from the site of the infection, instructing the body to raise its temperature and divert blood flow to the affected area; they also activate other immune-system cells, which begin developing antibodies specifically targeting the invaders. Without cytokines, the immune system would slumber while infections wreak havoc. But the cytokine system has a weakness. Some pathogens can provoke it in a perverse way, so that it goads the immune system as a whole into overdrive. In what’s known as a cytokine storm, fever and inflammation spike out of control. It’s unclear why some patients might experience this phenomenon while others do not.

Faced with a cytokine storm in a patient, a doctor can try to modulate the immune system’s response. The problem is striking the right balance. While some patients may benefit from a degree of medically induced immunosuppression, there are others for whom such an intervention could cause great harm. Some hospitals have begun cautiously administering steroids or drugs that inhibit the cytokine IL-6. But high-quality clinical-trial data about such treatments won’t be ready for a long time. Moreover, even if early results are encouraging, we will still have to distinguish between those patients who will benefit from immunosuppression and those who won’t. In the past, physicians have interpreted elevated blood levels of the protein ferritin as a sign that a cytokine storm is in progress. Some are now using that analysis in the treatment of COVID-19. Only time will tell if they’re right.",real

Among the most promising, yet also controversial: new smartphone applications that perform contact tracing, currently under construction by private companies and government agencies.

The idea of sharing information about our lives with strangers or the government has, understandably, raised significant fears about surveillance and privacy. (The editorial board at the journal Nature recently called for “a cast-iron commitment from governments that the information being harvested is secure and will only ever be used for the reasons it is being requested.”)

Martin-dm/Getty Images More

Knowing how smartphone-based contact tracing apps work, however, and how they can exchange information without revealing our identities, will enable us to embrace this potentially life-saving technology— and make sure we hold app providers accountable for our right to privacy.

Contact tracing is exactly what it sounds like: After someone is diagnosed with a contagious disease, a trained public health worker interviews that person, then takes steps to identify and reach out to all those who came in contact with the infected individual. This approach is time-consuming and error prone; identifying all possible contacts depends on records and memory, and individuals may be likely to overlook unmemorable encounters (such as standing in line at the grocery store, passing someone on the sidewalk, etc.).

Today’s smartphones however, can supplement manual contact tracing with applications that notify you if you’ve been near someone with a positive diagnosis.

GPS-based tracking: Most smartphones already have highly accurate location-tracking capabilities in the form of GPS, or Global Positioning System. Digital contact-tracing apps that rely on GPS (like those being used in places like Norway, Hong Kong and even South Dakota) can create second-by-second records of our precise location, to within 16 feet. Your GPS record is compared to those of infected individuals to see if you, quite literally, crossed paths during an infected individual’s contagious period. While these location-based apps may prove effective in identifying physical contacts, this detailed and specific physical location data is not something anyone ought to feel comfortable releasing to others.

Bluetooth systems: For this reason, various companies and government agencies around the world are racing to build new contact-tracing apps that rely instead on your smartphone’s Bluetooth radio, with several already available in Australia and the U.K., and more emerging every day.

Bluetooth technology, which is also readily available on most smartphones, has two distinct technical functions: advertising and listening. When Bluetooth is “advertising,” your phone emits short, digital “chirps” (called beacons) that can be received by other Bluetooth devices that are “listening” nearby. In everyday uses, these inaudible chirps allow personal devices to discover each other. Your earbuds and smartwatch get connected this way, and your phone becomes a hands-free device after it hears the chirps emitted by your car. Most often, your phone is a listener: It receives chirps from other devices and, after connecting, can receive information (like a podcast or a record of your workout).",real
693,1161,https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/the-trump-campaign-brings-its-angry-tone-to-the-coronavirus-era,2020-05-16,The Trump Campaign Brings Its Angry Tone to the Coronavirus Era,"Donald Trump, Jr., the President’s eldest son, thinks that his father is getting a raw deal. In a recent appearance on “Team Trump Online”—a nightly video series that serves as a substitute for campaign rallies and often attracts more than a million viewers—he complained that his father is having to wage war against “the deep-state guys” and unchecked attacks from “influencers on the other side.” He said that each reporter at the White House briefings “has an agenda, and that is to destroy Donald Trump.” Joe Biden “can’t remember where he is fifty per cent of the time,” Trump, Jr., said, but he can count on the “media lackeys” who are the “marketing wing of the Democrat Party.” The Democrats, he added, are “becoming the party of socialism and communism.” That includes Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib—“you know, the Hamas caucus in Congress.” As for the COVID-19 outbreak, which has caused more than eighty thousand deaths in the U.S. to date, he said, “China basically screwed the whole world.”

Venom and victimization largely define the President’s public persona, and the same holds true for the online campaign. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early March, and the COVID-19 pandemic put a halt to barnstorming a few weeks later, but the rhetoric of Trump’s campaign has barely budged. On March 12th, as the coronavirus crisis was taking hold in the United States, it e-mailed its supporters a photograph of Trump, ruddy face fully made up, a flag pin in his lapel, sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, looking steely. The e-mail said that there is “no room for partisanship, and the President is calling on both parties in Congress to unite.” The very next day, when Trump declared a national emergency, the campaign reverted to form, blasting “Sleepy Joe” and “Crazy Bernie.” Last weekend, after the Justice Department dropped its charges against Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national-security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the campaign crowed, in a fund-raising text, “Justice for Gen Flynn! A WITCH HUNT from day 1! ALL GIFTS TRIPLED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.”

Anyone who has attended Trump’s rallies, where thousands of fans in MAGA hats whoop and cheer at his insults and diatribes, can attest that the President, ever a showman, knows how to play to his target audiences. And, yet, as Biden edges into the lead in key states, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, pollsters and political strategists are questioning whether Trump’s perennial pitch can carry him to victory on November 3rd. His political base is loyal but narrow. When Democrats scored heavily in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms, and captured a majority in the House of Representatives, it was women voters who made the difference. A recent Quinnipiac poll in Florida showed Trump lagging behind Biden among women, and also among two groups that delivered crucial support in 2016: voters over the age of sixty-five and voters who dislike both candidates. When I asked Douglas Schwartz, the director of the Quinnipiac poll, about the survey, he said that Biden does better among both groups on honesty, leadership, and empathy. “These numbers are a warning sign for his campaign,” Schwartz said of the President.

The Trump campaign brags about an army of field organizers, the cell-phone numbers of tens of millions of supporters, and a new app that connects voters to news, virtual events, and volunteer opportunities, from fund-raising to voter registration. Each is a significant upgrade from Trump’s 2016 effort, which relied on his outsized personality, his televised rallies, and the power of social media. The current operation, led by Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s successful Facebook marketing campaign in 2016, has raised more than seven hundred and thirty million dollars. In cash-on-hand, Biden lags tens of millions of dollars behind. “It’s not like a campaign of grievance and anger and fear hasn’t been a pillar of American politics since there was an American politics,” Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on Barack Obama’s Presidential campaigns, said. “That’s exactly how Trump won.” Republicans are right to be worried, Belcher added, but even as Trump struggles to expand his base COVID-19 and the plunging economy are making predictions difficult. “Given that environment, where people are afraid and anxious—and understandably so—can you count out a candidate peddling grievance and fear?”

In hundreds of different versions of its standard pitch, Trump’s campaign complains, boasts, and beseeches. The President, his surrogates, and the campaign staff spray a familiar buckshot of belittling nicknames and insults at a cast that includes “Sleepy Joe,” “Crazy Bernie,” and “Crooked Hillary,” who were recently joined by “Cheatin’ Obama.” An e-mail on Monday, targeting Biden, asked supporters to “show the Left that you REJECT their corrupt candidate,” while one on Friday called Biden “a certified CROOK.” During a recent “Team Trump Online” broadcast, Parscale bragged about “a roll of Hillary Clinton toilet paper that I use every time I’m in a bad mood. I have boxes of it, and I take it into the bathroom, and it’s just enjoyable.”

Another regular target is the “Lamestream” media, the “enemy of the people,” ever in cahoots with “the Radical Left-wing MOB.” Together, Trump warned in an e-mail earlier this year, these elements are pushing a “non-stop propaganda campaign of LIES to try and destroy me.” With nary a mention of his own wealthy backers, Trump slams “the establishment,” along with the “Hollywood elite” and “foreign enemies,” declaring, in one solicitation, “They all HATE you, and that’s why they want to steal your vote. It’s US against THEM.” The April 27th “Team Trump Online” session was led by Katrina Pierson, a former Tea Party activist, whose guests included Representative Dan Crenshaw, a military veteran from Texas. She described Barack Obama as a “faint-hearted” Commander-in-Chief, while Crenshaw told viewers that Democrats “will lie through their teeth. They’re doing it all the time.”

In its texts and e-mails, the campaign seeks donations and valuable voter contact information by offering a steady supply of Trump-branded merchandise, from football jerseys, Christmas ornaments, and doormats to plastic straws, a swipe at liberal locales that have been banning them to help the environment. The offers have continued unabated during the COVID-19 crisis. Last Saturday, the campaign wrote supporters to say Trump knows that recent weeks have been “extremely difficult for Americans from all across the Nation.” The e-mail said that the President is grateful for “your unwavering support” and wants to do “something special for you to show how much your loyalty means to him.” The message continued, “He’s asked us to give you EXCLUSIVE ACCESS to get our Official Trump-Pence Pint Glasses.” The cost for a set: thirty-one dollars. “But, we have an extremely limited supply, so we can only hold them until 11:59 PM TONIGHT.”

I asked David Sable, the former head of the marketing agency Y. & R., to assess the Trump campaign as a marketing effort. “His base loves it,” said Sable, who explained that Trump has “brand power” derived from what he called the “brand experience,” which is part show, part substance. “The key is to get those people to recruit other people. If you can do that, you’re way ahead of the game. That’s basically the way the guy operates,” Sable said. According to Sable, Trump’s team, to its credit, “understands simplicity.” The “Make America Great Again” message, in 2016, was straightforward, and so is the “Keep America Great” message in 2020, according to Sable: “At the end of the day, I’ve done a great job, I will continue to do a great job, and I will fix this to get back to the great job I was doing.”",real

He had a May 3 gig at City Winery lined up where he planned on jamming with some of Chicago’s blues luminaries.

The coronavirus pandemic has all but wiped that out — indefinitely.

And last week, the city canceled the 37th annual Chicago Blues Fest, which was scheduled for June 5-7 — an announcement that sounded like a death knell to many of the city’s blues artists.

“I’m grateful to be turning 50, but I’m so sad about me not being able to ring it in like it was planned,” said Brooks. “Man, this is horrible. … And we definitely got the blues right now; everybody in the world got the blues right now.”

Brooks, the son of blues legend Lonnie Brooks, had a big summer of touring ahead. Like other Chicago area artists in the genre, he wants to keep the blues alive. Over the years, he’s performed with the likes of Buddy Guy, Koko Taylor, Bo Diddley, Taj Mahal and Otis Clay.

“Every single day, I’m getting a cancellation and it’s very disheartening,” said Brooks. “This is my main source of income, which is live touring.

“But for the most part, I have no income coming in. … So, as a musician, I’m definitely sick and I’m in a boat that is sinking.”

Blues guitarist Joanna Connor, a full-time musician for almost four decades, has done a series of online concerts and Q&A sessions since the pandemic took all of her gigs away.

“It’s been a good life but it’s not like I had piles of money put away; I was kind of living gig to gig,” said Connor. “I just made a record and that’s been put on hold, and so everything’s kind of suspended at this point, you know.

“I’m getting like 12,000 views in a few days, so I think it’s speaking to people who get the realness of the music because we’re in a situation.”

Gary, Indiana, blues singer and guitarist Donald Kinsey, an original member of The Wailers — reggae singer Bob Marley’s band — says blues musicians will continue to roll with the punches because the genre often documents when people are down on their luck.

“One thing for sure, there’s gonna be a lot of songs to come from this,” said Kinsey. “That’s what we do with songwriters and musicians and so, you know, we look forward to being able to get back out and do what we do: traveling and move people’s spirits.”

Some of the venues where many of the city’s blues artists plied their trade continue to do fundraisers. A GoFundMe account for Kingston Mines says the famed Lincoln Park club might close for good without more cash, while Logan Square’s Rosa’s Lounge is providing a platform for artists to perform online videos and solicit donations through its Facebook fan page.

Blues Fest usually brings a bump in revenue — but not this summer.

“The only revenue I can generate is when you [patrons] come to us; it’s 100 percent of our revenue, “ said Tony Mangiullo, Rosa’s owner, describing the business he’s lost since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s shelter-in-place order went into effect. “After this [COVID-19 pandemic], it’s not going to be the same. ... We are the ones who’s gonna take the risk; we are used to that. And we are the ones who have to be creative. ... People will be hesitant.”

Other venues have made the pivot to keep their cash flow going by opening up their spaces to community organizations who need areas to operate.

The Quarry, a South Shore-based venue that hosts live blues and jazz sets, has allowed Sweet Potato Patch, an organization that delivers healthy meals to Chicagoans who live in food deserts, to prepare meals at the venue while allowing community members to come in to receive equipment such as N95 face masks amid the pandemic.

Yvette Moyo, The Quarry’s CEO, says the venue wants to hand out meals for local blues artists who lost their ability to earn due to the pandemic.

“While we’re not doing entertainment and while we worry a lot about artists, we are making good use of our venue,” said Moyo. “They had a hustle lifestyle; it would be great if we could provide free meals to the artists that we were supporting in the past.”

Bruce Iglauer, president and founder of Alligator Records, which includes Lil’ Ed & The Blues Imperials, Christone “Kingfish” Ingram and Shemekia Copeland among the artists on its roster, has seen how the pandemic continues to crush gig workers like his artists.

“Until they either have a vaccine or they know that people become immune after having the illness, I don’t see how we’re going to be able to return to anything like the old normal,” said Iglauer. “So I’m concerned about the future for performing — not just the immediate future, but the long-term future.”",real

To support his melancholy views, Tice relays several reasons, including: depressed consumers, no viable cure for the coronavirus, and a job market in disarray.

Tice also harbors a bearish stock outlook. He was expecting the latest market rally because of what technical indicators were signaling, but doesn't think it has staying power.

Michael Batnick, the director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, bolsters Tice's case that the current rally is vulernable with historical evidence showing previous bear markets have followed a similar pattern.

If you're looking for a sanguine forecast of the US economic and market situation, it's best not to look to David Tice, chief investment officer at the $150 million Ranger Active Bear Fund (HDGE).

""I believe we will retest lows. I believe we will break through lows. I believe that we have a depression on our hands,"" he said on the ""Money Life with Chuck Jaffe"" podcast. ""This is not a standard, garden-variety recession.""

Tice's pessimistic view is perhaps unsurprising, given the fact that his fund makes money by selectively shorting stocks. But his outlook goes well beyond selective short-selling opportunities. He's worried about the economy and financial markets as a whole.

The CIO's stark economic prognostication rests upon a brigade of factors:

A depressed and frightened consumer

Disappearing jobs

A potential second coronavirus outbreak in the fall

Lack of a virus cure

Shrinking economic activity

Turmoil in small businesses

A stock market that is ""very, very expensive.""

All of these factors combine to make Tice believe that the worst for markets and the economy is yet to come. As for the ongoing rally off multiyear lows? Tice says he saw it coming, but he's not convinced it's built to last.

""This has been a retracement rally, and therefore we were expecting that,"" he said. ""Fibonacci tells us it should be between 38% and 63% on the retracement rally. We've had that. We've actually gone a little bit past that.""

For context, Fibonacci retracement levels are commonly used technical analysis indicators that attempt to pinpoint levels of support and resistance between price points. They're also used to forecast subsequent moves based on how an index responds to meeting these key thresholds.

The fundamental economic factors outlined above — combined with Tice's belief that the market's current rally is a mere head fake — informs his bearish outlook.

And Tice's lack of conviction in the ongoing rally is not without historical precedent. It's not uncommon for stocks to compulsively rally higher during longer bear markets. Michael Batnick, the director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, detailed this notion in a recent blog post.

Batnick noted that, over the last two bear markets, stocks experienced a number of false rallies — some over 20% — before running out of steam.

Provided below are two charts Batnick cites. The first details the S&P 500's behavior during the tech bubble of the early 2000s. In that two-year span, the S&P 500 rallied 12.1%, 7.7%, 8.6%, 19.0%, 20.7%, and another 20.7% — all on separate occasions — before eventually succumbing to the turmoil.

Here's the second chart detailing the S&P 500 during the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. Investors experienced five false rallies in the midst of a greater bear.

Michael Batnick/YCharts

""Even in the worst historical markets, stocks never went straight down,"" said Batnick. ""Often times there are several bear market rallies that give investor's a sigh of relief, only to see the carpet of hope ripped out right from underneath them.""

Tice agrees. And with all of that under consideration, he delivers a bleak final message.

""I believe that we are in a depression,"" Tice said. ""I believe that the longer-term consequences of this can't really be questioned.""

He concluded: ""Activity and feelings of consumers are going to change longer term by this outbreak of the China virus and that we have a lot more pain to go.""",real

Spain manager Luis Enrique, speaking to Spanish basketball show ""Colgados del Aro"", outlined his disdain for the lack of atmosphere without a fan presence in the stands.

""It's very ugly, I watched German football and it's lamentable. You can hear the insults and you lose the intimacy of the great moments, playing matches without a supporter is sadder than dancing with your sister,"" Enrique stated.

The coach did, however, concede that the return of sport in any capacity could help bolster the morale of sports fans throughout the world.

""This is a global business that generates a lot of money and even though the spectacle is very different to when you play with people, it can help us pass the time during confinement and get through this, and if you are a fan of football or basketball, then watching a match is always interesting,"" he said.

The comments sparked amusement on Twitter:

​Clubs in Europe have until the 25th of May to tell UEFA, Europe’s football governing body, whether they intend to resume the 2019-20 season.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium and now Scotland have already decided to end their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain and Italy plan to follow Germany’s example and resume play behind closed doors.

Many players in England’s Premier League; most notably Watford striker Troy Deeney, and Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose, have expressed concerns about the potential health and safety risks that completing the season may bring.

Deeney’s Watford teammate, centre-back Adrian Mariappa has also revealed his coronavirus diagnosis, no doubt compounding the fears of fellow professional athletes.

Speaking to British Newspaper the Telegraph, Mariappa explained that he was shocked by the news.

""It was a big surprise because I haven't really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids; I've mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit,” the defender stated.

Mariappa added that he was fortunate to have been able to access a coronavirus test, despite being asymptomatic.

“It's quite scary how you can feel absolutely fine and not really have left the house, and yet still get the virus. If it wasn't for the fact I had gone back to training and had this test, then I'd never have found out that I had the virus and I would just be getting on with things as normal. That's obviously quite a strange thought,” he added.

Premier League clubs are yet to agree on the terms under which the season could be resumed, and a vote on whether to host matches at neutral venues has been postponed, as rumours had arisen that a majority of sides in the division would vote against the proposals.

If the suggestion is eventually ruled out after the ballot takes place; then it would be doubtful whether Premier League games could actually return to the pitch, as only a few options for concluding the campaign would remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place, all of which could potentially lead to legal challenges from teams in bother the upper and lower echelons of the division.",fake
702,1203,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/coronavirus-how-sleepaway-camps-can-provide-protective-bubble.html,2020-05-16,"'Sleepaway camps have the potential to create a protective bubble,' says former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb","Getty Images

Twenty million children attend camps in the U.S. every summer, fueling the $18 billion camp industry. With summer just a little more than a month away, camp directors are still deciding if it's safe for camps to operate amid the coronavirus pandemic. And parents are equally concerned. On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said camps should not reopen unless they are able to implement coronavirus screening protocols, evaluating employees and children daily for symptoms and potential past exposures to Covid-19. But compliance with the CDC direction will depend on whether states adopt the decision tools into their own local policies — and whether the Trump administration supports and promotes the agency's guidelines. State and local guidance is expected to be provided as early as next week. According to Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, we are ""still in the early innings"" of the coronavirus crisis, but if it were up to him, he would choose to send his kids to a sleepaway camp over a day camp. At CNBC's Healthy Returns virtual conference on Tuesday, Gottlieb expressed that ""sleepaway camps have the potential to create a protective bubble that is easier to do than at day camps."" That's because at day camps the campers and staff are constantly coming and going, which could increase the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.

But Helene Drobenare, a social worker and the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camps in New York, said it's a misnomer that any camp can provide a bubble against Covid-19. ""A bubble is to assume that when you close the gate, that means you can't get mail, you can't get a milk delivery, you can't send anybody in or out to get any kind of food or supplies, and it means you won't have any day workers,"" she said. ""We probably could do a bubble for a very short time period, maybe a few days. I think a bubble is what we want to believe and it's what our hearts want and that's what we want for our children — a place that will be 100% safe and the disease won't find them there. But in my opinion, I don't think overnight camp can give that coverage. Nowhere in the world today could give that coverage. If it could, we wouldn't be where we are."" Camp Young Judaea has two day camps — one in Brooklyn and one in Croton-on-Hudson — as well as an overnight camp in the Hudson Valley. Collectively, about 750 campers attend the camps, which are considered to be in the coronavirus epicenter.

Jay Jacobs, executive director of Timber Lake Camps, told CNBC's John Fortt on ""Squawk Alley"" last week that he is hopeful his camps will run as planned this summer, claiming that there are ways to ensure a protected environment, especially in sleepaway, or residential, camps. TLC Camps is comprised of seven camps located in Long Island, the Catskill region of New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. His camps serve about 3,000 children. ""You can test your staff before they come to camp. You can test your campers before they come to camp and only accept those with negative tests, so you've already locked out Covid-19, at least initially,"" he said. ""Remember, many resident camps are in rural communities where the prevalence of the virus is not as great as down in the cities or suburbs.""

Quarantine's effect on kids' mental health

Some mental health experts believe that the harmful effect of kids in indefinite quarantine outweigh the risk of coronavirus exposure at camp. ""The need for connection is as fundamental a need as our need for food, oxygen and shelter, says humanistic psychologist Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman, author of ""Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization."" ""Of course, we must make sure that all children are protected from exposure to the coronavirus, but this protection shouldn't come at the expense of opportunities for shared play, connection and friendship. The right balance of our needs is necessary to become a fully functioning human being.""

But Denise Daniels, a pediatric oncology nurse and child development expert, says that while she has empathy for the kids hoping to attend summer camp, she has trepidation about them sleeping in bunk beds, sharing showers, making crafts and having meals together on those long wooden tables in the food pavilion. ""I understand what a critical time this is for the mental health and well-being of families after being on lockdown, adhering to social distancing and upholding the endless health rituals of washing hands, coughing and sneezing in elbows, wearing masks and staying six feet apart,"" she says. ""Lots of kids will be attending virtual summer camps this year, and unbelievably, there are tons of fun activities kids can do outside on Zoom or Skype."" Camp Young Judaea's Drobenare agrees. ""For the first time, they are creating relationships through a screen and not through touch or eye contact, but I believe that we have to deal the cards that are in front of us right now,"" she said. ""If you are asking me to choose between a disease that I'm not sure if it will cause death, or to help these kids somehow build relationships and find hope through a screen, then I think we have to do that and be as creative as we can until we can get through this. It's not the optimal situation, but I think life outweighs anything else in this type of risk.""

The American Camp Association, a community of camp professionals that has been in existence for over 100 years, is weighing the guidance from the CDC, along with rules and guidance from the state boards of health and other experts, to help individual camps make the decision as to whether they think they should operate camp this summer and if they could do so subject to the CDC's and state's rules. The ACA's mission is to ensure the quality of its 3,100 member camps across the U.S., which serves more than 10 million of the 20 million children who attend camps every summer across America. ""There's two words in social distance,"" ACA CEO Tom Rosenberg told CNBC's Scott Wapner on ""The Path Forward"" last week. ""First, as parents, we had to help our kids learn to distance themselves from their friends, and now as parents we are watching our kids starve themselves socially and emotionally from their own identity."" Rosenberg is a leading voice for young people today, advancing the public's understanding of the value of camp for everyone as an essential developmental and educational experience.

Heading off to Camp Virtual

While the ACA CEO said he is hopeful camps will be open this summer — not only for the survival of the camp industry but also so kids can begin to reconnect — he understands there is a very real possibility that camp may look very different in 2020. ""I expect to see all kinds of summer experiences. Like a continuum of camp. So this summer, camp will look different. It may even be virtual for some. But those connections are going to happen, and children will have joyful experiences that help them learn and grow with each other,"" said Rosenberg. ""Before the pandemic even began, Gen Z kids really had skyrocketing depression and anxiety. And then comes Covid 19. ... We are trying to create connections to help them reconnect with each other, to reconnect with adults and to themselves.""

As soon as shelter-in-place orders went into effect in the New York area, Drobenare says she closed Camp Young Judaea and in under two weeks pivoted to create Sprout@Home, a menu of activities including book clubs, yoga classes and online bunk meetups with a counselor. ""We may not be able to be together physically today, but we could be together emotionally and spiritually still,"" said Drobenare, who added that a final decision will be made by the end of the month as to whether or not they will run the camps this summer.

Coronavirus-related cases in youth

Headlines swirling the last several weeks about coronavirus-related cases rising among youth is also top of mind for parents and camp directors. To date at least 110 cases have been reported in New York, and three young people — ages 5, 7 and 18 — have died. Doctors believe the illness — which the CDC now calls multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C — has been reported in at least 19 states and Washington, D.C. It was previously referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

The condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome caused by a delayed immune system response to the coronavirus that can lead to blood vessel inflammation. The inflammatory disease is similar to Kawasaki disease, an illness most common in young children that causes high fever and swelling in blood vessels. Children may also develop a rash and experience abdominal pain and vomiting. Most of the kids who have developed the condition are between 5 and 9 years old and have either tested positive for coronavirus or were found to have antibodies, suggesting that they'd previously been infected.

A hopeful decline in late summer

Gottlieb is more optimistic about easing lockdown guidelines in late summer months. When the former FDA commissioner was asked by CNBC's Tyler Mathisen at the virtual conference if he would let his children swim at a public swimming pool or swim club this summer, he did not commit to an answer but said, ""Hopefully there's going to be a seasonal effect here and we are going to see cases decline in July or August and we can all take a little breather in the summer."" Nevertheless, he is still very concerned about the fall as the virus settles into a more ""seasonal pattern."" ""If you want to be optimistic, last week we had an average of around 27,000 new cases a day and 1,700 deaths. That's down from about 30,000 cases and 2,000 deaths. But it's still too early to tell."" To date the U.S. has nearly 1.46 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and at least 87,603 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Globally, the death toll has now surpassed 300,000.",real

Aside from that, ""everything is dramatically different,"" the WJBK-TV (Channel 2) news anchor says of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like every other industry, the TV news business has been upended since mid-March when coronavirus became the story in America. Anchors are separated — sometimes by a newsroom, sometimes by miles — reporters are broadcasting from home and photographers are practicing social distancing guidelines with their subjects.

Newsrooms, once bustling with bodies, have been reduced to skeleton crews, while interviews that would normally take place in-person are now beamed across Skype and Zoom.

Perkins, who is co-anchoring evening broadcasts with an at-home Monica Gayle, says in normal times, he's used to there being anywhere from 225-250 people in Fox 2's Southfield headquarters. Now there's sometimes only four, ""and I'm the fourth,"" he says. ""It's incredible.""

Yet the show goes on. ""We are adapting,"" says Perkins, who has been with Fox 2 for nearly 25 years. ""We’re using our experience to get things done.""

Their efforts are being rewarded in the ratings department.

Viewership is up across the board for local news. At WDIV-TV (Channel 4), numbers from 4-8 p.m. are up 22% from a year ago, and year-to-year, ratings are up 70%, according to the station's vice president and general manager, Marla Drutz.

The rewards come as the various stations have had to employ new ways of working and reporters, producers, editors and on-air personalities have had to learn new skill sets on the fly.

Kevin Jeanes, the morning weatherman at WXYZ-TV (Channel 7), has been working from his Royal Oak home since late March.

In the newsroom, he's used to working off six computers; in his set-up at home, he has two laptops and two iPhones. The monitor he uses to communicate with the station is an old TV that he places in front of him during his morning remotes, which start every weekday at 4:30 a.m. and last through 9 a.m., at a rate of eight or nine per hour.

He's lit by a ring light he bought for $45 off Amazon and he broadcasts via an app on one of his phones from a back corner of his basement, which he outfitted with a few bookcases to look more like a home office and less like, well, the back corner of his basement. While he's doing local weather updates during cutaways from ""Good Morning America,"" his wife and 18-month-old son are upstairs sleeping.

Well, sometimes they're sleeping. ""My son can be kind of loud, and sometimes he'll be banging around upstairs and I know you can hear him on-air,"" Jeanes says. ""Yesterday morning, I changed his diaper during a commercial break.""

WXYZ-TV morning weatherman Kevin Jeanes works from home in Royal Oak. (Photo: Kevin Jeanes)

Jeanes, who's been giving himself haircuts since the lockdown began, also does call-ins with WKQI-FM's (Channel 955) ""Mojo in the Morning"" program; he does those from inside a storage closet, tucked between a mattress and some clothes.

He's making the most of the situation and enjoys being so close to his wife and child during a time of such great worldwide unease. What he misses most about going into the office is the camaraderie of his co-workers.

""It’s a little bit harder to have fun at work,"" Jeanes says. ""You're used to being around the buzz of the newsroom and a lot of people, and now I’m just in this quiet basement all by myself. And when you don't have people around you, it's hard to bring that high energy every morning, which is what people expect.""

Alex Atwell, a photographer for WDIV, is having to learn how to convey energy in his stories in a new way.

Under social distancing guidelines, he's filming interviews from at least six feet away using a long microphone, rather than having subjects fit with a small lavalier microphone, which clips on their shirts and allows for free movement — and with that, more visual possibilities for the Emmy-winning cameraman.

""For me, the lavalier is key to creative storytelling and active interviews, and that has been taken away,"" says Atwell, who has been with Channel 4 since 2008. ""We all have to think differently try to keep the quality up and be creative in different ways.""

Atwell is used to teaming up with a reporter, talking through a story on the way to an assignment and collaborating on its look and various story elements.

Since the pandemic began, Atwell now rides alone in his news truck and meets up with a reporter, who drives separately, at an assignment; afterward, they use transcription apps to pass files back and forth to each other, rather than working on something together hand-in-hand.

""For the most part, I’m the only one in my truck,"" Atwell says. At the beginning of his shift he spends up to 15 minutes wiping down everything in the truck: the heat shifters, lights, radio, steering wheel, seats, work stations, ""all kinds of other buttons,"" he says. ""You don't realize how many things you touch in a vehicle.""

And Atwell says he's the only person who handles his equipment. Even if it means more trips to and from his van, he'll haul his own tripod, mic stand and camera, and he stays six feet from everyone with whom he interacts.

His main goal, he says, is to limit exposure risk to COVID-19.

""It's an abundance of caution,"" says Atwell, who wears a mask at all times while working in the field. ""When I go out, I assume I have it and I assume the person I’m with has it. I take that mindset.""

From a practical standpoint, one of the biggest obstacles he currently faces is the lack of bathrooms at his disposal. He's used to driving around the city all day hopping between assignments, but now that most businesses are closed, he can't run into a McDonald's or a Starbucks and use the restroom facilities the way he's used to doing.

""You've either gotta hold it all day, or sometimes I can rush home,"" Atwell says.

Buy Photo News videographer Alex Atwell, left, and reporter Larry Spruill are having to cover stories in a new way. (Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News)

Atwell — whose long-running ""Uniquely Detroit"" series, which highlight local citizens, artists and businesses doing positive things in the community, is currently on hold due to the pandemic — is also an example of the way Detroit's TV stations are working together during these unprecedented times. He was the cameraman during the town hall with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on April 2 that was simulcast on Channels 2, 4 and 7.

Fox 2's Perkins anchored that broadcast along with Channel 4's Devin Scillian and Channel 7's Carolyn Clifford. Perkins says the collaboration between the three affiliates was a ""wonderful"" show of solidarity across network and competition lines. ""It was great for the community to see us all working together,"" he says.

Early on during the state's lockdown, Perkins elected to continue to come into the Fox 2 studio and be the familiarity that viewers could find at a time when so much of their lives had been overturned. ""I thought it was important that somebody be there,"" he says.

It hasn't been business as usual. He was initially coming home and sanitizing every piece of clothing he was wearing after his shifts, a process that is no longer as rigorous, he says.

Clockwise from top left: Monica Gayle, Sherry Margolis, Amy Lange, Roop Raj, Huel Perkins and Taryn Asher work from home and the newsroom. (Photo: Fox 2)

On-air, Perkins' Thursday night ""Let It Rip"" segments — which typically feature a panel of guests debating the topics of the day, the more spirited the better — are now conducted remotely, and the slight pauses and delays in connections make it harder to really let it rip. ""It's a conversation,"" Perkins says, ""and in-person is always better.""

Likewise, he's used to sitting next to his co-anchor, but now he'll text Gayle during breaks and downtime during the broadcast.

But he's still there, and that's what's important. The veteran anchor says he's heard from viewers who have told him he's helped make them feel less afraid, which was his intention.

""I want to be that calm, reassuring voice to let the viewers know that yes it's tough, yes it’s difficult, but we’re going to get through this,"" he says. ""It’s going to take some time. Not weeks, not months, maybe a year, but we're starting to realize we’re not going to return to exactly what we were.

""This is going to change our world. In a sense, we will never go back to what we were. But we will find a way through it.""

707,421,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/24/21233524/face-masks-coronavirus-consumer-guide,2020-04-24,Coronavirus mask guide: What you need to know about the masks we all need to wear,"Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, Americans have gone from viewing face masks as a quirky feature of big-city life in Asia to feeling almost naked without one when we step inside a grocery store.

Numerous Chicago suburbs have mandated that face masks be worn in certain public settings. And beginning May 1, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has ordered all people in Illinois “to wear a face-covering or a mask when in a public place where they can’t maintain a six-foot social distance.” That will last at least until May 31.

The federal government now advises Americans to wear cloth masks in public, especially in areas with significant community-based transmission.

Scientists say the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will likely stick around indefinitely.

So with people possibly donning masks all summer and possibly into 2021, here’s what you need to know:

The different types of face masks

N95 masks: These disposable masks are fitted tightly to the face, with a metal bridge over the nose and bands that stretch around the head. They block 95% of particles of 0.3 microns or larger — but they’re not for most of us. These are the masks you see medical professionals wearing, often under their clear plastic face shields.

They block 95% of particles of 0.3 microns or larger — but they’re not for most of us. These are the masks you see medical professionals wearing, often under their clear plastic face shields. Medical or surgical masks: Also used by medical personnel but now being used by the general public, too, these disposable masks filter about 60% to 80% of particles. They consist of a rectangular, paper-like covering held across the face with stretchy loops over the ears.

Also used by medical personnel but now being used by the general public, too, these disposable masks filter about 60% to 80% of particles. They consist of a rectangular, paper-like covering held across the face with stretchy loops over the ears. Cloth masks: These can range from snug, double-layered, tightly-woven cloth masks with elastic ear loops (the best) to a bandana draped across your face (not as good).

Why wear a mask?

A mask helps keep droplets from your mouth or nose from getting on others. And a mask — even a good cloth mask — might help prevent virus particles from reaching your airway.

It’s thought that 25% or more of people with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, which means you or anyone you encounter could be silently shedding virus particles, says Margaret Gardel, a physics professor at the University of Chicago who is studying face masks as part of N95Decon.org, a multi-university consortium.

“This is the real reason we want the general public to be wearing masks,” she says.

But a mask is not magical. You still need to keep up social distancing, avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently to protect yourself from the coronavirus.

Where can I get one?

N95 masks are being produced solely for medical providers and first-responders. So, unless you already have one at home, you won’t be able to get one.

If you do have an N95, you could use it for errands, with two caveats:

Use it only once a week to help ensure that any virus particles die off.

Understand that it’s a disposable mask that, after about five uses, will no longer seal as designed.

As for medical masks, it will be several months before we see wider availability, says Nezih Altay, a DePaul University professor and expert on supply chains. “Demand is way too high right now. And supply is not even close.”

Cloth masks are available online for around $7 and up from retailers or do-it-yourselfers.

This summer, expect to see face mask fashion take off. Community groups have been offering free cloth masks to people who need them.

You can make your own cloth mask, either a sew or no-sew version, using instructions from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

How should it fit?

A medical or cloth mask covers the face from the bridge of the nose, over the mouth and under the chin. It’s held in place by loops around the ears. Never drop one side to talk, as that defeats the purpose of the mask.

Unlike an N95 mask, which fits tightly around the nose and mouth, a medical or cloth mask will have gaps near the ears. Still, either type offers better protection than a bandana, which tends to gap right under the mouth, says Jill Crittenden, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who’s on the N95 consortium.

How should I clean a cloth mask?

Cloth masks should be washed daily in soapy water and run through a dryer on low heat or hung to dry.

Disposable medical masks should sit for a week before being used again. Crittenden says she has seven medical masks labeled “Monday,” “Tuesday,” “Wednesday” and so forth, which she rotates from week to week.",real

What to know about antibody testing

Texas has seen a steady rise in novel coronavirus cases and fatalities since reopening just over two weeks ago.

There are now 45,198 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That is an increase of 1,347 cases from Thursday to Friday. The new numbers have not yet been recorded for Saturday.

Last Friday, the daily case increase was 1,219.

While the cases are still well below New York, the state with the most confirmed cases at more than 345,000, the steady increase shows that the curve has not yet flattened in Texas.

The state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272.

Last Friday, the daily death toll was 31.

Hospitalizations rates have appeared to flatten, but that data is reported on a two-week lag. Currently there are 1,716 people in a Texas hospital, according to the health department.

Gov. Greg Abbott's communications director John Wittman told ABC News that the amount of testing has doubled since reopening, contributing to the rise in cases.

""Since [COVID-19 testing] started, we did 330,000 tests in March and April. Since May 1, we have done over 330,000 -- so in 16 days we have doubled our testing from the previous entire two months,"" Wittman said.

""The governor has been clear that as the state of Texas conducts more tests, we will see the raw number of cases rise,"" Wittman said. ""However, the [rolling seven-day] average positivity rate has steadily declined from our high April 13 [of a bit more than 13%] to around 5% today. Our hospitalizations remain steady, and Texas has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the nation.""

Texas began reopening after its stay-at-home order was lifted on April 30.

Restaurants are open for in-person dining at 25% capacity. Movie theaters and malls are also open at 25% capacity.

Retail stores, libraries and museums are fully open. Come Monday, gyms will reopen too.

The two most populous counties -- Harris and Dallas -- have recorded the most cases. There are 8,817 confirmed cases in Harris County and 6,837 confirmed cases in Dallas County.

The state has tested nearly 646,000 people out of a population of 29 million. Cases are most likely higher because of how few people have been tested.

President Donald Trump thinks maybe. There's no data to support that.,"President Trump said Monday is he taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug the FDA says is neither safe nor effective in treating COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine is FDA-approved to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used to treat some forms of drug-resistant malaria or to protect against certain types of malaria.

The President appears to be taking it as a prophylactic, with the thought it could prevent someone exposed to coronavirus from getting it. There is at least one study looking into this usage underway but no data to support the idea yet.

Hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name Plaquenil.

Because it is FDA-approved for those diseases, physicians are legally free to prescribe it in any manner they want ""off-label,"" meaning not for the reason listed on the drug's label.

It is not available over the counter at drug stores. It is also different from chloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that Trump has at times suggested as a treatment or preventative for COVID-19.

There is no data to support the notion that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine helps people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

There is strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

“There’s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe. There’s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe,” said Dr. Daniel Kaul, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Michigan school of medicine. “

The FDA has cautioned that hydroxychloroquine should be limited to people in clinical trials, which are carefully overseen, or who are hospitalized, due to concerns about the potentially dangerous adverse effects.

Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, the drug he touted as coronavirus treatment, despite FDA warnings

A study posted on April 21 involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Veterans Health Administration medical centers found there were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those receiving standard care. In addition, the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week. It is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus.

In a statement on the N.I.H. website about the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people, ""we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.”

'This will kill you': People are warning others following Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

The University of Minnesota is also in the midst of a large study of whether the drug can be used prophylactically, but it will not be completed until August.

""There is no data that pre-exposure prophylaxis is effective in prevention COVID-19. The study we're conducting should help us answer the question,"" said Mahmoud Al-Kofahi, a professor of experimental and clinical pharmacology at the University of Minnesota.

Another worry is that people taking it might have a false sense that they’re protected from becoming infected COVID-19 or cannot become infected and therefore cannot pass it along.

“The concern would be they might change their behavior and put others at risk,” said Michigan's Kaul.

Hydroxychloroquine craze has French roots

The drug first came to public attention after several small, anecdotal, non-peer reviewed reports about the drugs in China in February. None were up to the scientific gold standard of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that would definitively show they worked or not.

Interest in hydroxychloroquine took off when a controversial microbiologist in France posted a video on Feb. 25 promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. Didier Raoult, has denied climate change is happening and wrote a book declaring Darwin's theory of evolution was wrong.

Raoult then posted two small studies of the drugs on COVID-19 patients that were quickly criticized by scientists because they had no control group, making it impossible to know if people who got the drugs recovered any faster than those who didn't.

Television doctor Mehmet Oz initially supported the drug multiple times on Fox and Friends but later backed away from it.

Trump first spoke about hydroxychloroquine given together with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 19. He went on to tout them numerous times in various media and public events.

On April 13 he announced his administration had deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from the National Stockpile. ""Just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that, that drug,"" he said in a briefing.

Since late April Trump had toned down his support of the drug, but during a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at the White House on Monday said he began about a week and a half ago.

That was around the time two people in the White House who would have been in close contact with him tested positive for COVID-19. One was a valet to the president, the other Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller.",real

Such a vaccine would inoculate people against the coronavirus, making a return to ordinary life possible. But given the clinical trials and logistical challenges of inoculating more than 300 million people, not to mention the rest of the world, most experts do not believe a mass vaccination program will take place for another 18 months.

There are numerous vaccines in various stages of development and testing, but approval for any of them will likely take several months at least.

But the drug industry executive Trump tapped as a co-director of the effort, while acknowledging that deploying a vaccine by the end of the year was an aggressive schedule, called it a “credible objective.”

Standing behind Trump was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Testifying before the Senate earlier in the week, Fauci said that even once a vaccine has been developed, there was “no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective” when deployed in the general population.

Trump said the project would be “big” and “fast,” and likened it to the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. He suggested that a vaccine could begin to be available to the public by the end of this year.

Fauci has previously said that it was “doable” to have a vaccine by January. But others are skeptical of Trump’s timeline. “I don’t see a path by which any vaccine is licensed — whether it’s emergency use or otherwise — until the third quarter of 2021,” Dr. Peter Hotez, a Baylor College of Medicine epidemiologist who is working on a vaccine of his own, told CNN shortly after Trump made his remarks. “I just don’t see how you collect enough safety and efficacy data to say that we can have a vaccine for general use by the end of the year.”

Trump provided few details about the new initiative, though he did announce that it would be headed by Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical executive, and Gustave Perna, commanding general of United States Army Materiel Command. (Slaoui will oversee the medical research, and Perna will supervise the logistics of manufacturing and distribution.) Details of the project had emerged in recent days, suggesting the kind of public-private partnership that Trump has endorsed in other aspects of the coronavirus response. Some two dozen private U.S. companies are now working on a coronavirus vaccine, as is the U.S. military.

Trump was at pains to say that regardless of when a vaccine was developed, the nation was already returning to normal. “I want to make one thing clear: Vaccine or no vaccine, we’re back,” the president said. He has previously described himself as the nation’s premier cheerleader, arguing that optimism was necessary at a time of crisis.",real

Some events may not survive the pandemic,"We asked experts in various fields for their best predictions on what the world will look like when the coronavirus pandemic finally recedes. In this segment of our series, ""The Next Normal,"" we examine what happens to the highly popular running industry as thousands of races have been cancelled, and what races of the future might look like. *** Tens of thousands of runners herded into corrals, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Nervous energy and excitement filling the air. And then the ""pop"" of the gun, signaling that the race has begun, and wave after wave of runners breaking across the starting line. This is the scene at the start of the world's largest marathons, which in some cases have upwards of 40,000 participants. These races are big-ticket events that attract runners from around the globe along with their families and fans, while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for their host cities. But in the face of the coronavirus, the fate of road racing — like so many other sports — remains uncertain. As running has grown in popularity, local clubs have popped up around the country, and there are now roughly 35,000 races each year in the U.S. alone, data from industry trade group Running USA shows. More than 44 million people in the U.S. identify as a runner, and 17.6 million people crossed the finish line in U.S. races in 2019. With all races cancelled for the time being, billions of dollars are at stake. The biggest marathons – from Boston to Chicago to London to Tokyo – inject hundreds of millions of dollars into local economies. The most recent analysis of the TCS New York City Marathon, for example, found that the race's economic impact topped $400 million.

These marathons are the largest in the world and attract international runners, but most race organizers in the U.S. are small businesses that depend on registration fees for as much as 95% of their revenue. And with no clear timeframe for when road racing will again be permitted, thousands of jobs are on the line. The effects will be compounded throughout the race ecosystem — timers, t-shirt makers, medal engravers, and, of course, the hotels and restaurants that the athletes and their fans patronize. With runners sidelined, organizations like Ironman and New York Road Runners are offering virtual races as the industry grapples with what events could look like as the pandemic rages on. Some are hopeful that precautionary measures, such as fewer participants and staggered start times, might make races — especially shorter 5Ks — possible, while others say large-scale races are unlikely until there's a vaccine. ""I don't know the overall impact … but it's pretty devastating to our sport for sure,"" said Bart Yasso, former chief running officer for Runner's World, and one of the few people to have run a marathon on all seven continents. ""A lot of these event companies are going to really be hurt by this, and some of these smaller races just aren't going to survive.""

Races of the future

Looking towards the future, it's not only the sheer size of these races, of course, that poses a health risk, but the physical activity itself. Among other things, heavy and fast breathing out of one's mouth means that virus-transmitting droplets can travel further than just six feet according to Dr. Cordelia Carter, an orthopedic surgeon and director of the Center for Women's Sports Health at NYU Langone. A lot depends, of course, on the trajectory of the virus over the next few months. While cities have the final say over whether or not events can take place, racing companies are already mapping out what the future might look like. Ironman Group CEO Andrew Messick said the company is focusing on five broad elements: Density reduction, such as fewer race participants

Minimizing touch points with athletes throughout the race

Education and training to make sure people understand best practices

Promoting self-reliance, such as having athletes carry their own nutrition

Increasing pre-race screening ""What we're going to continue to do, is to work very closely with our communities … when they're ready for us to come back, our goal is to be able to deliver an event that's going to fit within whatever parameters they decide is appropriate for their community,"" Messick said. Ironman Group is the largest organizer of mass sporting events in the world, with more than 235 races — including the popular Rock 'n' Roll series — across 55 countries.

Dr. Brett Toresdahl, a primary sports medicine physician at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said that other precautions could include taking participants' temperatures when they enter corrals — where runners are grouped at the starting line — and limiting the size of the corrals from hundreds or thousands of people to just dozens. Toresdahl, who is a team physician for US Biathlon and Rugby United New York, added that the nature of the virus itself makes it especially challenging due to the number of asymptomatic cases. On Thursday, New York Road Runners said that it had cancelled all races through August 15, but that the TCS New York City Marathon – the largest in the world – is still scheduled for November 1. NYRR president and CEO Michael Capiraso said that the organization is modelling ways to minimize contact throughout the race — such as at water stations — and that a lot will be learned in the coming months as smaller races take place. ""Between now and the marathon there's a lot of time to explore with smaller races and smaller events and see what else is happening out there,"" he said. ""Lots of people are sharing things across the industry because everyone is very eager to get back.""

Economic impact

Road racing has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry, and the world's largest marathons have a significant economic impact on cities across the globe.

The 2018 Bank of America Chicago Marathon brought in $378 million for the city, while the most recent analysis of the NYC marathon in 2014 showed that it generated $415 million for New York. The 2019 Boston Marathon injected in excess of $200 million into the local economy, and the most recent study of the Virgin Money London Marathon in 2015 showed an economic benefit of £128 million, or about $155.8 million. These highly popular events will continue to attract participants for years to come, but smaller races might not fare as well. Running USA CEO Rich Harshbarger noted that the majority of race organizers in the country are small businesses that employ an average of eight people, with between 40% and 95% of annual revenue coming in from race fees. In addition to full-time employees, companies typically partner with contractors for each event. ""Everybody that's in the race business relies on dozens, if not hundreds, of small companies that are largely owner-operated,"" Ironman's Messick said. As race cancellations build, Harshbarger said the industry is ""suffering tremendously"" and that, since it has no league or players association, it's sometimes overlooked. For this reason over 500 endurance event operators across the country — including Ironman and Running USA — banded together in April to launch the Endurance Sports Coalition, which is seeking longer-term funding for event operators. Virtually every business is feeling the impacts of the virus, but unlike restaurants, for instance, that can pivot to take-out and delivery options, race providers only have one revenue stream.

""Without specifically targeted help from the federal government, endurance sports may not survive the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the organization's website says. ""Many events with long and proud histories do not have the resources to weather this storm and will not be able to ramp up again next year.""

What happens next?

With races cancelled, organizations are seeking to stay connected with athletes by taking the course virtual. Athletes run the race distance on their own during a set time period, and then simply upload their results. New York Road Runner's virtual Brooklyn half marathon in May had more than 10,000 participants. Nearly 40,000 people have registered to compete in the first three Rock 'n' Roll virtual races, while 125,000 athletes have signed up for the first six Ironman virtual races.

Microsoft is working with the Seattle-based biotech Adaptive Biotechnologies to better understand the different ways that individuals' immune systems respond to the virus.

The duo are now recruiting 1,000 people for a study that will analyze T cells, a critical component in how human bodies fight invading threats.

The early research could help build T-cell tests, which could supplement antibody testing. It could also better instruct vaccines and therapeutics that are now in development.

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" said Lance Baldo, chief medical officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus has confounded doctors by causing a range of symptoms in patients.

COVID-19 is first and foremost a lung disease, but its effects can include blood clots, heart problems, and even 'COVID toes' that turn purple and swollen. Some patients have mild symptoms, and others get severely ill.

Plus, some of the most critically ill patients appear to suffer more from their own immune response than from the virus itself. The immune system goes into hyperdrive, overreacting to the virus and causing serious damage to the person's own body.

Researchers are now trying to unravel the mysteries about the immune system's response to the coronavirus. A better understanding of how humans react to the virus could instruct future diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

The technology giant Microsoft has jumped into this work, focusing on a part of the immune response not frequently talked about — at least not yet — with COVID-19: T cells.

Microsoft is working with Adaptive Biotechnologies, a Seattle biotech specializing in decoding immune responses. Adaptive has a market value of about $4.7 billion.

The duo are hoping that better understanding the T-cell response in humans could be help understand and fight the virus. Microsoft will help crunch the massive amount of collected data using its machine learning capabilities and Azure cloud platform.

The two started working together in 2018 to develop a T-cell blood test that could detect multiple diseases, such as Lyme disease. While that work is ongoing, the companies expanded the agreement in March to include COVID-19.

Antibodies have been a research focus for COVID-19 testing, therapeutics, and vaccines

Antibodies have been the star of the show, hogging much of the early attention. These virus-fighting proteins have been known by scientists for more than a century. Going back to the 1918 influenza pandemic, they are the key ingredient in the treatment called convalescent plasma, which helps the sick recover.

Over the last three decades, scientists have developed methods to screen antibodies for potency, then clone and produce the best candidates at massive scale. These antibody treatments are now being developed for COVID-19, with human testing expected to start this summer.

Antibodies have also become a focus of the diagnostic world. Called serological tests, a blood sample can reveal if someone has coronavirus-fighting antibodies. If they do, it likely suggests a level of protection against re-infection. The best serological tests now have extremely high accuracy rates.

Antibodies will also likely play a role in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. Researchers are now trying to figure out the level of antibodies needed in the body to protect against infection. That could be used as an indirect measure to see if experimental vaccines are producing enough antibodies to protect people.

T cells could also play a key role in COVID-19

But antibodies are just one part of the immune response. Another key element in fighting viral infections is T cells.

T cells are the body's first response to a foreign invader in the body. Some T cells will kill infected cells and fight the virus, and others help pump out antibodies and coordinate the body's attack.

While much of COVID-19 research is digging into the antibody response, the T-cell response remains more of a mystery.

To better understand the role of T cells, Microsoft and Adaptive have launched a 1,000-person study across the US. The research is early, and plans to explore how T-cell responses vary from person to person.

They are recruiting people who have likely been exposed to the virus, are infected, and have recently recovered. Volunteers will have their blood drawn and nose or throat swabbed by a phlebotomist who will visit their home.

Lance Baldo, the chief medical officer of Adaptive, said he hopes the findings could help build better diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines for COVID-19.

'Developing a third pillar of diagnostics'

""What we're developing is a third pillar of diagnostics, which is looking specifically at the T cells,"" Baldo said in an interview.

A T-cell test could complement serological testing, particularly if it can help identify some of the gaps in antibody-based tests. It's unclear if every recovered COVID-19 patient generates long-lasting, protective antibodies. If some do not develop a meaningful antibody response, a T-cell test could help figure out who is truly protected, Baldo said.

T cells have mainly been the focus of cancer treatments, perhaps best known for the CAR-T therapies that first came to market in 2017. These ground-breaking treatments fight certain types of cancer using patients' own T cells, genetically engineering them to be more potent.

It's too early to know if there could be a similar treatment for COVID-19. CAR-T therapies are complicated and expensive, with serious potential side effects.

But the T-cell trial could help answer many questions about the coronavirus. Baldo said his researchers are planning to use the data to map the natural decay of T cells. This could help quantify when someone was first infected with COVID-19.

Another potential use would be flagging people that are likely to suffer from an overactive immune response to infection. The research could help explain why some infected people have mild symptoms while others wind up on ventilators. ICU patients have significantly lower levels of T-cells than other patients, some early findings suggest.

A T-cell test could add an extra stamp on the immunity passport

Policymakers across the world are mulling the idea of 'immunity passports.' The idea being that people who have recovered from the virus are likely immune to re-infection, and could safely re-enter the workforce and society.

There are ethical and scientific concerns around the idea. We do not know how long-lasting any type of immunity is. And it could incentivize people to intentionally try to get infected, if the alternative is sheltering inside while others are free to roam.

""Immunity is going to be hard, because for immunity you really need re-exposure if you're going to say that you are immune,"" Baldo said. ""We can impute that someone is immune, but to actually say someone is immune is going to be hard for a while.""

Baldo has reservations about the immunity passport concept, but added if countries do take that approach it likely won't be just one test. Instead, it may require several serology tests along with a T-cell test, for instance, like collecting multiple stamps on a passport.

Adaptive's Baldo said they are hoping to draw some initial insights from this T-cell study in June. The companies have pledged to make the data freely available to researchers. So far, about 100 people have joined and the study is recruiting in roughly two dozen metro areas across the US. More information on signing up is available at immunerace.com.",real

One method the Trump administration appears to have employed is the encouragement of allies to abandon work with Chinese tech firms.

The US ambassador to Australia reaffirmed on Sunday that he has full confidence in the country’s ability to protect its telecommunications networks from potential Chinese espionage after the Trump administration threatened to react strongly to allies who join China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

The diplomatic gesture of solidarity by ambassador Arthur B. Culvahouse follows critical statements by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over a $1 billion infrastructure deal signed between the Australian state of Victoria and China that could include work on 5G telecommunications systems by Beijing’s companies.

In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, May 24, Pompeo said that, “I don’t know the nature of these projects precisely,” but added that, “to the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens, or security networks for our defence and intelligence communities - we simply disconnect, we will simply separate.”

“We are going to preserve trust in networks for important information. We hope our friends and allies, especially our Five Eyes partners like Australia, do the same,” he added.

​The Five Eyes is the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

In what appeared to be a barely veiled threat, Pompeo also spoke of “some cost” to those nations who join the BRI and said that “every citizen of Australia should know that every one of those Belt and Road projects needs to be looked at incredibly closely.”

However, on Sunday afternoon, ambassador Culvahouse released a statement that apparently aimed at forestalling any possible rupture in relations with Australia following Pompeo’s comments.

“The United States has absolute confidence in the Australian Government's ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners,” Mr Culvahouse said.

“We have made no secret of our concerns about 5G, and we commend Australia for its leadership on the issue. We are not aware that Victoria has engaged in any concrete projects under BRI, let alone projects impinging on telecommunications networks, which we understand are a federal matter. If there were telecommunications initiatives that we thought put the integrity of our networks at risk, of course we would have to take a close look at that, as the Secretary [Pompeo] suggested,” Mr Culvahouse elaborated.

The Trump administration has turned an increasingly critical gaze toward China since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Following a series of strongly worded threats, President Trump last week said that the US will “react strongly” if China imposes a new security law in Hong Kong aimed at curbing anti-Beijing protests.

Australia, along with the US, UK and other allies, has called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus and whether China can ultimately be blamed for it. In response to bipartisan persistence within the Australian parliament for such an investigation, China’s ambassador to the country, Cheng Jingye, threatened that his country would boycott Australian products.

In response to Mr Jingye’s comments, officials from across the US congress signed a letter in which they proclaimed the US, “will always have Australia’s back.”",fake

In Quebec, the new coronavirus (Sars-Cov-2) was referred to as a virus that was certainly contagious, but which did not threaten the health of Quebecers more than necessary. Various experts reported in the newspapers indicated that seasonal influenza caused more deaths than this new virus, that Sars Cov-2 was less to fear than the influenza with which we have to deal cyclically and which leads annually to approximately 3500 deaths in Canada, 295 000 to 600 000 worldwide.

In early March, the narrative changed in a frightening way. Following the World Health Organization’s (WHO) announcement of a pandemic status, most Western countries responded by restricting air traffic and closing borders. This was followed by declarations of health emergencies that led to the seizure of power by the Public Health Directorates (PHDs). This last aspect is of prime importance, as the seizure of power brought most economic sectors and social life to a standstill.

During this period, it is important to realize that the reins of the state were given to the DSPs (Dr. Horacio Arruda in Quebec). In other words, the emergency health law, like martial law, deprived citizens of their rights and freedoms in order to protect them from a major crisis situation. It goes without saying that the implementation of these laws, which are opposed to democracy and civil law, should only be done in extreme emergency situations.

We were therefore told, on the basis of figures given by the WHO (3.4% mortality rate), that the situation was one of extreme urgency. The statistical curves based on these data predicted, for example, the deaths of approximately 60,000 Quebeckers and 2 million Americans if we did not proceed with containment measures. These figures are chilling and would have justified the health emergency measures taken by governments. The problem is that these predictions proved to be exaggerated. Indeed, several experts have questioned the credibility of WHO data on mortality rates based on two major issues:

– how many cases of coronavirus are there actually?

– and how many people die directly from it?

First, the number of cases with the virus is underestimated. Data from China (1), Germany (2) and the United States (3) suggest that the number of cases infected with Covid-19 was, from the beginning of the pandemic, much higher than that reported by public health authorities. Based on these data, therefore, it is likely that the number of people infected with Sars-Cov-2 was already high in the “healthy population” when the first mortality rates and alarmist predictions were revealed to the population.

Since the various national CSPs, with WHO as a chaperone, calculated mortality rates based on the number of confirmed cases or on a lower number of cases than the actual number of cases (i.e. excluding many asymptomatic cases or people who develop mild forms of Covid-19 without ever being tested), it is clear that the mortality rate was inflated as a result. This is what Dr. Antony Fauci and colleagues said in an editorial note in the New England Journal of Medicine published on February 28, 2020:

Assuming that the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases is several times higher than the number of reported cases, the case-fatality rate can be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of COVID-19 may ultimately be closer to those of severe seasonal influenza (which has a case-fatality rate of about 0.1%) or pandemic influenza (similar to 1957 and 1968).

According to Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and researcher at Stanford University in California, the mortality rate of Covid-19 was from the outset greatly overestimated by the lack of effective screening. In an editorial video by journalist Fareed Zakaria posted on CNN’s website, he reports that Dr. Ioannidis believes that based on an effective screening method such as the one used on the Diamond Princess in the Italian town of Vo’ Euganeo, Iceland or Denmark, the estimated mortality rate of Covid-19 would be about the same as that of seasonal influenza.

For Dr. Ioannidis, any statistical model based on exponential case growth is highly vulnerable to estimation errors. If the denominator on which to count mortality rates is incorrectly established, the statistical model may come up with a rate that is erroneous by a multiplier of 10, 30, or even 50. In other words, the number of deaths would be 10 to 50 times lower than the statistical models predict. According to Dr. Ioannidis’ estimates, the case-fatality rate of Covid-19 would be 0.05% to 1%, much lower than the 3.4% initially proposed by WHO (4). According to the same estimates, the actual number of deaths related to Covid-19 in the United States could be in the range of 10,000 to 40,000. These figures are exactly within the range of influenza-related deaths in the United States in 2019 (5).

(5) In Quebec, for example, we were told that there could have been as many as 60,000 deaths if there had been no containment. If we take a median multiplier compared to Dr. Ioannidis’ proposals, that is, a negative multiplier of 30, we would have a mortality rate of 2,000 people. That’s about the same number of deaths that occur during seasonal influenza episodes. For example, the number of deaths associated with influenza and pneumonia in Quebec in 2016, when there was no high peak mortality, was 1733 (6).

(6) As of May 5, 2020, the date of publication of this article, the official number of deaths was close to 2,400 in Quebec, around 70,000 in the United States and around 250,000 worldwide. However, the method of calculating the number of deaths raises major questions. In an open letter written to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi mentions (7):

The mistake is made worldwide to report virus-related deaths as soon as it is established that the virus was present at the time of death – irrespective of other factors. This violates a basic principle of infectiology: a diagnosis can only be made when it is certain that an agent played a significant role in the illness or death.

As Dr. Bhakdi points out, it is thus impossible to distinguish between deaths genuinely related to Covid-19 and deaths that occurred for other medical reasons in the accidental presence of the virus. In other words, no distinction is made between those who died because of the virus and those who died with the virus. We will see that this practice, probably under the orders of the WHO, has been widespread throughout the world.

In Quebec, we have heard Dr. Arruda mention the issue of epidemiological links several times. That is exactly the mistake Dr. Bhakdi is talking about. According to this way of calculating, even in cases of “Covid-19 deaths”, people are included who have symptoms similar to those of the disease, without testing to make sure. On April 16, 2020, Dr. Arruda stated in the daily press briefing of the Quebec government:

“There has been a change in the method of data entry and epidemiological analysis by public health of patients who have died within the last week. The choice we made was to report all patients, even patients who were not tested, but who have all the definitions to be patients who died from Covid-19. »

Another aberration in the way deaths are counted is that public health chooses to consider as “Covid-19 deaths” people who simply rubbed shoulders with other Covid-19 sufferers or deaths. In other words, if a woman in a long-term care facility died and occupied a room adjacent to a confirmed case of Covid-19, she was declared to have died of Covid-19. This is what Dr. Arruda said at the press briefing on April 14, 2020, following a question about non-routine screening:

“We’re not waiting for the coroner’s inquest, we’re counting these cases. We haven’t tested every case. It’s a case definition called epidemiologically linked cases. If there are cases in a long-term care facility, on the same floor, 1 or 2 cases confirmed in the laboratory, if in the next room you have a case, no other reasons for death as such, we are almost certain, to a large extent, that it is Covid-19”.

In the press briefing of 22 April 2020, Dr Arruda returned to this epidemiological analysis, describing it as “scrupulous” and “transparent”. Here is the hallucinating statement that followed a few seconds later:

“I’d like to remind you that every year, under normal circumstances, about 1000 people a month die in long-term care facilities. And basically, it must be understood that the current deaths that we are counting associated with Covid-19, (they) would have occurred despite the situation”.

We are literally telling ourselves that the deaths that have been associated with Covid-19 for more than a month and which are sowing panic in the population would have occurred anyway. One journalist even made this schizophrenic comment: “Don’t you think that underestimates the number of deaths?” It is clear, using common sense (something that some journalists employed by the major media outlets no longer seem to have), that this method of calculation considerably overestimates the number of deaths linked to Covid-19.

Here is another example of this mystifying calculation. On his daily show, posted on the Journal de Montréal website on April 23, 2020, Mario Dumont received Dr. Vinh-Kim Nguyen, an emergency physician at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal. Mr. Dumont was asking questions about how to account for deaths related to Covid-19, as it was questioned whether some of the deaths observed in long-term care facilities were related more to a lack of care than to Covid-19. The following is part of the exchange between Mr. Dumont and Dr. Nguyen (8):

Dr. Nguyen: “What we can do and what the French and other countries are already doing is that in a pandemic state, all deaths are above average. In other words, if today in Quebec we have an average of 58 deaths, and this year we have 82, we’re going to add 24, 24 more, we’re going to attribute (them) to the Covid. We’re not going to look any further, we’re not going to look in the (death) certificates.”

Mr. Dumont: “We are going to assume that the surplus of deaths is related to the pandemic that is in place”.

Dr. Nguyen: “Linked directly or indirectly to the pandemic”.

It is difficult to understand why journalists blissfully accepted this inflationary calculation method without questioning it. The method whereby people are reported to have died from Covid-19 because of epidemiological links or simply because the annual average of deaths would have increased this year defies logic. I believe that the words of Dr. Bhakdi, previously quoted, deserve to be rewritten:

“This violates a basic principle of infectiology”.

There seems to have been an ad hoc way of counting deaths for the purpose of cause, because the mortality rate for seasonal influenza is calculated in a much more conservative way.

In the “Bilan démographique du Québec 2019” prepared by the Institut de la statistique (see note 6), a distinction is made between influenza-related mortality and mortality due to co-morbid conditions. It states

“It is difficult to measure the exact proportion of deaths directly or indirectly attributable to the influenza virus, due in particular to the frequent presence of comorbidity (other concomitant causes of death). Influenza and pneumopathies are frequently cited as a secondary cause of death, and may therefore be involved in more deaths than if they are listed as the primary (main) cause of death”.

This is diametrically opposed to the method of calculation used to establish the mortality of the new coronavirus. Indeed, unlike influenza, the coronavirus is systematically considered as the main cause of death without even carrying out a test and by simple epidemiological links. I reiterate that, as Dr. Arruda stated in a press conference previously cited, all deceased persons with Covid-19-like symptoms were considered to have died of Covid-19.

It should be noted that, according to Dr. Bhakdi’s comments in his open letter to Chancellor Merkel, this method of calculation, which he calls “suspicion of Covid“, is widespread and has probably been used in France, Spain and Italy. These countries have revealed a very high mortality rate from the very beginning of the crisis and have contributed to the atmosphere of fear experienced in the West.

Can it be concluded that the official excess mortality associated with Covid-19 compared to influenza is not real, but depends primarily on the method of calculation?

If we take into account the number of deaths recorded in 2018 associated with problems of the respiratory and circulatory systems, diabetes and malignant tumours, diseases often present in individuals who die with a viral infection, we have a figure of 46,010 deaths in Quebec alone. It is very easy to inflate a statistic if we calculate it in bad faith.

Let us take the analysis a little further. In the same document from the Institut de la statistique du Québec, for example, it says that mortality in Quebec is increasing year after year in a general trend, largely due to the aging of the population. It states that “the provisional estimate of the number of deaths in Quebec in 2018 is 68,600, compared to 66,300 in 2017, an increase of 2,300 or 3.5%.

According to the Covid-19 mortality calculation method described by Dr. Nguyen, this percentage increase would be de facto related to Covid-19 in the pandemic year? Just below, in the same document, it is mentioned that “the increase recorded in 2018 is also related to the severe influenza season of winter 2017-2018“. It is interesting to note that this increase had not, at that time, led to such a generalized upheaval.

As another example that influenza epidemics can have a high case-fatality rate without leading to a generalized shutdown of the system, an article in the Journal de Montréal (9) suggests that about 22 people a day would die from influenza in January 2015. The article states that

“For the month of January 2015 alone, 6900 people died, which represents the highest number of deaths recorded in a single month in recent Quebec history. We can’t say that influenza is entirely to blame, but we can say that it is largely responsible for this excess of deaths”.

In the document from the Institut de la statistique (see nbp 6), emphasis is also placed on the seasonality of deaths, particularly with regard to deaths of the elderly in the winter period:

“There is a fairly strong seasonality in the monthly distribution of the number of deaths. This seasonality varies according to age groups and the various causes of death. Mortality among the young is higher in the summer months due, inter alia, to road accidents and drowning. Among the elderly, the number of deaths increases during the winter months, and as their weight in the number of deaths is overwhelmingly higher, the overall distribution corresponds more to their seasonality”.

The excess mortality of seniors during the winter period is therefore common. Higher mortality peaks in some years than the average are also common.

The multifactorial aspect of deaths attributed to Covid-19 is illustrated by Dr. Bhakdi in his open letter to the German Chancellor (see nbp 7). He mentions, among other things, that the very high air pollution in northern Italy, the part of the country most affected by the epidemic, makes the population vulnerable to lung diseases. The situation would already lead to a significant number of deaths in these areas and it would be difficult to know what the real role of coronavirus in the high mortality observed in Italy is.

The true role of the virus in Italy is totally uncertain for many reasons … because there are exceptional external factors that make these regions particularly vulnerable. One such factor is the increase in air pollution in northern Italy. According to WHO estimates, this situation, even without the virus, led to more than 8,000 additional deaths per year in 2006 in Italy’s 13 largest cities alone. The situation has not changed much since then. Finally, it has also been shown that air pollution significantly increases the risk of viral lung diseases in the very young and elderly.

Instead of establishing a large-scale screening strategy (as South Korea did, for example, when it stopped transmission of the virus without massive containment measures) to target infected people and assess the coronavirus lethality rate as accurately as possible, the West took drastic health emergency measures based on alarmist models and inflationary calculation methods. Contrary to WHO statements, the Covid-19 situation resembles more a common epidemiological situation than a global health crisis. The statements of Dr Didier Raoult, infectiologist and professor at the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) in infectious diseases in Marseille, also support this view. According to the evolution of annual mortality curves, he does not see a significantly higher than normal peak in deaths in the winter of 2019-2020 in France. In a video posted online on 14 April 2020, he mentions (10) :

“For us, the epidemic is gradually disappearing… If we try to see if the current health crisis is having an impact on mortality in France, the answer is no… We are very far away at the moment, if you add up the months from December to March, from the health crisis of 2017 when there were a lot of H3N2 flu. It so happens that this year there are far fewer flues and far fewer RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), which means that the increase in mortality linked to this new virus is not significantly visible in the population as a whole”.

What could be described as statistical fraud has been observed worldwide. In the United States, a few doctors had the courage to speak out and said they felt pressured to indicate on death certificates that Covid-19 was the leading cause of patient mortality. In a video posted on youtube, a video quickly removed by the same channel (11), Dr. Daniel Erickson, an emergency physician in Bakersfield, California, said:

“We’re talking about co-morbidities… Covid was part of the clinical picture, that’s not why they died, folks! That was one of the reasons, so to be so simplistic and say it’s a Covid death because they had Covid, do you know how many people die with pneumonia, or how many people die with the flu, or should I say with the flu? … Their lungs are weakened by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, they had a heart attack two years ago, they’re in poor health. There’s no incentive to test for the flu… But I was talking to a friend who said, you know it’s interesting, when I write my death report, I get pressure to write “Covid”. Why is it like that? Why are we being pressured to write “Covid”? To maybe inflate the numbers and make them look worse than they are? I think so.

Note that in this video, Dr. Erickson exposes with independent statistics (with no media filter) that the new coronavirus is no more lethal than seasonal flu.

Dr. Annie Bukacek , a physician in Kalispell, Montana, says essentially the same thing. She says that on the website of the Center of disease control and prevention (CDC; the lead federal public health agency in the United States), mortality data include both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19. According to the CDC’s instructions, physicians would be encouraged to make diagnoses of Covid-19 on the basis of simple assumptions. She states (12) :

“The CDC counts real Covid-19 cases and hypothetical Covid-19 cases, as if they were the same thing, they call them Covid-19 deaths… They automatically overestimate the true number of deaths by their own admission… You can be sure that the actual number (of deaths) is substantially lower than what you are told”.

Minnesota physician and Senator Dr. Scott Jensen describes a similar situation in an interview with journalist Chris Berg (13):

“Last Friday I received a 7-page document that somehow told me that if I had an 86-year-old patient who had pneumonia but had never been tested for Covid-19, but who later died of pneumonia and was found to have been in contact with her son who had no symptoms but later tested positive for Covid-19, it would be appropriate to put on the Covid-19 death certificate…. If someone has pneumonia in the middle of a flu outbreak, and I don’t have a test for influenza, I will not put a diagnosis of influenza on the death certificate. I will write that person died of pneumonia”.

Dr. Jensen went on to mention that medical practice normally requires diagnoses to be made on the basis of facts and not supposition, contrary to what they are currently required to do with Covid-19. The reporter Berg asked him why then, in his opinion, he was receiving this kind of instruction and what would be the purpose of distorting the statistics in this way.

“Well, fear is an excellent way to control the world. I worry that sometimes you’re just interested in making fear go up”.

If all flu epidemics in the past had been treated the same way by health authorities and the media, we would be in a constant state of panic. Need I remind you, it is the false mortality statistics, this false idea of dangerousness to our lives, hammered home night and morning by the mass media, that have contributed to the climate of collective fear and justified all the containment measures and infringements of rights and freedoms that we have suffered in the spring of 2020.

I would like to mention here that this is not to minimize the deaths of those who were truly affected by Covid-19. The pain of the families of the victims is real and cannot be denied, just like the pain of the families of victims of other causes of death. It is a question of analyzing the ins and outs of the crisis we have been plunged into, because although people have died from Covid-19, especially among the elderly, it does not appear that the situation is statistically very different from mortality from other seasonal viral infections.

Are we collectively Molière’s imaginary patient? Sick for fear of being sick; who begs for his therapy to be saved to the great joy of a greedy and overcautious medicine. If this is the case, the decisions taken by public health must be denounced, especially given the social and economic impacts they have had. Among these impacts are deaths and lives that should also have been saved.

Medical and media authorities say that containment has saved lives. They also claim that limiting the transmission of the virus in order to flatten the curve has avoided overflowing the emergency room and thus facilitated the allocation of care to sick patients. This last point is relevant because this unknown virus may have required erring on the side of caution rather than the other way around. The complications – often non-lethal – associated with Covid-19 can cause major stress to health care teams and this aspect deserves to be highlighted. But again, does the strategy of designating certain receiving hospitals to receive Covid-19 patients not increase the problem of overcrowding? By distributing patients across the emergency departments of all hospitals, as is usually done, we might also have distributed the workload. In Quebec, on the other hand, there does not seem to have been a congestion problem. When the media talk about an outbreak problem in a hospital, it does not mean that there is an overflow in that hospital. It means that the virus has spread across the floors, not that there is a shortage of beds.

Based on the information we have just reviewed, there is every indication that there is something fishy going on. This massive containment, based on predictions and inflated numbers, looks like a bazooka crushing everything in its path as it tries to kill a fly. Several specialists question the containment strategy, claiming that it does not correspond to good epidemiological practice. Good practice would rather require diagnosing, treating and isolating the sick, but allowing the healthy population to circulate and collectively immunize themselves. Jean-Dominique Michel, a Swiss anthropologist and public health expert, is one of those who think this way (14).

(14) “We then adopted measures that were absolutely contrary to good practice: we gave up screening people who might be ill and confined the population as a whole to stop the spread of the virus. These measures were in fact medieval and problematic since they only slowed down the epidemic at the risk of potentially even worse rebound phenomena. And that they lock up everyone while only a small minority is concerned”.

Dr Didier Raoult, in a video posted online on 17 March 2020, comes to the same conclusion. He proposes that confinement is not necessary, even deleterious (15).

“There are real logistical, pragmatic, rational measures to put in place and treat it like a normal disease. But if at the same time we set the fire and say you’re all going to die… It’s not possible to panic the population with something that won’t change the mortality statistics, I mean there won’t be more deaths than there were in previous years, that’s not true… Listen for what I saw quickly, the three countries whose situation is not currently controlled are Italy, France and Spain, so they’re probably not models. So the confinement in Italy doesn’t prevent it from continuing to evolve exponentially. It continues to evolve exponentially in France and Spain, and these three countries have decided to put containment at the forefront. We can ask ourselves whether we should not think about it, now accept to change our opinion, which is a form of intelligence under the pressure of events, and start again on what Korea has done, that is to say multiply the tests, treat people and isolate only the positive people… And when they are no longer contagious, we must leave them in peace. It’s not worth keeping them for 14 days if they’re negative after 5 days, it’s no longer science, it’s science fiction or I don’t know what, witchcraft”.

There is no consensus in the scientific community on the strategy of containment and closure of businesses and industries. Sweden, which has not opted for this massive containment strategy, has been strongly criticized and portrayed as the bad pupil in the majority of the media. However, a Swedish epidemiologist, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes that containment has no scientific basis and that Sweden will have more or less the same record as the other Scandinavian countries at the end of the crisis (16). Dr. Daniel Erickson is also of the opinion that the containment strategy is questionable. As he mentions (see nbp 11):

“If you’re playing with people’s constitutional rights, you better have a good reason, not just a theory. The data show us that it is time to lift the containment orders. So if we don’t lift them, what’s the reason?”.

According to Dr. Erickson, confinement is even deleterious to the immune system of healthy people. Our immune system is strengthened by contact with viruses and bacteria and weakened in a sanitized environment.

Banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel, closing schools, shutting down several economic sectors and putting a halt to several health care services (physical and mental) have caused so many problems at various levels that the remedy imposed by health authorities has made society sicker than the coronavirus. There is no justification for the social and economic crisis into which we have been plunged.

It is safe to say that the tragedy that has occurred in seniors’ homes in Quebec and elsewhere is a direct result of the climate of panic caused by the WHO and the PSD through their distorted data. Already limited human resources in CHLSD and hospital centres have been undermined by the desertion of several employees who were frightened by a virus that was presented to them as a killer, but which, on balance, looks like a scarecrow. The seniors who died in CHSLDs during the health emergency surely died more from negligence and the consequent deterioration of their state of health than from the Covid.19 The virus was presented to them as a killer, but in the end it looks like a scarecrow. We even heard grieving families, who were forbidden to visit their sick relatives, say that their sick relatives had let themselves go because of a lack of human contact and care. In addition, there have been and will continue to be collateral deaths resulting from the suspension of several medical services (e.g., cardiology, oncology) that have led to the postponement of surgeries and diagnostic evaluations that are so important to people’s health. In addition, there were psychological problems and suicides related to the disastrous consequences of the system shutdown, particularly among people with fragile mental health or those who had put all their savings into their small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). And what can we say about the frightening deconfinement that is being proposed to us and will direct our children to a school or daycare centre that they no longer recognize, framed by austere rules and masked educators.

At a time when the data on mortality rates are being drastically revised downwards, it is my opinion that the governments and the DSPs that constantly support the need for containment and social distancing to protect themselves against a pseudo-health danger are directly responsible for the crisis and its impacts (the Trudeau administration and the Canadian DSP are particularly buoyant in this discourse).

The mainstream media, particularly the television news, which slavishly and almost without nuance relay the authorities’ fallacious discourse, are also responsible. They have abandoned their role as public watchdogs. Their mandate to inform the public by giving them access to facts and a diversity of opinions in order to encourage informed reflection has been vilely relegated to oblivion. Rather, it is the citizens themselves and the alternative media that give voice to dissent and the scientific facts necessary for the development of critical thinking. The situation is certainly not new, but it has been unequivocally exposed in recent months.

The crisis we are experiencing is not a global health crisis, but a political crisis, a clear illustration of the failure of our governmental and media institutions. The members of these institutions have blood on their hands, for their incompetence and even bad faith have caused the collapse of existing human systems and the resulting social and health distress. Again, let us applaud the tremendous work done by the people at the grassroots level: the health workers, the transport workers, the emergency services, the county MPs, the teachers who have offered online courses and so on. The solidarity of the common people has been extraordinary and I hope it will maintain the social fabric that the political and media elites are trying to tear apart. We will have to be strong, because we will only be able to gauge the full impact of this crisis in several months, if not years.

It is towards this horizon that our gaze must now turn, because the convinced reader is well aware that this crisis is surely not caused for nothing.

– What can lead governments to take such a course of action?

– What interest can medical authorities and their media outlets have in panicking people?

– Have the authorities been caught up in the intensity and suddenness of the crisis?

– As some have imagined, were they caught repairing a plane that broke in midair?

The current state of the world leads me to believe that the reality is not so light. A few whistleblowers have already lent their voices to denounce this emergency situation, which has insidiously led us to a society where civil liberties are being eroded (17). (17) The ban on gathering under penalty of a fine, incitement to denunciation, police control of movements, espionage by geolocation and the use of tracking drones, and soon mandatory vaccination and the health passport are all measures that are incompatible with a free and democratic society. In the space of a few weeks, they have become acceptable in the eyes of public opinion.

We can believe these temporary measures, but history suggests otherwise. The Patriot Act that followed the World Trade Center attacks in 2001 and the emergency measures introduced in France following the attacks of 13 November 2015 have “become a permanent part of the law and common customs of these two countries” (18). If we must judge the tree by its fruits, we must judge the source of the crisis by its effects. And if the effects of the crisis are the collapse (19) of the economy and the advent of an increasingly controlled society, it is perhaps because the road to crisis was already paved. Social, fiscal and monetary reforms await us in the wake of recent events. I do not believe that this pandemic is a plane that we are trying to repair in mid-flight.

It is a planned, structured and strategic crisis. Developing this hypothesis would require far too much analysis to be done with sufficient clarity in such a short article. I reserve this task for another book in the hopefully near future. The analysis of the Covid-19 data seems to me too pressing a necessity to defer its publication and this article has been written in this awareness of time. Resistance to the lies of political-media elites requires dialogue and rapid information sharing, especially in the age of the Internet where this information is freely available and can serve as a shield against mass media propaganda.

Nevertheless, let us take the time to conclude with a reflection on the current state of the political world. We are “at war,” says French President Emmanuel Macron. A worrying term, carefully chosen rhetoric, it puts the people on the alert and makes them docile. We are at war with a virus that has a mortality rate roughly similar to influenza? We are at war with a virus that kills mostly the elderly and sick, who are vulnerable year after year to seasonal viral infections? I personally believe that the war we are fighting is an information war. In the times to come, we will be bombarded with alarming speeches, including the one on the rebound of the epidemic and the second wave.

We have heard the WHO’s speeches about the uncertainty of herd immunity and the probable resurgence of contamination. According to several experts, this possibility is, on the contrary, unlikely because the new coronavirus seems to follow a typical spread curve marked by a sharp increase and a continuous decrease in infected cases (20). Dr Didier Raoult even describes the idea of a second wave as “fanciful” because it is based on the memory of the Spanish flu which would have been, in history, an exception to the rule (21). As far as immunity is concerned, to catch a respiratory virus and not die from it means having developed antibodies against it. It is true that in some individuals, several infections are necessary before they are immune. Nevertheless, herd immunity is a reality that is demonstrated by a simple historical study of epidemics (22).

That won’t stop the terror merchants from selling us the danger. He who controls people’s fear becomes the master of their souls, Machiavelli said (23). To succeed in shaking our economic and social systems, the crisis must be long, very long. The WHO has already proposed abusive means to stem the pandemic. Dr Michael Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO’s Health Emergency Programme, proposed on 30 March this measure, which is beyond comprehension (24):

“In most parts of the world, because of containment, most of the transmission currently occurring in many countries is occurring in the home, at the family level. In a sense, transmission has been taken out of the streets and pushed back into the family unit. Now we have to go into families to find those people who might be sick and remove them, and isolate them, in a safe and dignified way.

A highly influential global organization tells us that, pro bono, people should be sought out in their homes to be removed and isolated away from their families. This does not seem to have been put into action, but illustrates the state of panic in which people are being put. In order to get people to accept such vexatious measures, fear must be rampant. A large number of people are already caught up in this fabricated fear. And any means can be good to maintain it, or even amplify it. That is why political resistance to the liberticidal tendencies of governments is actively needed. It is essential that the people welcome the suggestions and decisions of the authorities with a great deal of scepticism. Asking questions, doubting, checking, talking and disobeying are citizen weapons within our reach. Free thought is still not in confinement. It is up to the people still in love with their freedom to use it.

And that’s what freedom is all about. From the book of Exodus to La Boétie’s Discourse of Voluntary Servitude, from the Orwellian Big Brother to the roots of totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, the question of freedom has not taken a wrinkle. Perhaps this is where contemporary men and women are going astray: believing that the fight for freedom is a thing of the past, no longer distrusting their government and relying on its good offices. As the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec stated in a previously quoted article (see no. 17):

“The dictator is not born of himself. He is born from the fact that the citizen wishes to be protected”.

Today, the masks are coming off. Dictatorship is being revealed more than ever in its international form. We have witnessed how a crisis in Asia can, in the space of a few weeks, very similarly affect the lives and rights and freedoms of different populations overseas. The fate of national peoples is more closely linked than ever before: the global coordination of public health operations under the auspices of the WHO, the talk of a world government, the proposal for a world currency. These are not just dystopian anguish fantasies, but more or less imminent realities that some people have been thinking about for a long time.

For Arendt, totalitarianism is a dynamic of destruction of reality and social structures, more than a political regime. She describes it as international in its organisation, universal in its ideological aim, planetary in its political aspirations (25). (25) The current situation cannot be better described. The nations of the world are faced with a globalist cabal that relies on fear to govern them. This governance is today unofficial and rests on its tentacles such as the WHO, the United Nations (UN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Tomorrow, at the turn of a major crisis, it could become official.

It is to this end that chaos and anguish will set in among the population. The war on communism, the war on Islamic terrorism, the war on climate change and now the war on viruses; the object is variable, the fear constant (26). (26) The political authorities pose as protectors of the vulnerable and frightened citizen. The solution proposed, or even imposed, is to barter freedom for security. Give up your freedom in exchange for more security and you will end up losing both, as the saying goes. This is a delicate balance that sometimes leans towards a point of no return.

“It is the people who enslave themselves, who cut their throats, who, having the choice of being serf or free, renounce their independence and take the yoke … all men, as long as they have something human, allow themselves to be subjugated for only two reasons, by constraint or by deception” (27).

Once deception has been unmasked, there is no longer any reason to give up one’s freedom. Unless we have nothing human left.

(19) With the amount of liquidity injected into the system (5 trillion invested by the G20 countries – central banks buying back hundreds of billions of dollars in stock and bond securities) added to the astronomical amount of new money already created by quantitative easing policies since the 2008 crisis, the money supply has become immeasurable. With interest rates ridiculously low, even negative in some countries, classical economics and history make a simple prognosis. A currency that is so cheap becomes unstable and weakens, inflation gallops and gnaws away at purchasing power, the value of money and certain assets inevitably erodes (pensions, life insurance policies etc.). False wealth based on credit, money-debt, comes to the end of its cycle. The abrupt shutdown of the economy will cause bankruptcies, credit managers will take over the management of production. As in any economic crisis, wealth is not lost, it is transferred. The political and economic elites, these pyromaniac firefighters, are proposing solutions that a people on its knees cannot refuse.

(26) In what they call the “fabrication of consent,” Herman and Chomsky describe the media filter through which government agencies and big business promote their interests. Opinion control mechanisms require a target to focus on in order to distract the population from the real aims of these state and private bodies. Chomsky suggests that at the turn of the 21st century, the war on terrorism has replaced anti-communism as the main control mechanism. Sources: Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky.

Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the media are always involved, voluntarily or indirectly, in creating a climate of fear to “manufacture opinion”. Arguably, the current alarmist rhetoric about health disasters is part of these control mechanisms to influence public and economic policies to the detriment of the people (LoA).

783,1602,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/05/20/food-prices-soar-coronavirus-covid-19/5226969002/,2020-05-20,Food prices soar to highest one-month increase since 1974; price of eggs up 16% in April,"DETROIT – As more Americans stayed home in April because of COVID-19, they cooked more home meals.

And they paid the price for it. Literally.

Grocery store bills shot up April, showing the biggest monthly increase in nearly 50 years, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistic's monthly Consumer Price Index report.

While overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.

Price increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest.

Mary Kay Ash of Clinton Township, Michigan, is among those who have noticed their average weekly grocery receipts are on the rise. The 54-year-old mom says she typically spent about $100 to $125 a week on groceries for a family of four adults before the pandemic. Now, she says, she is spending $140 to $150.

Target sales up 11%:Retailer's Drive Up and Shipt delivery grew by 278% fueled by COVID-19

'The new way':Businesses pivot by selling care packages, virtual events to survive coronavirus pandemic

Her shopping plan means getting to the store early Sunday mornings. She shops in produce first, then heads over to the meat department to see what's available.

Ash said she has noticed grocery prices are up, especially on meat, but also on just about everything, including produce.

Regional CPI statistics are reported on a bimonthly basis. The most current report showed consumers in metro Detroit, for instance, paid 3.3% more for groceries from February to April, the Labor Department said.

Increases reflect classic supply-and-demand economics. Disruptions in the food supply linked to meat processing plant closures and slowdowns, along with a shift in production from restaurants and institutions to retail, led to increases. You can also toss in panic buying.

Several food categories had steep increases.

Prices in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category had the biggest monthly increase as consumers paid 4.3% more for those items in April. Prices were nearly 7% higher over the last 12 months.

When broken out into individual products, egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.

But now, wholesale shell egg prices are at a level closer to what they are expected to be, said Trey Malone, Michigan State University agriculture economist.

""Trend lines in eggs had a massive spike in April and now, as of May 18, it's down,"" said Malone.

Multiple regulations by the federal government were relaxed to allow the shell egg industry to shift supply of eggs from restaurants to retail, Malone said.

The USDA's May 18 Egg News Report has wholesale prices of eggs averaging about $1 a dozen.

While Malone is convinced that overall prices have increased, it's not entirely clear how the CPI goes out and looks at prices in the middle of a pandemic.

""What the CPI is telling you here is something that is changing rapidly,"" he said.

Malone expect price increases to continue at least on the meat side because of a decrease in supply of animals. Contributing to that is the euthanizing of animals by farmers because some processing plants were down with sick workers and an increase in exports.

With pork, Malone also cites a jump in demand for pork exports. Before COVID-19, China was hit with an African swine fever in hogs.

Grocery pork prices were up 3% in April. What's also going on is there's a shortage of certain pork cuts.

""In the U.S., we've gotten very comfortable with this proliferation of options at the grocery stores,"" Malone said. ""Right now, the system is having to flex in a way that we are just going to have to expect there's a limited, smaller number of items in the market while simultaneously the prices will increase. ""

Uncooked ground beef was up 4.8% in April, beef roasts were up 5% and beef steaks saw a 2.1% jump, the Labor Department said. Year over year, ground beef was up a whopping 9.7%.

Ground beef prices have taken Ash by surprise during this pandemic. She has seen packages of ground round or chuck selling as high as $9 a pound.

It's become a grocery store game with Ash and her fiancé where they try to find a cut of meat that's affordably priced and buy two.

""Then I plan my meals from that,"" Ash said. ""It's seems pork was the best buy and still is, so I've been doing many dishes with boneless pork loin.""

While food prices increased, they were offset by lower prices for energy. Year-over-year gas prices were down 32%. Other categories less food and energy that showed decreases included apparel and transportation.

Here's a sampling of some items that increased the most in April:

Apples: 4.9%

Bread 3.7%

Cookies 5.1%

Fresh sweet rolls, coffeecakes, doughnuts: 5%

Hot dogs: 5.7%

Pork chops: 7.4%

Poultry: 5.8%

Many claim that the Democrats want open borders to import millions of new voters who will likely vote for Democrats.

Undeniably this is an accurate statement but only partially addresses the strategy behind the Democrats’ push for open borders and an end to immigration law enforcement as optimized by the creation of “Sanctuary Cities” and Sanctuary States and immigration mayhem that ensues.

Today’s Democrats bear no resemblance to the Democrats of the past. Today’s Radical Democrats are hell-bent on seizing permanent political power at the expense of America and Americans.

Traditional Democrats supported American workers and addressed their concerns while Republicans backed up business owners’ goals of fewer regulations and greater profits. This balance made sense and helped Americans and America to prosper.

My dad used to say that the easiest way to turn capitalists into communists is to take away their money. Flooding America with millions of Third World workers who bring Third World expectations of Third World wages and working conditions results in the loss of jobs by millions of American and lawful immigrant workers and the suppression of wages for all workers.

Homeless rates soar as the cost of housing increases as more foreigners come to the United States and seek housing. The increased demand for apartments drives up the price of housing even as jobs are lost and wages fail to keep up with increased costs of housing.

As more Americans lose their jobs and the ability to support themselves and their families- even if they don’t lose their jobs, they will be drawn to the Democratic Party candidates who offer to provide Americans and aliens alike with economic assistance that they desperately need to survive.

Consider the May 12, 2020 news report published by PJ Media, Democrats' $3 Trillion Bill Would Include a Massive Gift...to Communist China.

There are many elements of the proposed emergency funding bill concocted by Nancy “Let them eat ice cream” Pelosi and her fellow travelers of the Radical Democratic Party that have absolutely nothing to do with assisting struggling Americans and small businesses that were ordered shuttered because of the Coronavirus Pandemic that has sickened millions and has killed an estimated 80,000 Americans, thus far. One of the most egregious components of this bill has been ignored by the media that is addressed by PJ Media.

Here is the relevant excerpt:

They’ve also prioritized China’s economy in this one. The bill includes a provision that waives Chapter 83 of title 41, United States Code. What’s that? Chapter 83 of title 41, United States Code, shall not apply with respect to purchases made in response to the emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020, under section 501 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191) and under any subsequent major disaster declaration under section 401 of such Act that supersedes such emergency declaration. Chapter 83 of Title 41, United States Code is none other than the Buy American Act. That 1933 law prioritizes American manufacturers over others when the government makes purchases. The Trump administration strengthened the Buy American act last year. The Democrats’ bill would waive it permanently, allowing the government to purchase more goods from overseas, unrestricted.

Consider that the afore-noted Buy American Act was enacted by a traditional Democrat, President FDR who acted to protect American jobs and manufacturing the year after the Stock Market cratered on July 8, 1932 and stocks hit their lowest point. Roosevelt also ramped up immigration law enforcement to protect jobs for American workers.

The Buy American Act requires that the federal government must prioritize the purchase of supplies from American companies when such made in America supplies are available.

This is commonsense and helps America and Americans.

Yet during the current crisis the Democrats want to eliminate this requirement that protects American jobs that has been on the books for nearly 90 years. They are exploiting the pandemic crisis as a means for pressuring the Republicans and the President into ending this important long-standing law.

I doubt that any so-called journalists will even report on this major betrayal, let alone ask Pelosi or any other Democrat about why they included this provision in their proposed legislation.

It is clear that they seek to destroy more jobs Americans desperately need, especially in this post coronavirus era where tens of millions of Americans fear that they will have lost their jobs permanently when the U.S. economy slowly reopens.

Their proposed legislation would also provide amnesty to illegal aliens declaring aliens working illegally in the United States as “Essential Workers” even as many Americans have been kept from working because purportedly their jobs are un-essential!

If the Democrats were truly concerned about the plight of American and lawful immigrant workers and their struggling families, they should favor immigration law enforcement and suggest that for the meanwhile Americans should be able to take “essential jobs” to help them get through this unparalleled crisis.

Remember the Democrats’ mantra, “Never let a crisis go to waste.”

This crisis has emboldened Radical Democrat’s to push an agenda that destroys the American middle class to propel more Americans into homelessness and dependency on the Democrats.

Indeed, the Democrats continue to push for passage of “Comprehensive Immigration Reform” a legislative disaster I have come to refer to as the Overwhelm America Act.

On Sunday May 17, 2020 New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio was interviewed on Fox News by Maria Bartiromo. Fox posted the video under the title, Mayor de Blasio: New York City will likely see more revenue losses without a stimulus.

During the interview de Blasio referred to the supposed “12 million undocumented folks” to describe the population of illegal aliens which has been estimated to be nearly double that number. That number, however, is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

If legalized, everyone of those millions of illegal aliens would have the absolute and immediate right to bring in each and everyone of their minor children and their spouses as lawful immigrants. Third World countries have many, many children.

It is not uncommon for such families to have more than six children each. Additionally aliens could claim to have fathered children with women who are not their spouses. It is entirely possible that each legalized alien could, on average, petition for more than three children each, considering that some aliens might not have minor children, don’t want them here or already brought them to the United States.

If, for the sake of argument, 25 million illegal aliens were given lawful status- and that number could be much, much larger, we could wind up with more than 75 million minor children being brought legally to the United States by this ill-conceived program, along with their other parent.

In other words, Comprehensive Immigration Reform could enable more than 100 million new immigrants to legally come to the United States, literally overnight!

Imagine the impact that tens of millions of children this would have on our schools, hospitals, mass transit, the power grid and other elements of critical infrastructure. The cost of housing would climb still higher leading to more poverty, more homelessness and more crime.

When those tens of millions of immigrant children become adults they will flood the over-flowing labor pool.

Finally, if our political leaders would be sufficiently corrupt and stupid to provide an unknown number of illegal aliens with lawful status, there would be no way to interview these millions of illegal aliens who either entered the United States without inspection and/or violated multiple immigration laws after entering the United States. There would be no way to conduct field investigations to verify the claims made in their application and to identify fraud.

Immigration fraud was identified by the 9/11 Commission, to which I provided testimony, as the key method of entry and embedding for terrorists.

This is why I have also come to refer to Comprehensive Immigration Reform by another name, the “Terrorist Assistance and Facilitation Act” as I noted in an Op-Ed I wrote for the Washington Times Immigration bill a 'No Go' and that was quoted by then-Senator Jeff Sessions when he persuaded members of the U.S. Senate to vote down that terrible bill in 2007.

I also used that descriptive title in my responses to written questions from Senator Chuck Grassley when I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on March 20 2013 on the topic Building An Immigration System Worthy Of American Values.

Decent Americans are horrified by the growing number of homeless Americans. The immoral Radical Democrats, however, are encouraged that their strategy to force Americans to trade their freedoms for food, shelter and other necessities is working.

For Radical Democrats, winning isn’t everything- it is the only thing!",fake
786,1180,https://www.businessinsider.com/law-firms-are-cutting-short-summer-associate-programs-amid-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-16,"Some rising lawyers are getting paid $3,600 a week to do nothing this summer as the coronavirus cripples associate programs","Law firms normally have hands-on summer programs for law students, mostly after their second year in law school, that lets them bond and get a feel for law-firm life.

But some of the top firms in the country, including Kirkland & Ellis, Davis Polk, Cravath, and Sidley Austin, are moving summer associate programs online, partly or fully, and cutting them short.

Many of the most profitable firms are paying students for the full length of the program – more than $3,600 per week – even if they're shortening it.

Less profitable firms tend to be pro-rating pay, or offering stipends or advances, causing some summer associates to stress about their finances.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The top law firms in the US tend to have a regimented hiring process that has been drastically disrupted by the coronavirus, leaving hundreds of rising lawyers with little to do this summer – even if they're still getting paid $3,600 a week.

Summer associate programs are a rite of passage for thousands of law students wrapping up their second, or 2L, year in law school. The recruiting process for such roles starts in the fall of the 2L year, and most summers can expect to eventually get an offer for full-time work once they graduate, assuming they pass the bar exam after their 3L year.

The pandemic has led to delays throughout the process, however. States including New York and California have canceled the July bar exam, and several law firms that normally start their first-years in the fall have said they won't be onboarding the incoming class until some point in 2021.

Law firms that typically start their programs in May – like Davis Polk & Wardwell, which had planned to have 133 summer associates worldwide starting on May 4 – are delaying them to June or July.

Read more: Big Law M&A work is evaporating as coronavirus spreads, but some firms are about to make bank. Here are the winners and losers.

Most are trimming them down to six, four, or even two weeks and moving them online, at least to start. Cravath, Swaine & Moore is starting its six-week program virtually on June 15, although it's possible that it may transition to the office. And Sidley Austin, whose program will run from July 6 to July 31, has told summers that it will still pay them for 10 weeks and is designing a ""robust and engaging"" virtual program

One reason firms say they're cutting back is because the social aspect of the summer associate experience – a big part of it — is hard to replicate virtually. Kevin Iredell, a spokesman for law firm Lowenstein Sandler, said the firm's summers traditionally go to happy hours, dinners, a cruise around Manhattan and a Major League Baseball game. But the MLB has indefinitely delayed the start of its season, and bans on large gatherings have all but eliminated prospects for dining out.

""Right now it'll be mostly virtual, but we're still holding out hope that we'll be able to host some in-person events,"" Iredell said in an email. ""That will all be dependent on the state restrictions.""

Another compelling reason to cut back on summer programs is financial. Law firms large and small have already trimmed salaries and furloughed staff and lawyers. While summers might have hoped to spend more time doing supervised legal work – drafting memos and the like – some firms just don't think it's worth the investment of time.

""Most in-house legal teams do not allow law firms to charge for summer students, nor first-year associates,"" Nancey Watson, a legal pricing consultant, said in an email.

One of the strongest predictors of which law firms are offering their summers full pay is the firm's profit per equity partner, or PPEP. Many of the firms that are promising to pay their summers in full, regardless of the length of the program, netted more than $3 million per equity partner last year. Less profitable firms have been more likely to shrink pay to match the shorter programs or to provide a small stipend, although there have been exceptions.

The cuts can be difficult for some rising lawyers – many of whom are in the midst of final exams – to handle. On online forums like Reddit and TopLawSchools, they fret about canceling leases and paying debts with far less income than they'd budgeted for. Some say they've managed to find research-assistant work with professors, while others are still looking for other sources of income.

One summer associate at a large law firm whose expected income was cut by more than $20,000 told Business Insider he's considering taking on additional work in a grocery store or a warehouse to make up for it.

For summer associates who are more financially secure, boredom could become an issue. At Kirkland & Ellis, the country's top-grossing firm, which last year had more than 300 summer associates, what for many was a 10-week program has been trimmed to just two weeks of virtual programming. They are still being paid for the original length of their commitment.

Kirkland and some other firms that have shortened or canceled their summer programs are also trying to assuage summers' concerns by guaranteeing that they'll have a job at the firm once they graduate.

Many firms are encouraging their rising lawyers to volunteer. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett has trimmed its 10-week program to five weeks online, and it will pay summers for eight weeks. But it will also tack on a $7,500 stipend – just over two weeks' worth of pay – for summers who commit to pro bono legal work, like helping poor criminal defendants, or other volunteering, like food drives, it told summers in an email seen by Business Insider.

""Our hope is that each of our summer associates will contribute in a safe and positive way to their communities, or other communities in need, as we all look for ways to ease the burden brought on by the pandemic,"" the email said.

Nathan Peart, a recruiter at Major, Lindsey & Africa, said many firms are trying to structure pro bono opportunities on top of their virtual programming. He said law firms can't replicate the ""natural connections"" that can happen in an office, but are still trying to build bonds with summer associates by setting up one-on-one conversations with lawyers and other mentorship activities.

""It's a rolling-our-sleeves-up attitude,"" he said. ""Everyone's trying the best they can.""",real

(Reuters) - Nearly all 50 U.S. states have begun to allow some businesses to reopen and residents to move more freely, but only 14 states have met the federal government's guidelines for lifting measures aimed at fighting the pandemic, according to a Reuters analysis.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended states wait until their daily number of new COVID-19 cases falls for 14 days before easing social distancing restrictions.
Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania have reported four to five weeks of declines in new cases, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.
Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island have reported declines for two weeks, the analysis showed.
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR in an external browser for a Reuters interactive)When asked by Reuters for comment, the CDC referred questions to the White House coronavirus task force. A White House representative did not respond to questions about how many states have met the CDC guidelines to reopen. White House officials have been saying for weeks that they believe there are many states that can safely reopen.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned on Tuesday that prematurely ending restrictions on commerce and social life could have dire consequences.
""There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control and, in fact, paradoxically, will set you back, not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery,"" Fauci told Congress.
Nationally, new cases of COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are down 11% in the last week, according to the Reuters analysis. However, hot spots are emerging in some southern and western states, while the Northeast has seen new infections plunge.
Nineteen of the states with at least 5,000 reported cases of COVID-19 are seeing infections rise, Reuters found.
Many state governors, concerned about the economic fallout from prolonged lockdowns, have said they would lift restrictions carefully and gradually, requiring businesses to maintain physical distance from customers and clean surfaces frequently.
HOT SPOTSKentucky had the largest surge in new cases in the nation with a 60% rise in the first week of May, due to widespread testing at a prison that revealed an outbreak. Alabama's new cases rose 41% even before retail stores, bars and salons reopened. In Mississippi, where diners are allowed inside restaurants, infections were up 19%.
Minnesota had the second-highest increase in new cases, up over 50% in early May, in part due to expanded testing of anyone with symptoms. Previously only a limited number of ill patients could get a test.
Several western states are also seeing new cases rise. Washington state grappled with a devastating outbreak at a nursing home early in the U.S. epidemic but got new infections under control. In the past week, new cases have risen nearly 13%, even as only a few counties have allowed restaurants and other businesses to reopen.
New cases in California, which has maintained fairly strict lockdown measures, rose 14% in the last week. In Arizona, new infections rose over 17%.
Analysts looking at cell phone data have reported an increase of movement around the country, even in states that have yet to reopen.
WHERE NEW CASES ARE DECLININGThe main reason that new cases are down nationally is due to 33% declines in both New York and New Jersey -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- in the past week.
New York does not plan to lift any restrictions until at least May 15, while New Jersey has opened only outdoor recreation, such as state and county parks and golf courses.
Cases in nearby Massachusetts, which remains mostly under lockdown, have fallen 26% and cases are down 12% in Rhode Island, where retail stores can reopen with limits on the number of customers.
Tennessee, one of the first states to reopen restaurants and retail stores, has seen the biggest drop in new cases in the nation, down nearly 49%. Michigan, which remains mostly closed except for manufacturing and auto plants, saw new cases drop 43%.

Their dislike of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has not softened even a little in the four years since she ran against him. Certainly, she turns off others for a variety of reasons, but when she strikes back at Trump, it really hurts.

Thursday, Clinton pointed her rapier wit at the president for being hypocritical, lying, and threatening. She noted that he voted by mail, too:

‘Trump himself votes by mail but is spreading lies and making threats to prevent his fellow Americans from pursuing the same option during an epidemic. It’s clear we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box this fall.’

The thing is that all of the president’s men have told him Republicans only win when they manage to limit the number of people who can vote. If people can vote by mail, say during a coronavirus pandemic, they will vote him out of office.

Clinton is right when she said “we’ll have to work to protect safe access to the ballot box.” It is hard to shut down a voting location when the vote goes by mail. A number of states already have full access to voting by mail, and that may be one reason POTUS has been trying to take down the post office. Never mind that American veterans get all of their medications through the mail.

There will be other ways that Trump tries to limit people’s Constitutional right to vote.

Twitter world went nuts at Clinton getting under Trump’s skin — both pro and con. Check out some of their responses below:

Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up.Good morning. President Trump is disbanding his coronavirus task force. More kids are getting sick. And the meat shortage is getting worse. But let’s start with a virus success story.No lockdown, little virusThe New York Times’s staff members in Hong Kong — like many other workers there — returned to their offices on Monday for the first time in six weeks. They did so after the local government eased some coronavirus restrictions.
To get into the building that houses the Times bureau, reporters and editors had to wear a mask and walk through a thermal scanner that took their temperature. In the elevator, they found a small table with hand sanitizer and tissues, as well as a trash can. Only half of the staff comes into the office at any one time.
This is the new normal in Hong Kong — both very different from before the virus and very different from an American-style lockdown.
Subway workers clean handrails frequently. Restaurants are open, with tables spaced five feet apart. Diners are often given a small paper bag in which to put their mask — so it doesn’t infect the table, or vice versa, as Adrienne Carter, The Times’s Asia editor, told me.
Entrance to Hong Kong is limited mostly to residents, all of whom are tested and quarantined, even if the test is negative. And residents wear masks despite 90-degree heat. “They’re so hot,” Adrienne says. “But it feels second nature to me at this point.”
The most important point: Hong Kong’s strategy is working extremely well.It hasn’t reported a new homegrown case in more than two weeks. Over all, only about 1,000 people — out of 7.5 million — have tested positive. Only four have died.
It’s a sign that a lockdown isn’t the only way to battle the virus. But it’s also a reminder of how different life in a post-reopening United States will be from life in countries that have most effectively stopped the virus’s spread.
Adrienne has lived most of her life in the U.S., and I asked her how well she thought Hong Kong’s strategy could be transferred to today’s United States. “I’m not sure any of it is going to fly,” she said.
Related: “The coronavirus scenario I can’t stop thinking about is the one where we simply get used to all the dying,” Charlie Warzel writes in Opinion.
THE MORNING FIVE1. The end of Trump’s virus task forceThe Trump administration plans to disband its coronavirus task force in the coming weeks. Vice President Mike Pence said the decision was a “reflection of the tremendous progress we’ve made as a country” — despite growing evidence that the outbreak is still raging.
The task force was a key part of President Trump’s response: He often shared the stage with its medical experts, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, during televised briefings.
Why it matters: “The influence of those health officials was reassuring to those who believed doctors and scientists should mix with the more economic-minded figures in the group,” said Noah Weiland, who covers health care for The Times. “If the task force dissolves, people like Dr. Fauci may have a less organized role at the White House.”

2. A Covid-linked child illness
The number of children afflicted with a mysterious illness — most likely connected to Covid-19 — is growing. There are now at least 50 reported cases in New York State, and several more across the United States and in Europe.
The symptoms include fever, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea; though none of the children have died, some have needed a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. The condition suggests that, contrary to early hopes, children will not be spared all of the virus’s most serious effects.

3. A case suggests a new virus timelineThe coronavirus appears to have reached Europe in late December, weeks earlier than previously understood. The new evidence came from a sample taken on Dec. 27 — and tested only recently by doctors — from a 42-year-old man near Paris who had not traveled abroad.
If verified, the discovery would mean the virus was spreading beyond China for weeks, unrecognized.
4. Where’s the beef?The chart below makes clear why the United States has a meat shortage (including at the more than 1,000 Wendy’s franchises that were sold out of burgers this week).
Among the 10 metropolitan areas with the most new confirmed virus cases per capita, half are home to a meat processing plant where workers evidently have the virus. The tight working conditions at the plants seem to be a key reason.

5. A McConnell protégé goes before the Senate
A Senate committee will hold a confirmation hearing today for 37-year-old Justin Walker, the youngest nominee to the federal appellate court in Washington since 1983. Walker is a protégé of Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who called the Senate back to Washington this week in part for today’s hearing.
Walker’s likely confirmation is part of McConnell’s ambitious strategy for remaking the federal courts. He refused to confirm many nominees in President Barack Obama’s second term and has since helped Trump appoint more than one-quarter of all appellate judges.

BACK STORY: How to clean right Tara Parker-Pope gets some of her best ideas for Well, The Times’s consumer health site, from reader questions. So we’re going to start a regular feature in this newsletter where Tara answers a question that readers submit.
Today’s is about how to clean surfaces effectively — ideally to kill any trace of coronavirus or other germs.
Many cleaning products recommend leaving the disinfectant on a surface for a long time — like four minutes or even 10 minutes — before wiping it off. Several readers asked, in essence: Really?
The short answer: You probably don’t need to take those times literally. They tend to come from laboratory tests involving more germs than exist in most homes. And yet many of us probably are cleaning surfaces too quickly.
“Reporting this story has made me realize how I’ve been cleaning all wrong and too fast,” Tara says. “I always just spray and wipe — I never let it sit!”
Fortunately, the new coronavirus is fairly easy to kill. Even a little extra cleaning time — one expert suggests about a minute — can do the job. For more, read the full story.

818,284,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19,2020-04-10,Warehouse workers are forcing Amazon to take COVID-19 seriously,"Early Tuesday, March 24th, Barbara Chandler drove from her home in Queens to the Staten Island Amazon warehouse where she’d worked for three years. The streets were emptier than usual. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had ordered all nonessential businesses to close two days before, and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state had just passed 20,000. But the warehouse, called JFK8, was busier than ever, deluged with orders from a locked-down populace.

Chandler’s co-workers at JFK8 had been getting sick for weeks but none, as far as she knew, with COVID-19. Still, it was unnerving. The day before, she sent home one of her team members after they vomited at their station, visited the in-house medical facility, Amcare, and attempted to continue working. A week earlier, she sent several sick co-workers to Amcare, including one who said her fiancé had COVID-19 and whom Chandler never saw again.

Chandler, 40, had begun to feel unwell over the weekend, but she’d checked her temperature and wasn’t feverish. Just in case, she’d gone to get a coronavirus test after work the day before. She felt she needed to keep working as she waited for the result. Amazon would give her two weeks of paid leave if she tested positive for COVID-19. But if she was sick with something else, she’d have to take time off without pay. She had three children to support, and she was already starting to feel better.

Key findings Workers at JFK8 raised alarms about sick co-workers in the weeks before COVID-19 cases were confirmed.

At least 14 workers have tested positive for COVID-19 at JFK8, and workers say the number is far higher.

Though Amazon says it fired a protest organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never quarantined or notified. The organizer says his quarantine and firing were retaliatory.

Following a string of protests, Amazon began providing protective equipment, piloting disinfectant fogging, and implementing other safety measures.

Workers fear such precautions come too late and want the facility to be closed for cleaning.

A week later, JFK8 would become the first of several Amazon facilities to have workers walk out in protest, calling for the warehouse to be closed and cleaned after workers tested positive for COVID-19. Amazon’s subsequent firing of the organizer intensified the national spotlight and elicited condemnation from unions, promises of a state investigation, and letters from lawmakers. As the largest Amazon facility in the most severe COVID-19 hotspot in the US, the clash at JFK8 serves as a preview of tensions rising throughout Amazon’s fulfillment network. On one side, there’s a company that sees itself as providing a vital service to millions of homebound Americans and is determined to maintain operations amid the crisis. On the other, there are workers who feel increasingly unsafe at their jobs and, as Amazon struggles to staff its warehouses to meet unprecedented demand, newly empowered to push for changes.

Amazon has already made a number of policy changes in response to the pandemic, many of them long-desired by workers. In mid-March, it announced that employees could take unlimited time off without pay (previously, they would be fired for more than taking a certain amount), and they would receive up to two weeks of paid leave if they tested positive for COVID-19 or were placed in quarantine. Later, the company raised pay by $2 per hour, doubled overtime pay, and gave part-time workers paid time off. As the virus spread, Amazon moved warehouse break room tables apart, staggered shifts, canceled stand-up meetings, and made other adjustments to enable greater distance between workers.

At least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed

But interviews with 12 JFK8 employees, as well as workers at other warehouses, show the implementation of safety precautions has been uneven. Often, changes are made only after workers exert pressure. Following criticism, Amazon has begun alerting workers when someone at their facility tests positive for COVID-19, but documents obtained by The Verge show notifications still lag by days. While Amazon is giving workers placed in quarantine two weeks of paid leave, some workers who came into contact with diagnosed individuals aren’t being notified. Though Amazon says it fired the JFK8 organizer for violating quarantine, other workers with greater exposure were never contacted.

After the JFK8 walkout, Amazon began checking temperatures at the warehouse entrance, enforcing social distancing rules, and piloting fog disinfectant. But workers had been sounding alarms for weeks, and they now fear it’s too late to prevent a major outbreak.

Amazon declined to say how many workers at how many facilities had tested positive for COVID-19, but Jana Jumpp, a worker in an Indiana warehouse, has been collecting alerts sent to workers and counted 314 workers at 111 facilities who have been diagnosed with the virus. JFK8 appears to be a hotspot. At least 14 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, according to alerts viewed by The Verge. Workers believe the true number is closer to 30.

March 24th would prove to be a turning point at JFK8. Chandler began work as usual, but two hours into her shift, another assistant manager, Christian Smalls, came over and told her she looked sick — exhausted, with bloodshot eyes — and said she should go home. Other colleagues had noticed her appearance as well, but they attributed it to overwork. Smalls, however, had been anxious about the spreading virus for weeks and was on high alert.

Smalls, 31 years old and father of three, had worked at JFK8 since it opened in 2018 and Amazon warehouses in New Jersey and Connecticut before that. It’s a good job, he says, with good benefits, and he hadn’t had any complaints. But in early March, he became concerned about what would happen when the virus reached the warehouse with its 5,000 employees. After some managers flew back from Seattle, at the time the largest hotspot in the US, and one took sick leave, Smalls was alarmed enough to stay away, using his vacation time and eventually tapping his 401k. But now he’d returned, and he’d been pushing management to close the building for cleaning and institute other safety measures. The week before, Smalls and other workers worried about the rising cases of illness at the facility repeatedly went to the manager’s office and said the building should be shut down and cleaned.

“It’s almost like the pandemic didn’t exist inside the warehouse.”

Instead, Amazon made incremental changes and encouraged workers to maintain social distancing, even if their jobs often made that impossible. (A video of the break room from March 19th shows a crowded cafeteria with workers eating and walking within three feet of each other.) “They would say, ‘we don’t have any confirmed cases, we’re following the CDC guidelines,’” Smalls says. “They kept giving me that excuse, and I said, ‘yeah, but people are getting sick around me.’”

“People were just looking sick, and on top of that, we’re hearing about the pandemic on TV, it’s almost like the pandemic didn’t exist inside the warehouse,” says Derrick Palmer, a co-worker who also expressed concerns to management. “There was no social distancing going on, there was nothing.”

After Smalls sent Chandler home, he attended a supervisors’ meeting where he learned that a worker had tested positive for the virus, someone who’d last been in the building on March 11th. Again, he called for the building to be shut down, and again, he was met with resistance. More alarming for Smalls, managers refused to notify all JFK8 workers that someone had tested positive, opting instead to walk the floor and inform select people. The result was that most workers learned of the case when someone posted the news to Facebook later that day or when Vice reported the infection that night. Frustrated, Smalls left the building and went home.

“I couldn’t just sit at home and watch people get sick.”

“That was the last time Amazon got my services,” Smalls says. “After that, I came back to the building every single day at seven o’clock in the morning to raise concerns, and I sat in that building for eight hours a day, trying to spread the word, to tell the truth to the people. Since management wanted to keep it a secret, I felt like it was my obligation. I couldn’t just sit at home and watch people get sick.”

The next morning, Smalls returned to JFK8 and went straight to the break room without clocking in. New York had confirmed more than 30,000 coronavirus cases that morning, but in the facility, little had changed. (A video taken the next day, on March 26th, shows the tables had been separated and lines taped on the floor, but workers were still in close proximity.) On the warehouse floor, Smalls and other workers say, employees often worked shoulder to shoulder and shared equipment. For several hours, Smalls told co-workers about the COVID-19 case and gathered a group to visit the general manager’s office, interrupting the morning meeting.

Video of the visit shows a tense exchange, with workers and managers shouting over each other.

“You can pass it on to your grandmother, to your kids, what’s the point? For some money?” one worker said. Another demanded to know how many cases there’d been at the facility. “Time is of the essence right now,” one more worker added.

“We don’t make that decision at the site level whether we close or not,” a manager said. “We are also following the directions of the CDC. We’re done with this conversation.”

For the rest of the week, Smalls and other workers went back to the manager’s office each morning, and despite the fraught exchange Wednesday, he says JFK8 leadership was generally supportive, telling him when would be a good time for workers to come to express their concerns and thanking him for keeping people calm. But in each instance, leadership would promise to take their concerns up the chain to regional management, and nothing would happen.

“HR just told me that I should keep it quiet.”

Meanwhile, Chandler was at home awaiting her test results. On Thursday morning, she called the urgent care facility and got them: she had the virus. She texted her diagnosis to three supervisors who asked her how she was feeling and said they would escalate her case to human resources and global security. Later, Chandler got a call from HR. “HR just told me that I should keep it quiet,” Chandler says. “That’s all they told me.”

Four days would pass before workers received an alert about the second case at JFK8, but another worker heard about Chandler’s diagnosis and posted it on Facebook. Besieged with questions, Chandler posted the news herself and texted Smalls, who took the news to the manager’s office and said the dozens of workers Chandler had come in contact with should be quarantined. “They were like, ‘Oh no, we will notify you through the phone or through email,’” Smalls recalls.

Two days later, on Saturday, Smalls was sitting in the break room talking to workers about the virus when a senior manager took him aside and told him that last Tuesday, he had been in contact with someone who tested positive. They said Smalls should be quarantined and must leave the building, according to Smalls and two other workers present.

An Amazon spokesperson says that the company does not tell workers who they came in contact with out of respect for worker privacy and that it was first made aware that the employee Smalls had contact with tested positive on March 27th. The spokesperson said Amazon began notifying workers immediately and told Smalls verbally on the 28th that he should leave the building and go into quarantine. But because the supervisor told Smalls he had been exposed on Tuesday, the 24th — when Chandler, the second known case at the facility, was last in the building — Smalls, Chandler, and other workers surmised that the exposure in question was the moment Smalls sent Chandler home.

Chandler and Smalls both say this exchange was brief, about five minutes, and from six feet away. Chandler says she had closer contact with approximately 40 people that day and the preceding day. Yet as far as she knows, none have been quarantined. Palmer, who worked with Chandler, was not put in quarantine and doesn’t know anyone on their team who was. “You’re going to tell me that none of these 40 associates had contact with her? That’s impossible,” he says. (Amazon declined to say how many other workers were placed in quarantine in addition to Smalls.)

“Chris only got quarantined because he started barking.”

One worker who was in close contact with Chandler for prolonged periods on the 24th was never placed in quarantine. The worker, who asked to remain anonymous, didn’t learn Chandler had tested positive until the Friday after Chandler got her results when she checked Facebook. Upon seeing Chandler’s post, she contacted her supervisor asking whether she should quarantine and was told HR would be calling people shortly, according to screenshots viewed by The Verge. She never received a call. On Saturday, she messaged her supervisor again and was told someone would talk to workers during her shift the next day. But on Sunday, when the worker returned to JFK8, the supervisor on duty seemed not to know about the incident and later told her that the safety team had analyzed video and quarantined anyone who had had close contact with Chandler for more than 15 minutes.

“Chris only got quarantined because he started barking,” the worker said. “I had more contact with Barbara, Chris had about five minutes with her, I had almost a whole morning. And they told me absolutely nothing until I spoke to [a supervisor] and said, ‘are we going to mention this? What’s going on?’”

“It was retaliation,” Smalls says. “It was an attempt to silence me.”

After being ejected from the building, Smalls decided to organize the walkout. He contacted other workers he’d spoken to in the break room and formed an Instagram group chat. They posted on Facebook and printed out flyers, which workers left in restrooms at JFK8 the next day. “We had 24 hours to do it,” Smalls says. “I ran to CVS. I spent $100 on signs and posters. I was on go. I didn’t sleep that night.”

“It was an attempt to silence me.”

On Monday morning, workers at JFK8 received a text alert: a new COVID-19 case at the facility had been confirmed, last in the building on March 24th. This, Chandler says, was her. Four days had elapsed since she told supervisors she tested positive.

Around noon, workers walked out. Organizers say 60 employees protested, while Amazon put the number at 15. Many wore homemade masks or bandanas over their faces and carried signs calling for the building to be shut down and cleaned. Smalls returned to the facility for the first time since his expulsion and stood with protesters in the parking lot, addressing reporters.

When he got home, Smalls received a call from the same supervisor who placed him in quarantine, saying he had violated the directive by returning to JFK8 and was fired. In a statement, Amazon later said it did not fire Smalls for organizing the protest, but for “putting the health and safety of others at risk” by coming back to the facility after being placed in quarantine.

The firing brought Smalls a far larger audience than the walkout ever would have. Unions and elected officials issued statements calling for his reinstatement. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the city’s Commission on Human Rights to investigate his firing. Smalls gave interview after interview and appeared on MSNBC the next night. Minutes after the segment ended, JFK8 workers received an alert: three new cases at the facility.

Throughout the furor, Amazon struck a righteous tone, claiming that Smalls was the real threat to worker safety, and his firing shows how seriously the company is taking the virus. “I’m confused. Thought you wanted us to protect our workers?” Amazon public relations head Jay Carney tweeted at Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday. “Mr. Smalls purposely violated social distancing rules, repeatedly, & was put on Paid 14-day quarantine for COVID exposure. 3/30 he returned to the site. Knowingly putting our team at risk is unacceptable.”

“We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral.”

This turned out to be a strategy developed at the highest levels of the company. Vice later obtained notes from a meeting attended by Jeff Bezos in which Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky called Smalls “not smart or articulate” and discussed plans to make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.” (Workers began a unionization effort at JFK8 shortly after it opened, though Smalls says he was not involved.) “We should spend the first part of our response strongly laying out the case for why the organizer’s conduct was immoral, unacceptable, and arguably illegal, in detail, and only then follow with our usual talking points about worker safety,” Zapolsky wrote.

After the memo leaked, Smalls gave yet another round of interviews. “They’ve been trying to silence me from the beginning,” Smalls says. “All I was doing was trying to help people in my building, but somehow my life changed in 24 hours, so I’m still trying to cope with this.” He’s been barraged with messages from Amazon workers around the world. “I got the weight of the world on my shoulders as far as the retail industry goes. I’ve got every person at Amazon from all over the world calling and texting me. They’re supportive, and it makes me feel good to know that I’m giving them a voice, but at the same time we need to take action. Everybody’s reaching out to me, I’m like, yeah, you know what you do, you walk the hell out of your buildings.”

But Smalls’ firing also had a dampening effect on worker activism. Multiple workers at JFK8 and other Amazon facilities say they share his concerns and would support a walkout, but that after his firing, they are afraid to risk their jobs. Worried about their health but reluctant to protest, they decided to stay home without pay and hope the pandemic receded soon. When workers at JFK8 walked out a second time this Monday, only 10 or so protested. Others posted messages of support online from the safety of their homes.

Since the first walkout, workers at JFK8 have received near daily alerts about new coronavirus cases. The alerts don’t specify a number, saying only that “multiple” or “additional” new cases have been confirmed. Amazon declined to give a total. Assuming each alert represents only two cases, there have been at least 14, and workers estimate there to be twice as many.

Amazon has been publicly dismissive of worker actions at JFK8 and elsewhere, calling their claims “simply unfounded” and saying it has taken “extreme measures” to ensure employee safety. But in the aftermath of the protests, the company has instituted new safety precautions at a rapid clip. Days after the walkout at JFK8 and similar protests in Chicago and Detroit, Amazon announced it would install temperature readers at its warehouses and anyone with a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit would be sent home. Workers greeted it as a positive step, though it wouldn’t have caught someone like Chandler who never ran a fever. After criticism for sending feverish but undiagnosed workers home without pay, Amazon started offering partial pay. At JFK8 and elsewhere, workers now get masks at the beginning of their shift. The company also told workers it would institute “mandatory social distancing,” potentially firing workers who “intentionally violate” the guidelines. (A worker who received a writeup at JFK8 said her job still required being in close proximity and worried she’d be fired for unavoidable violations.) This week, Amazon began piloting “disinfectant fogging” at JFK8 and announced plans to begin producing its own diagnostic tests for workers.

“The only reason they’re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.”

In a statement, Amazon said it has been implementing new safety measures over the past several weeks and will continue to do so. “The health and safety of our employees is our top priority,” an Amazon spokesperson said. “Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and local health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates and teams.”

“Were they slow? Yeah, definitely,” says Palmer. “The only reason they’re doing this stuff is because we blasted them in the media.”

But workers fear the measures arrived too late to avert a major outbreak, and five of the 12 workers The Verge spoke with had decided to stay home without pay, either out of fear of infecting vulnerable family members or concerns for their own safety. “I need the paycheck, I have bills to pay,” said one worker. But she has asthma and lives with her grandmother, and one day in the break room became overwhelmed with anxiety and never came back. Another worker grew alarmed by the repeated alerts about new cases and stopped coming in. “I can’t afford not to be there, but by the same token, I can’t afford to get the virus,” she said.

She’s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave

Chandler is still recovering and has developed a cough. She hopes she can return to work soon. She’s exhausted her two weeks of coronavirus leave and is now getting only 60 percent of her pay. (Amazon says employees who exhaust their COVID-19 sick leave are eligible for short-term disability, which pays 60 percent of their salary.)

She believes she got the virus at the warehouse. She only goes outside to drive to work and back, and she’s in such frequent contact with her co-workers. Chandler wishes Amazon had acted sooner and thinks it’s now too late to safely operate the warehouse without shutting it down and testing everyone before reopening. “They should have notified everyone with the first case,” she says. “And they should have closed the building for deep cleaning.”",real

Associated Press

Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.

The first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy problems and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.

Contact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.

Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked

More:Apple, Google will warn you if you've been exposed to COVID-19. Here's how.

Other tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.

Privacy concerns over tracking

Privacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.

Even the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. ""The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.

ACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. ""Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,"" Singh Guliani said.

She urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.

Utah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.

The state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.

""This is a red state,"" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. ""They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.' ""

Wolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.

North Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. ""It was rushed to market,"" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. ""We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.""

Tracking without revealing identity

The ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.

But even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.

Among the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.

Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Salathé said all COVID-19 apps so far are ""fundamentally broken"" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salathé authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.

""You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,"" he said.

Other U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.

Salesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace ""relationships across people, places and events"" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.

""It's only as good as a lot of us using it,"" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. ""If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective."" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.

The ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation.",real
826,163,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195551/tesla-fremont-factory-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-shutdown-shelter-place,2020-03-26,Some Tesla factory employees still had to work after the production shutdown,"Local officials have confirmed that Tesla stopped making electric cars in California on Monday, March 23rd, in compliance with a shelter-in-place order brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic. But dozens of workers had to report to the company’s automotive factory to finish processing the final batches of cars this week, according to an email to some of those workers obtained by The Verge and the account of one of the factory’s employees.

This comes as Tesla confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 among its office workforce on Thursday, according to another email that was viewed by The Verge after it was first reported by Business Insider and Electrek. Tesla is also making its first workforce cuts during the pandemic, temporarily laying off some employees in Norway, an electric vehicle stronghold.

The email to factory employees, sent ahead of the production shutdown, informed some of these “end of line” workers that they’d have to keep reporting to the automotive plant to run quality checks, make fixes, and charge and prep the cars for delivery. Tesla management, they were told, essentially wanted all departments that work on a car after it comes off the production line to keep reporting to the factory until the cars were out for delivery. The current employee, who was granted anonymity because they feared retribution, confirmed many of these workers reported to the factory throughout this week.

The local police department says Tesla is complying with the shelter-in-place order

A spokesperson for the local police department told The Verge that it “conducted a visit and inspected Tesla [on Wednesday] and found their current level of operation to be in compliance” with the shelter-in-place order. “Their vehicle assembly line has stopped and they have only a small number of employees in the factory. They have also gone to great lengths to implement social distancing measures,” they said.

Factory workers were also told in the email that they wouldn’t receive the paid leave Tesla has promised until their own departments finally shut down. Any workers who did not feel well or felt uncomfortable coming to work were encouraged to use accrued paid time off or take unpaid leave, which was the company’s guidance before the shutdown was announced last week.

The current factory worker said Tesla’s end of line process usually takes a few hours for a car with “moderate issues.” But they also said the company finished production on Monday with an increased number of cars considered to be “work in progress,” which, therefore, required more end of line work.

Cars coming off the production lines of legacy automakers usually complete end of line checks in a matter of minutes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst at Navigant Research. Tesla did not respond to questions about the end of line workers or the employees who tested positive for COVID-19.

Tesla had kept the Fremont, California factory open last week, even after the shelter-in-place order took effect in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 17th. The company had just started delivering the Model Y, its fifth electric car, and was in the middle of a typical end-of-quarter push to make and deliver as many cars as possible.

Tesla had just started delivering the Model Y as the pandemic gripped the US

At the same time that CEO Elon Musk was underplaying the threat of the coronavirus, almost every other major automaker suspended production operations in the United States following a deal between Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and the United Auto Workers union. Tesla, which is the biggest automaker in the US without a unionized workforce, did tell some of its white-collar workers to work remotely if possible last week while the factory remained open.

The company ultimately announced on March 19th that it would comply with the Bay Area order and shut down operations at the California factory where the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and now the Model Y are assembled, and it agreed to reduce the workforce there to “basic operations” like processing payroll. Tesla announced that same day that it would also pause operations at its solar panel factory in New York, but that the Gigafactory in Nevada would keep operating, despite the governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

It’s currently unclear which office the two infected Tesla employees work in. Laurie Shelby, who runs Tesla’s environmental, health, and safety division, said in the email that the two employees “had been working from home for nearly two weeks” before they tested positive for COVID-19. Shelby said the employees did not show symptoms of the disease while they were in the office and that their “direct coworkers, who were already working from home for nearly two weeks as well, were immediately notified so they can quarantine and watch for symptoms.” Both employees are “quarantined at home and recovering well,” Shelby wrote.

Tesla briefly shut down its newest factory in China earlier this year as part of a government-mandated effort to suppress the spread of the virus. But Musk tweeted on Wednesday that he plans to reopen the New York factory “as soon as humanly possible” as Tesla joins in the effort to help increase the production of ventilators, which are crucial to treating the worst symptoms of COVID-19.",real

KAMPALA, Uganda -- Burundi is pushing ahead with an election on Wednesday that will end the president's divisive and bloody 15-year rule.

When President Pierre Nkurunziza hands over power, it could be the first truly peaceful transfer of authority in the East African nation since independence in 1962.

But the coronavirus poses a threat to the May 20 vote. Burundi has kicked out World Health Organization workers after concerns were raised. The WHO Africa director messaged the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief about political rallies the day that Burundi's campaigning launched and images of crowds circulated online.

Authorities have been accused by critics of downplaying the pandemic and citing divine protection. But the government appears to be using virus measures to limit election observers, warning the East African regional bloc on May 8 that arriving foreigners face a 14-day quarantine.

More than the virus, however, it's the fear of violence that weighs on many of the more than 5 million people eligible to vote.

Government agents have been accused of harassing the main opposition party, the CNL, whose leader Agathon Rwasa is believed to be in a close race with Nkurunziza's chosen successor in the ruling CNDD-FDD, Evariste Ndayishimiye.

More than 145 CNL members have been arrested since campaigning began on April 27, according to SOS Medias Burundi, a group of independent journalists. Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye has accused Rwasa of making “incendiary and defamatory” remarks and inciting revolt.

Rwasa, the deputy parliament speaker, has drawn large crowds despite the risks of openly supporting him, according to an online group of activists known as i-Burundi.

The group worries that a rigged election could spark the kind of street demonstrations that marked the previous vote in 2015.

“The ruling party was hoping to use this post-Nkurunziza election to gain a semblance of legitimacy, but given what’s happening we might end up with more violence,” i-Burundi said in an interview. “People want change. ... But the ruling party has the incumbent advantage and controls the electoral process.”

Rwasa told The Associated Press he feels it's important not to boycott the election even if the outcome is not expected to be fair.

“Everything has its right time,"" he said. “Right now, it is not the time to give up and abandon our people.""

Ndayishimiye, a retired general, would be a weak president because he will be a front for Nkurunziza and other powerful ruling party members, said David Gakunzi, a Burundian political analyst: “He consults but he will fear to take independent decisions.”

Ndayishimiye fought alongside Nkurunziza as a rebel in the civil war from 1993 to 2005 that killed about 300,000 people. Nkurunziza was chosen by lawmakers to be president during the peace process known as the Arusha Accords, which specified that a president's term can be renewed only once.

But Nkurunziza, who won a second term in 2010, said he was eligible for a third term in 2015 because he had not been chosen the first time by universal suffrage.

The deadly turmoil that followed badly damaged ties with the international community, and Burundi became the first country to leave the International Criminal Court after it started investigating allegations of abuses. The U.N. human rights office reported more than 300 extrajudicial killings and was kicked out of the country.

Nkurunziza survived a coup attempt shortly after the 2015 vote while traveling in Tanzania and has left Burundi only once since then. Meanwhile international donors have cut support, leaving the government struggling. It has ordered citizens to pay for the upcoming vote.

Many Burundians were surprised when the president announced in 2018 that he was serving his last term. Skepticism persists. The government has approved legislation that bestows upon Nkurunziza the title of “paramount leader” after he steps down.

“It’s hard to know what’s going to happen ... Nkurunziza has a track record of being quite unpredictable,"" said researcher Lane Hartill of the Burundi Human Rights Initiative. ""Both the ruling party and the main opposition party, the CNL, are convinced their candidates are going to win the presidential election. It’s telling, though, that government officials continue to arrest large numbers of CNL members.”

Even some senior members of the ruling party are tired of rights violations and the cratering economy but are afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs or being killed, Hartill said.

Burundi's government has denied allegations it targets its people, calling them malicious propaganda by dissidents.

Memories of the 2015 violence are still raw. Jean Baptiste Bakunzi said he remains traumatized by his brother's death at the hands of the police and the Imbonerakure, a militarized youth group associated with the ruling party. His brother, accused of participating in anti-government activities, “knelt down and begged them to save his life,"" Bakunzi said.

""Instead, one policeman pulled the trigger and shot him dead,” he said. “Whoever opposes the ruling party becomes an enemy even today.”

The violence has dimmed hopes for those outside Burundi who will not be able to vote. Over 330,000 refugees are sheltering in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Congo, according to U.N. figures.

“These elections will not bring hope for us because we have lost so much,"" said Solange Teta, a refugee in Rwanda. “The ruling party candidate cannot alleviate our suffering.""

Sporadic violence persists. Police said two people were killed and eight wounded in a grenade attack Sunday on a bar in Bujumbura that's a popular hangout for ruling party supporters. Opposition supporters worry the security services may retaliate.

Charles Nditije, a former government minister who lives in exile, described the election as a “joke,” calling the polls a formality aimed at installing Nkurunziza's chosen successor.

“What Burundians want now is anything that can bring to (an) end the reign of CNDD-FDD. But the ruling (party) candidate will fight tooth and nail to win fraudulently and set another round of crisis,” he said.

Hartill, the Burundi researcher, said disputed election results could put the country back on edge. The big question, he said, is whether the opposition leader will “say enough is enough.”

""We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,"" The Nailspot said in a May 13 Facebook post. ""If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.""

Oklahoma allowed nail salons and other ""personal contact"" businesses to reopen on April 24.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The Nailspot opened its doors for the first time in weeks on May 5. Just over a week later, the beauty parlor in northeast Oklahoma is closing them again after an employee was infected with the coronavirus.

""We have received a positive COVID-19 test from a staff member who was in the salon on May 5-7,"" the Bartlesville shop announced in a May 13 post on Facebook. ""If you were in the salon on these days you could have been potentially exposed.""

It's not clear where the employee contracted the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19.

""Washington County Health Department recommends that any customer that was in the salon during this time self-isolate for 14 days and if symptoms arise to contact Washington County Health Dept for further information and instruction,"" the salon wrote in its Facebook post. Nailspot plans to reopen on May 26.

Oklahoma was one of the first states to begin reopening its economy during the pandemic, with Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, allowing salons, spas, and pet groomers to resume service on April 24.

Restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters followed suit on May 1.

In California, by contrast, authorities have refused to allow nail salons, in particular, to reopen.

""This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed in a May 7 address. ""I just want to remind everybody of that and that I'm very worried about that,"" he added, though — to the consternation of salon owners — he did not provide supporting evidence.

Oklahoma's guidelines on reopening call for increased handwashing at such ""personal contact"" establishments, noting that ""[r]emaining six feet apart as in other businesses is not possible.""

The guidelines do not call for either employees or customers to wear masks, suggesting only that employees consider wearing them ""if the customer requests.""

In a May 3 post announcing its plans to reopen, the salon suggested that clients bring their own masks. ""If you do not have one, we will try to provide you with one,"" it said.

At least 284 people have died from COVID-19 in Oklahoma, according to the state government. Six new deaths were announced May 14, down from nine fatalities announced May 5, when The Nailspot reopened — the same number of deaths announced April 24, when salons were legally permitted to resume business.",real

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teachers, students and families to make quick adjustments into new daily roles and routines.

Some families may be undergoing such profound stress that students cannot do any schoolwork at all. For other students, schoolwork may provide some stability and a sense of purpose for their future.

The good news is that even when faced with major disruptions in learning, children are resilient and tend to catch up in skill development to where they would have been, as long as they enter a supportive environment after the disruption. Students who have a smaller gain in learning in one year tend to have a larger gain in the following year.

Opinion

As the district, teachers, and families figure out the strategies that work best for them, there are lessons from research conducted under normal conditions that may be helpful in this unique situation.

Countering the limitations of online Instruction

Research indicates that most students learn better when instruction is in person, rather than online, and students with the lowest achievement seem to benefit least from online classes. Even if online instruction isn’t as effective as face-to-face instruction, it is still effective for most students, and better than no instruction.

One reason students sometimes struggle with online learning is because of a lack of flexibility in what is taught. While online classes are usually self-paced, course content can feel rigid. In a study comparing online to face-to-face algebra credit recovery classes, researchers found that face-to-face teachers adjusted the content of their instruction considerably more than online teachers, even though the online teachers had the technology to be able to offer mini-tutorials and respond directly to students’ questions.

It was easier for the in-person teachers to recognize when students needed help and adapt their instruction accordingly. In fact, when students taking the algebra course online had access to a supportive math teacher in their computer lab, they ended up with similar pass rates as students enrolled in face-to-face versions of the same class.

All of this suggests that online learning places more demands on teachers around intentional communication with students and their caregivers.

Communication among teachers, students, and families is even more critical now

Another downside of online instruction is that it makes two-way communication more cumbersome. Teachers can’t anticipate how all their individual students will respond to instructional tasks, and the feedback they ordinarily get in the classroom as they watch and listen to students engage with the material is vital information for doing their jobs well.

Students feel supported when they believe their teacher knows how they are doing in the class and gives them the support they need to succeed. Without having students in front of them, teachers may not know when they are assigning work that is taking longer than it should to complete and when students feel stuck or overwhelmed. They also will have difficulty recognizing when students are under-challenged or disinterested.

It can be easier for people at home to see whether students need more support, whether work is taking too long, or if students feel under-challenged. To support learning at home, teachers and families need to be in regular communication, whether they have the technology for face-to-face online chats, or are reaching out by phone, group chats, texting, etc.

Even when assignments are not being used for grades, teachers can monitor assignment completion as a signal for who might need help, modifications, resources, or a more personal connection.

Learning is more than test scores — it’s also social and emotional

Brain science has shown that learning has both social and emotional components—people are not computers who can input information and retain it without making an emotional connection and seeing how it fits with their other experiences.

Teachers and caregivers who are supporting learning at home need to talk to students about how they are experiencing the work. Do students believe they can succeed at the task? Do they feel the work is relevant? Do they feel they will learn and grow from the experience?

Students’ confidence that they can succeed at their school assignments, and that the work has value, provides a sense of security and motivation.

What happens in the long-term will matter most

There is no clear roadmap for teachers, parents, and guardians right now. Nobody is going to be perfect in how they are able to support students, even as they all work very hard to do so. The crisis is causing acute immediate stress — from sharing confined space and home technology, to worry about severe financial and health effects on ourselves and others.

There will also be long-term stress from the financial fallout of the crisis and the loss of loved ones. Families will not have all the financial and emotional supports that they did previously, and inequities in education will become more extreme.

Supporting all students ultimately means making preparation so that students have a safe, stable school environment that is responsive to the social-emotional needs of every child when they go back to the classroom.

Moody's Analytics studied which cities are in the best position to recover from the outbreak.

Their looked at places which are less densely populated and have a large number of jobs that require a college or graduate degree.

Business Insider ranked the 20 cities that had the highest share of jobs that require at least a college degree among big metro areas with 600 or fewer people per square mile, using figures from Moody's Analytics.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Low-population-density cities with high educational attainment could bounce back first from the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to a study from Moody's Analytics.

Adam Kamins, senior regional economist at Moody's Analytics, analyzed which of the 100 largest US metro areas are likely to see the quickest economic recoveries after the outbreak subsides. His analysis shows that places that are less densely populated but also have a large share of jobs that require at least a college degree are likely to bounce back first, while more densely populated cities that have taken an economic hit from the coronavirus will likely take longer to recover.

Moody's Analytics used occupation data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to identify jobs where the minimum requirement is a college degree.

Kamins notes in his analysis that some of the places from his analysis were college towns, such as Durham, North Carolina, home of Duke University, and they could have a higher degree of educational attainment for that reason.

""Still, it makes sense that dynamic economies built around a major university...could enjoy a surge in growth in the years to come,"" Moody's Analytics told Business Insider.

The results also suggest metro areas in the Midwest and Southern region of the US that have jobs requiring high educational attainment and fewer people per square mile are likely to bounce back first.

Using data from Moody's Analytics, we ranked the 20 metro areas that have the largest share of jobs that require a college or graduate degree among cities that have 600 or fewer people per square mile.

Durham, North Carolina, was at the top of the list with, 40.37% of jobs requiring at least a college degree and a population density per square mile around 332. Moody's Analytics said Denver, which ranked No. 2 on our list, and Salt Lake City, which ranked No. 8 on our list are ""well positioned to retake their crown as two of the fastest-rising metro areas in the US.""

In about 15 seconds, it calculates how much oxygen is being transported through the person’s bloodstream and displays the results as a percentage (abbreviated SpO₂). Doctors consider a SpO₂ reading of 94 percent and higher to be normal. Low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) can lead to low levels of oxygen in the tissue and organs (hypoxia), which can lead to death.

Pulse oximeters are usually purchased for home use by people who want or need to monitor their oxygen supply, including patients with chronic lung conditions such as COPD, performance athletes or people living at high altitude. Shortly after the pandemic began, however, the easy-to-use devices started being touted as a means to detect serious complications from covid-19, the disease the virus causes.





“The reason there is such great interest pulse oximeters now is that covid-19 has a fairly significant effect on the body’s ability to oxygenate, sometimes discordant with how the patient feels,” says Benjamin Seides, director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Ill., outside Chicago. Though patients aren’t especially short of breath, their low blood oxygen levels may indicate they are headed for a crisis.

Seides said an idea started to spread: Maybe if physicians told people to watch their blood oxygen levels, they could contact a doctor or go to the emergency room if their saturation levels dramatically dipped. That prompted a run on the devices.

Sales data provided to The Washington Post from Bloomreach, an e-commerce software firm, shows that U.S. sales of fingertip pulse oximeters increased by 506 percent over the previous week during the week of Feb. 17 and 168 percent over that week during the week of Feb. 24. Since that time, demand held fairly steady and then tapered off the first two weeks of April. But in recent weeks, sales again have started to climb, perhaps as consumers prepare for the next phase of living with the pandemic. In mid-May, the devices were still sold out, delayed or on back order in stores such as Walgreens, CVS and Target.





Medical-grade pulse oximeters cost $200 or more, but consumers can find them for about $50 at pharmacies, big-box stores and online. Even the lower-cost versions are considered a fast and reliable way to measure how well you are oxygenating.

Correct usage is key to a trustworthy reading, however, which can fluctuate based on a number of factors — what you are doing physically (sitting versus running), proper device placement and the altitude you live at. Artificial nails and nail polish, especially gel-based, can produce inaccurate measurements of SpO₂, as they block the light transmission. Cold hands or poor circulation can also interfere with the light and produce false numbers, because pulse oximeters need a steady flow of blood beneath the sensor.

Pulmonologist Federico Cerrone, managing physician at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J., says people with chronic health issues may want to get a pulse oximeter at this time because it can be a helpful tool for regularly checking in with a doctor via telemedicine. Patients with covid-19 who are discharged from a hospital also may be given a pulse oximeter so they can monitor their numbers to see if they are improving or getting worse.





“It can be a reassurance or a harbinger of issues indicating you may need to return to the hospital,” Cerrone says.

Unless you have an underlying condition or are recovering from covid-19, however, you probably don’t need to add one to your collection of home health supplies.

“It’s a convenience, not a necessity. If you are short of breath or have a cough, you can usually call your physician and have a drive-through check of your oxygenation,” says Cerrone.

He also cautions against the use of oximeter apps that purport to tell you various medical readings because their performance has not been validated in scientific studies. A recent University of Oxford study found no evidence that any smartphone technology is accurate for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In fact, the study states, “oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted.”





There are potential drawbacks to widespread usage of pulse oximeters. Seides says that some patients who possess them become compulsive and check their saturation levels too often. “In the hands of nervous patients, the device creates anxiety and confusion without much probative value, because even with a small dip in readings they call their physician. It’s important to recognize that a pulse oximeter is a single data point of a complete picture.”

Another concern is that those who use a pulse oximeter as a covid-19 litmus test may ignore other troubling signs.

“I worry that though their saturation numbers look okay, people with other symptoms such a shortness of breath or persistent cough won’t seek medical attention,” says Seides.



Physicians agree that during this pandemic, the important actions remain physical distancing, washing hands, wearing a mask, listening to public health officials and, if you’re not feeling well, calling your doctor.",real
851,518,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21241402/infection-count-coronavirus-cases-survellience-flu-hospital-sewage-data,2020-04-30,It’s impossible to count everyone with COVID-19,"Zack Moore, state epidemiologist in North Carolina, can’t say how many people in the state have COVID-19. He knows how many people test positive for the coronavirus each day, and how many people are in the hospitals across the state, and how many people go to the emergency room with an illness that could be COVID-19. None of those numbers alone pins down how many people are infected. But together, they help sketch an outline of the pandemic.

“It’s never about one single data source. Every source of data is helpful, but they all have their own limitations. So it’s about using them together,” he says.

There’s no way for public health experts to actually count every single person who has any illness at a given time, even well-known illnesses like the flu. Instead, they combine different sources of data to make the best-possible estimate of what disease outbreaks look like. The goal is to understand the virus well enough to make those estimates as accurate as possible.

“People think we know how many people had the flu every year, and we don’t,” Moore says. “We have to use these surveillance tools and indirect measures to get a full understanding.”

Public health officials are measuring the COVID-19 pandemic in a handful of ways. The number of positive test results is an important one, says John Brownstein, an infectious disease epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital. “That data is incredibly valuable, because it’s confirmed illnesses,” he says. But it’s an imperfect tool because most communities in the United States don’t have enough tests available to test everyone who feels sick.

Because everyone who’s sick won’t get a test, experts also look to data collected by hospitals on the people who show up to an emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19. Those measurements also have limitations because many people who have these symptoms might just have the flu or another type of respiratory disease. This approach also misses people who may feel sick but don’t feel sick enough to go to the hospital.

Zooming out even further, some researchers (including Brownstein) have developed programs that ask people to report how they’re feeling each day. They hope that the data will help reveal hotspots where people are starting to feel sick but aren’t getting tested for COVID-19 yet. Another big-picture strategy is measuring levels of the coronavirus in sewage to predict how many people in a community are infected. Antibody tests, which can check if someone was exposed to the virus in the past, are also critical tools. They can help find people who never felt sick and so wouldn’t be caught by any of the surveillance methods that screen for symptoms.

Severe lack of #COVID19 testing means we need alternate methods to understand community transmission.

“We’re constantly trying to bring together different pieces of information, and it all provides a different lens on an outbreak,” Brownstein says.

In North Carolina, Moore looks at all of their data sources daily and weekly and focuses on the trends in that data. If the number of people coming to the emergency room with symptoms of COVID-19 is going down, but the hospitalization rate and number of positive test results are still going up, it might just mean that people are avoiding the emergency room — not that fewer people are sick. “It has to be viewed in the bigger context,” he says. “The trends are what we’re focused on, because that’s what helps us in terms of making decisions about control measures.”

Moore says they’re looking closely at the surveillance tools they’re not already using to see what might be a useful addition to their data sets. “We want to understand whether they’re really value added,” he says. “We don’t want to create more noise — surveillance can already be confusing enough.”

Ongoing research on the virus and how it spreads also help experts figure out the best way to interpret the data they’re collecting. Studies that collect blood samples to test for antibodies in segments of the population, for example, will help identify the percentage of people who catch the coronavirus without ever feeling sick. With that data, public health officials will be able to more accurately estimate the number of people who actually have the virus using the information they gather on people who report symptoms. Moore says he uses an iceberg metaphor: “What we can see is the people who come out and seek medical care. The part under the water is the people who don’t, who we need to learn more about.”

With well-known diseases, public health experts can look at the number of confirmed cases and predict how many cases went undetected. “When we see a single case of hepatitis C, I can tell you pretty confidently that there were 14 other people who probably also had it and weren’t identified,” Moore says. “We’re trying to get that level of understanding for COVID-19.”

Brownstein thinks we’re getting closer. “The further this goes on, the more we’ll be able to get a better estimate.”",real

It now won’t arrive until 2021.

Originally due out later this year, the new version of the Bolt EV was detailed last month by Chevy parent company General Motors at its big “EV day” press event. It will feature a sportier look, new seats, adaptive cruise control, and a few other minor changes. GM bumped up the range in this past year’s version of the Bolt, from 238 miles to 259 miles, but no further increase is expected in the refresh. A larger SUV-style version of the Bolt announced last month is still on schedule to be released later this year, according to GM.

The pandemic has already caused the cancellation of some of the world’s biggest car shows and shut down automotive manufacturing plants around the world, including all of the ones in the US. It’s likely to have an impact on the launch of many more new electric vehicles. For now, Ford still says it plans to release the Mustang Mach-E, its first long-range electric vehicle, later this year. Volkswagen is still aiming for an August rollout of the ID 3, its first “electric car for the masses,” in Europe. Startups like Lucid Motors and Rivian are also planning to start shipping their first electric vehicles by the end of this year.

Some electric vehicles that are anticipated to launch this year in China may have a better shot of making their launch dates. The Polestar 2 — the first fully electric vehicle in the Volvo family of car companies — entered production last week. And Nio has also started making the EC6, its third electric SUV.",real

Nkurunziza, Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were all rebel leaders during the 1993-2005 civil war and come from the Hutu majority group. Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa have assured their supporters of victory, setting the stage for street protests in the likely event that Rwasa is not announced the winner.

The ruling party has garnered support through social welfare programs, such as free maternal care, but has also been accused by human rights groups of regularly intimidating people into voting for them and using mass arrests to silence anti-government voices. The country’s economy is practically nonexistent, and more than 90 percent of its people rely on subsistence farming, leaving them susceptible to climate shocks.

“The Burundian people are determined to shape Burundi anew,” said Rwasa in a phone interview. “Our agitation is embarrassing the dictatorial system, which relies on harsh measures as if we were in a state of emergency. Despite this negative attitude and all ill treatments, we hope to get the big victory.”





More than 140 members of Rwasa’s party have been arrested since campaigning began on April 27, according to SOS Médias Burundi, a group of independent journalists.

Most foreign media outlets have been barred from reporting inside Burundi. Last Thursday, the government expelled a team of experts and the country’s World Health Organization representative after he raised concerns about large election rallies.

Regional election observers were also barred from monitoring Wednesday’s election as the government said they would have to abide by 14-day quarantine protocols after entering the country.

Nkurunziza’s government has refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the United Nations’ human rights organization. The Burundian diaspora, which generally aligns with the opposition, will not be able to vote Wednesday because Burundian embassies have decided that doing so would breach social distancing measures.





At a recent rally, Ndayishimiye attempted to assuage public concerns about the coronavirus, which has only been confirmed in 42 people there.

“Do not be afraid. God loves Burundi and if there are people who have tested positive, it is so that God may manifest his power in Burundi,” he told supporters.

Ndayishimiye controls the ruling party’s youth wing, known as the Imbonerakure, who act as a sort of quasi-police force, especially in rural areas. U.N. investigators have repeatedly pointed to the Imbonerakure as the perpetrators of brutal crackdowns, citing instances of summary executions, torture, sexual violence and mass arrests.

After Nkurunziza extended his mandate and ran again for president in 2015, the military and Imbonerakure quashed street protests. Over the next two years, at least 1,200 were killed in violence, which the United Nations says was mostly carried out by the state’s various security forces. Almost all of the 400,000 who were displaced by the violence remain in camps, mostly in Tanzania, where they are unable to vote.





“The human rights situation is catastrophic on two fronts,” said Janvier Bigirimana, a Burundian lawyer and human rights activist living in exile in Belgium. “First, opposition activists continue to experience all kinds of violence with total impunity. Second, the government of Burundi favored the electoral campaign while sacrificing human lives in the face of the covid-19 pandemic.”

Rwasa’s rallies have drawn large crowds despite the specter of a crackdown. As a rebel leader, Rwasa was also accused of numerous human rights abuses, but human rights groups have praised his restraint even as hundreds of his supporters are arrested.

“His members have been pretty good about not retaliating in face of arrests and killings,” said Lane Hartill, an American researcher at the Burundi Human Rights Initiative. “Having said that, the temperature is increasing. Everyone’s really on edge.”





Hartill and Burundian activists expressed some skepticism that Nkurunziza would step down, even if his own chosen successor won the election. Nkurunziza adopted the title of “eternal supreme guide” of his ruling party two years ago.

If Nkurunziza does step down, he is assured a $530,000 parting gift as well as a luxury mansion according to a law passed in his most recent term. The law gave some activists reason to believe that he would step down, and that real change, however incremental, might be afoot.

“We want a project of a hopeful society for a destitute population,” said Anschaire Nikoyagize, president of Ligue Iteka, a Burundian human rights organization, from exile in Uganda. “The constant courage and commitment of a population subjected to bloody repression and all the hate speech emanating from the Burundian authorities will lead to a popular revolution if it’s not heard.”

A panel of experts convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommends against doctors using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 patients because of potential toxicities.

""The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with QTc prolongation in patients with COVID-19,"" the panel said.

QTc prolongation increases the risk of sudden cardiac death.

The recommendation against their combined use would seem to fly in the face of comments made by President Trump suggesting the combination might be helpful. On March 21, for example, the president described them in a tweet as having a ""real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.""

He has repeatedly touted the use of the drugs during televised coronavirus task force briefings.

""I think it's not a bad idea to do it, but that's up to the doctors,"" Trump said March 31 before adding the caveat, ""It's going to have to be proven. It's very early.""

On April 5, though, without any more evidence of efficacy, he went further:

""What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you're a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good. But what do you have to lose? They say, 'Take it.' I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that's hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.""

As for using the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alone, the panel said there was ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against."" It reached the same conclusion about the drug remdesivir.

The expert panel, convened by the NIH Institute that Dr. Anthony Fauci directs, produced a set of guidelines for doctors to use in treating COVID-19 patients. The panelists come from a variety of health care disciplines. For the most part, the guidelines are agnostic about the use of experimental medications, pointing out that strong scientific evidence is lacking to make a firm conclusion one way or the other.

But occasionally, there are recommendations explicitly against certain therapies. For example, the panel recommended against using Lopinavir/ritonavir or other HIV protease inhibitors because of negative clinical trial data. It also recommended against using interferon because it seemed to make patients with SARS and MERS worse. Those diseases are caused by a coronavirus related to the one causing COVID-19.

""It's all based on the data,"" said panel member Dr. Susan Swindells, a professor in the department of internal medicine at the University of Nebraska College of Medine. ""We just plowed through everything that was, and apart from supportive care, there wasn't anything that was working terribly well.""

The panel also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend any kind of treatment either to prevent infection with the coronavirus or to prevent the progression of symptoms in those who are already infectious. That recommendation could change based on clinical trials presently underway.

Both hydroxychloroquine and convalescent serum are being studied for the possible use for prophylaxis, but the results from those trials are not available. Many of the recommendations aren't terribly surprising. Persons who test positive for the coronavirus but don't have symptoms should self-isolate for seven days after their first positive test.

Patients with mild symptoms should be monitored closely, because more serious symptoms can come on rapidly. Patients with moderate symptoms will likely need hospitalization and supportive therapy. People with severe disease may need oxygen through a cannula, or tube; patients in critical condition may need to be place on a respirator.

The plan is to update the guidelines frequently as new results become available. Swindells said there could be an update about the recommendations regarding remdesivir in the coming week or so.",real
868,138,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/covid-19-diagnostics-still-not-meeting-demand/,2020-03-24,COVID-19 Diagnostics Still Not Meeting The Demand,"Since being given the green light from the FDA only 10 days ago Roche has delivered over 400,000 COVID-19 test kits to over 30 laboratories across the nation, but it could take weeks to months for the industry as a whole to catch up to the widespread testing that is required.

“Demand continues to be much higher than supply,” CEO Severin Schwan said in an interview Monday with CNBC. “The good news is that, in addition over the last week, other companies have received approval for their respective tests. So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing.”

“But the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible,” Schwan said. “It’s really of utmost importance to prioritize testing—to focus testing where we can get the highest impact for patients and the healthcare system. That means we have to prioritize high-risk patients and patients with signs and symptoms of the disease.”

Roche was given the go ahead from the FDA within 24 hours of receiving the application, since that time the FDA has told commercial diagnostic developers they can proceed with their own validated tests and submit an Emergency Use Authorization application within 15 days afterwards.

The FDA has also granted Thermo Fisher, Hologic, LabCorp, Quidel, Abbot, DiaSorin, GenMark and Primerdesign emergency authorizations, as well as its first point of care COVID-19 test that was developed by Cepheid.

Even with this it will still take time to build up enough stock to support the widespread screening of all people suspected to be infected, even those who may be asymptomatic, in the ideal approach to help contain the further spread of COVID-19.

“We’re still a couple of weeks, if not months, out,” he said. “On the one hand, the industry is increasing capacities. But infections are even increasing faster.” According to international health organizations the number of confirmed cases has more than doubled in the past 4 days.",fake
873,326,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/15/21222506/fact-check-covid19-testing-lori-lightfoot-illinois-coronavirus,2020-04-15,Fact-check: Testing Lightfoot’s COVID-19 claim yields mixed results,"The U.S. still lags behind a number of other countries in the share of its population that’s been tested for COVID-19. But how do individual states within the U.S. compare with one another?

That’s a subject Mayor Lori Lightfoot raised at a news conference while highlighting the need for increased testing capacity in Illinois to respond to the outbreak.

“Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing because of the availability,” Lightfoot said on April 7. “It’s not for lack of desire, it’s for lack of the tests themselves, the reagents, some of the other materials that we need to be able to process the tests.”

Illinois, like many states, has struggled to expand testing due to the national shortage of tests and other supplies. And while the numbers are improving, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the state is still falling short of the goal he set for performing 10,000 tests per day. In an interview aired on April 14, the governor said the state is now conducting almost 8,000.

But Illinois is not unique in the testing challenges it is facing, so we wondered whether the state was really as far behind as Lightfoot suggested.

In response to our inquiry, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office acknowledged testing figures have improved somewhat from several weeks ago, but provided a March 27 report from ABC 7 that found more than half of all states had done more testing than Illinois had after accounting for population size, including neighboring Wisconsin.

Those results were based on data from March 26 — almost two weeks before the mayor made her comparison. Given how rapidly testing data are fluctuating, we decided to evaluate her claim based on more recent figures.

To do that, we turned to data from the COVID Tracking Project, a source Lightfoot’s office pointed to in a later response.

The project, which is managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, gathers data from state health departments around the country and provides figures on the total number of tests conducted by both public and commercial labs.

Its database shows Lightfoot was partly right and partly wrong when she said Illinois was testing at a rate that put it behind all its neighbors as well as in the “bottom tier” nationwide.

The day Lightfoot made her claim, Illinois ranked 28 out of all 50 states for testing on a per capita basis, figures from the project show. Its ranking has improved only slightly in the time since, with the state coming in 24th as of April 14. Its current tally of just over 110,600 total tests comes out to about 8,730 tests per million residents. New York, which tops the list, has run more than 25,650 tests per million.

But Lightfoot’s Illinois comparison doesn’t hold when it comes to the states it borders. On the day she made her claim, Illinois came out slightly ahead of Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa. And in the days since, its lead has continued to grow.

Given how frequently testing figures change — along with differences in the ways states report their data — that lead in the Midwest may not mean much. But it’s enough to show Lightfoot is incorrect in her assertion that Illinois is trailing the region.

Our ruling

Lightfoot said, “Illinois lags way behind all of our neighbors and certainly we’re in the bottom tier of states that are doing testing.”

At the time Lightfoot made her statement, Illinois did lag a majority of states nationally in terms of the share of its population that had been tested for COVID-19, according to data compiled by an independent reporting project.

But the same dataset shows Illinois tested — and continues to test — more residents per capita than the states it borders.

We rate Lightfoot’s claim Half True.

HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Research by JPMorgan shows that the coronavirus infection rates of states that have ended their lockdowns have declined, “even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag.” The incubation period for coronavirus has a median time of four to five days, and as long as 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“JPMorgan has a devastating piece arguing that infection rates have declined — not increased — in states where lockdowns have ended, ‘even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag,'” Quintanilla wrote of the report by Marko Kolanovic, the Global Head of Macro Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy team at JPMorgan.

“Same goes for various countries, adds JPM. ‘This means that the pandemic and COVID-19 likely have its own dynamics unrelated to often inconsistent lockdown measures that were being implemented,'” Quintanilla tweeted. – READ MORE

The deadline for bids was supposed to be March 27th, but is now July 14th, according to the USPS. The program could award up to $6 billion in contracts to one or multiple bidders, and it’s expected to result in the manufacturing of nearly 200,000 new mail trucks. Some of the bidders have been working on all-electric versions, others have explored hybrid options, and one — a joint effort from Ford and military vehicle manufacturer Oshkosh — is working on a gas-powered version.

The program to replace the USPS’s current trucks was launched in 2015. But it has dragged on, forcing the Postal Service to keep its current trucks in service past their expected life span — despite the fact that they were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and lack features like air conditioning. Two of the original six companies have dropped out.

The current trucks are past their expiration date

One of the four remaining companies is Workhorse, a struggling electric vehicle startup that has many of its eggs in the USPS contract basket. Founded in 1998 as a commercial van manufacturer, it was bought by trucking giant Navistar in 2005, which eventually shut it down. AMP Electric Vehicles, a company focused on retrofitting combustion engine cars with EV powertrains, bought the IP in 2013 and assumed the Workhorse name.

The new Workhorse developed electric (and electric-assisted) commercial trucks and vans, some of which were bought by the likes of Ryder and UPS. The company also expanded into drones and started working on an electric pickup truck. But as sales of the trucks and vans dried up, Workhorse has taken on big loans from multiple investment firms to stay alive. It sold off its drone division, and sold the EV pickup truck IP to its former CEO, whose new startup Lordstown Motors bought an old General Motors plant. Workhorse, which received more than $1 million as part of the coronavirus Paycheck Protection Program, even recently bought out its partner in the mail truck program (trucking manufacturer VT Hackney) in order to keep its bid alive.

The other remaining competitors include the North American arm of Indian conglomerate Mahindra, which is working on both a combustion engine and a hybrid mail truck. Karsan, a Turkish commercial vehicle manufacturer, is working with Michigan-based USPS supplier Morgan Olson on a plug-in hybrid mail truck.

Amazon, which relies on the USPS but has been steadily building a proprietary delivery infrastructure for years, is undergoing its own major push to electrify its fleet. The company has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from EV startup Rivian as part of a big investment announced last year.",real

Former A’s manager Art Howe, who tested positive for COVID-19 on May 5 is out of the ICU and back home, according to Yahoo Sports.

Howe, 73, second to Tony La Russa with 600 wins in Oakland A’s history, will remain in isolation at home for a few weeks, The Washington Post reported.

“Relief, back in my own bedroom, it’s just sweet,” Howe said to reporters. “I’m finally feeling a little bit better. Still not able to eat real good, taste buds are giving me a hard time.

Howe said he has lost taste and smell.

“I know I should eat but nothing at all makes you want to eat,” he said to a Houston-area TV station.

During his hospitalization he received several get well wishes from players and reporters who still appreciate his genial nature.

Pitcher Tom Candiotti spent his only season with the A’s in 1998. Howe was his manager. Asked then about what kind of a guy Howe was, Candiotti said:

”He was my manager in 1985 winter ball, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. I went up to him and said, ‘Do you mind if I throw some knuckleballs?’ I hadn’t thrown it that much, and I wanted to work on it.”

”He said, ‘Have at it.’ The one thing you can take to the bank is Art’s patience,” Candiotti said, noting that managers flock to winter ball for the same reason players do — to get noticed. Allowing a pitcher to work on his knuckleball could have repercussions on a prospective manager. Howe didn’t blink.

The Fed says it will name companies that participate in its lending programs.The Federal Reserve will disclose the names of companies that benefit from its lending programs, it announced Thursday, a sign that the central bank is willing to provide the kind of transparency lawmakers have been urging.
The central bank will release the names and details of participants in each of its programs, the amount borrowed and interest rate charged, and overall costs, revenues and fees, it said. The Fed will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days.
Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up Fed lending facilities, which either make loans or buy bonds to keep credit flowing in key market segments. With that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments and large corporations.
But the backing came with some reporting requirements, as do the Fed’s emergency lending authorities in general: Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin must regularly report to Congress on the programs, for instance. It was unclear how detailed those explanations would be until Thursday’s release laid out the parameters.
“The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability,” Mr. Powell said in the release.
L Brands fires back after the buyer of Victoria’s Secret tries to pull out.
L Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, shot back at the private equity firm that has been trying to terminate its acquisition of the retail chain
The effort on the part of the firm, Sycamore Partners, to end the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak is “invalid” and “pure gamesmanship” after it failed to renegotiate the price, L Brands said in a Delaware court filing on Thursday
The dispute has become the most prominent example of a buyer trying to back out of a deal because of the pandemic.
Sycamore said on Wednesday that L Brands had violated terms of its February transaction agreement and that a “material adverse effect” occurred because of the pandemic, allowing it to terminate the deal to buy 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret for about $525 million.
L Brands said on Thursday that when the deal was negotiated, “the world was already well aware of the existence of Covid-19, and the parties agreed that Sycamore would bear the risk of any adverse impacts stemming from such a pandemic.” The definition of a “material adverse effect” explicitly carved out impacts from pandemics, the company said.
The company called Sycamore’s stance “pure gamesmanship.” Sycamore sent L Brands a letter on April 13 saying that it wanted to renegotiate the purchase price and other terms of the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to L Brands. When the company declined to renegotiate — because the agreement “expressly allocates the risk of pandemics to Sycamore” — the private equity firm sent a termination notice and filed the subsequent lawsuit, according to the filing.
Early May is too soon to reopen auto factories, the U.A.W. says.
The United Automobile Workers union said on Thursday that it was opposed to companies restarting auto production next month, saying it is not yet safe for its members to return to work.
“At this point in time, the U.A.W. does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace,” the union’s president, Rory Gamble, said in a statement. “We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face.”
The union represents more than 400,000 workers and is an influential voice in the labor movement and manufacturing industry.
Mr. Gamble added the union supported an extension of the stay-at-home order in effect in Michigan. That order, by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, expires on April 30 but she has said she expected an extension was warranted.
“We strongly suggest to our companies that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families, and their communities,” Mr. Gamble said.
General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler have been discussing with the union when and how they will reopen plants.
The union’s statement comes as some nonunion automakers announce plans to resume production in southern states that have not been hit as hard by the virus as Michigan, where 3,000 people, including more than two dozen U.A.W. members, have died from the coronavirus.
Earlier on Thursday, Toyota Motor said it was preparing to restart operations at its U.S. plants on May 4. Volkswagen has said it would begin phasing in production at its U.S. plant on May 3.
Stocks lose steam but oil prices continue their rebound.
Stocks on Wall Street ended virtually unchanged on Thursday as an early rally, fueled by a surge in oil prices, faded.
The S&P 500, which rose as much as 1.6 percent earlier in the day, was flat by the close of trading. The ups and downs came as investors absorbed more grim economic news: Millions more workers claimed unemployment benefits in the United States and data from Europe highlighted the heavy toll of shutdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Investors have been shrugging off such data in recent weeks, as the shock of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic fades and they begin to expect an eventual recovery.
Governments have started to discuss measures to return to normal. Businesses in Europe and the United States have begun to detail their plans to reopen businesses. Major airlines have already aggressively advertised the precautions they are taking to lure back passengers, from fogging cabins with disinfectant to restricting food service to blocking out middle seats.
Lawmakers in Washington continue to advance measures to support the economy. The House will vote on Thursday on a $484 billion coronavirus package that would revive a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals and testing.
More than 26 million people have filed jobless claims in the last five weeks.
The grim economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped on Thursday when the government reported another 4.4 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million.
The report is likely to intensify the debate over when to lift restrictions that have helped fight the virus’s spread but placed the economy in a stranglehold, reports Patricia Cohen of The Times.
“At all levels, it’s eye-watering numbers,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. But as large as the figures have been, they do not capture the full extent of layoffs — or the cascade of economic troubles that they have set in motion.
Problems responding to the waves of jobless claims now will affect the shape of the recovery when the pandemic eases, Mr. Slok said. Laid-off workers need money quickly to pay for rent, groceries and credit card bills. If they cannot do so, he said, the hole that the larger economy has fallen into “gets deeper and deeper, and more difficult to crawl out of.”
The Treasury warns big companies not to take small-business loans.
The Trump administration warned big companies on Thursday that they must prove they were in need of emergency small business loans to keep their operations running and had no other option to get financing or repay the funds.
The new guidance from the Treasury Department came amid an uproar over bigger companies taking loans through the Paycheck Protection Program while smaller businesses have been left out.
The Treasury Department updated its “Frequently Asked Questions” page about the P.P.P. to urge “large companies with adequate sources of liquidity” to think twice before applying for loans backed by the Small Business Administration.
The S.B.A.’s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished with another $310 billion this week. Backlash over the program has been escalating after some big restaurant chains took out multiple $10 million loans for their subsidiaries.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned businesses that they would be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged such businesses to return those funds. The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repaid loans in full by May 7, 2020, would be deemed by the S.B.A. to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government.
At least five companies have already given back the funds: Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, Kura Sushi USA, ItWorks! and the owner of Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, have all disclosed that they have returned the P.P.P. loans.
Another publicly traded company, Wave Life Sciences USA, announced on Thursday it was returning $7.2 million in a loan from JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks that handled aid applications using a two-tiered system that heavily favored larger companies and wealthy clients over the smallest businesses.
“We made this decision after the S.B.A. issued new guidance that states, in effect, that public companies are not appropriate recipients of these loans,” ” a spokeswoman for the company, Alicia Suter, said in an email.
Entrepreneurs are learning in real time how to adapt to survive.
A Memphis food tour company joined with local restaurants to offer a special meal and video tour to locals. The owners of a Detroit bar and scent shop froze cocktail mixers into ice cubes so patrons could just add liquor at home to mix the perfect drink. A laundry service for Airbnb rentals in Minneapolis started a curbside business for people stuck inside their homes.
Small-businesses owners across the country are looking for ways to survive the coronavirus pandemic, even as they fill out paperwork for federal stimulus funds that they no longer believe they can count on. They are adapting their business models and innovating products so that they, and their employees, can get back to work.
“Small businesses are really great at staying nimble,” said Laura Huang, associate professor at Harvard Business School and author of “Edge: Turning Adversity Into Advantage.” The ones that succeed, she said, “understand that even though they are looking to do new, innovative things, they need to grow where they are planted.”
That means that small-business owners should not completely change what they do but find new ways to deliver their product, dust off old ideas, experiment with existing strengths, search for new customers or change their story.
Macy’s plans its Fourth of July fireworks show, but the expense is questioned.
When Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Wednesday that Macy’s and its chief executive, Jeff Gennette, were committed to holding its annual Fourth of July fireworks display, he called the gesture “generous” and “really patriotic.”
But critics questioned the expense at a time when most of Macy’s 123,000 employees have been furloughed. The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdales and Bluemercury, is facing intense financial pressure with the temporary closure of its stores.
“Macy’s should not be spending millions on fireworks displays while its own work force is out of work,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday. The company should be spending the money on health care coverage for employees instead, he added.
Macy’s does not disclose the cost of the show, though Mr. de Blasio suggested in a briefing on Thursday that this year’s display might be more modest. Macy’s said the display dates to 1976 and that this year’s show “will be a celebration of the strength and resilience of New York City and will honor frontline workers across America.”
Mr. de Blasio defended the plans to proceed with the pyrotechnics show. “I don’t think it’s an either-or,” he said. “Macy’s put aside the resources to provide this celebration.” The cost of the show, he added, was “small compared to the needs of working people.”
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Intel, one of the world’s largest computer chip makers, said Thursday that revenue climbed 23 percent to $19.8 billion during the quarter ending in March, an indication that parts of the computer industry are thriving amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company expects revenue to be $18.5 billion in the current quarter — up $2 billion from last year.Besieged by the economic tumult created by the coronavirus, the private equity giant Blackstone swung to a loss of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, a steep slide from the same period last year, when the company reported $1.1 billion in profit.Starting Friday, all 25,000 United Airlines flight attendants will be required to wear masks while on duty, the airline said. United is the first major U.S. airline to mandate masks. The union that represents flight attendants there and at more than a dozen other airlines separately asked the Transportation Department and Health and Human Services Department to mandate the same industrywide.Exxon Mobil said on Thursday it would produce medical-grade hand sanitizer in Louisiana. The company plans to initially make 160,000 gallons, enough for nearly five million bottles, which will be donated to health care providers in Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.The beef and pork subsidiary of Tyson Foods will halt production at its beef facility in Pasco, Wash., while local health officials test more than 1,400 workers there for the coronavirus. Workers will continue to be paid while the plant is closed. Tyson is working with health officials on a plan to resume production. Tyson also said it would close its meat plant in Shelbyville, Tenn., on Monday to do a deep cleaning.The German airline Lufthansa warned Thursday that it would require government bailouts after plummeting sales led to a loss of more than a billion euros in the first quarter. Passenger traffic has fallen to almost nothing and the second quarter will be even worse, Lufthansa said in a statement.Target reported Thursday that sales since February were up 7 percent, with in-store sales falling slightly and online purchases jumping 100 percent.

913,856,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/how-a-30-year-old-nurse-fighting-covid-19-in-detroit-spends-his-money.html,2020-05-13,The budget breakdown of a nurse working on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic in Detroit,"This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which profiles people around the world and details how they earn, spend and save their money. Ron Navarro is a self-described ""late bloomer"" when it comes to money. The now-30-year-old didn't really pay attention to his finances, he says, until he went to nursing school in the Philippines in 2010 at age 20. It took living — and budgeting — on his own in another country for him to get his money into shape. The Philippines shaped his financial viewpoint in other ways, too. Though he moved back to Michigan, six years ago, he still mostly uses cash to pay for things, he says, which is common in the Philippines. He splits his household expenses with his mother, Gertrudes, and his wife, Carmela. Everyone contributes what they can, and there's rarely arguments over who bought what, or who pitched in more or less. ""One thing about the Philippines is that not a lot of people have credit cards,"" he says. ""Even though people there might not have as much money, they really don't have debt. They help each other out as a family.""

That family mentality also shapes how Navarro approaches his work in the U.S. As a registered nurse in the emergency department of DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, Navarro is on the frontlines of the pandemic in one of the hardest-hit regions in the country. ""People are passing away with loved ones on the phone. They're usually alone,"" Navarro told CNBC Make It in April, just as the city's daily Covid cases and deaths were beginning to fall. ""We're the ones that take place of their loved ones. It's been especially difficult to see patients enter the hospital ""walking and talking,"" he says, only to be intubated – the term used when a person has a tube inserted to help them breathe — and unresponsive a few hours later. But he views it as his duty to care for the community no matter the circumstances, referencing the Florence Nightingale Pledge for nurses, which puts the welfare of the community before individuals.

""I have seen and heard of coworkers, veteran nurses [and] doctors who teared up, something that you don't really see,"" he says. In the E.R. ""people there are pretty tough. And we have to be because we see a lot of things."" It helps, he says, that he is eligible for overtime pay. Navarro earned around $90,000 pre-tax last year with overtime. In the first few weeks of the outbreak, he worked 12-hour shifts, four-to-five days per week. Recently, though, he's scaled back his time to his regular schedule of three, 12-hour days per week at the behest of his mother and wife, who worry about his exposure to the virus. He estimates he'll make around the same amount this year. Navarro's mother came to the United States from the Philippines in the 1970s, and she was a nurse at the same hospital where her son works. She retired in 2014. One of the big differences between their experiences, he says, is that his mother receives a pension from the hospital, which the family puts toward their bills. Navarro will not receive that when he retires, as it's no longer offered to hospital employees.

But that doesn't bother Navarro. It's a blessing to be able to do what he loves while earning decent money. ""I love nursing, taking care of people,"" he says. ""It's an honor to be helping those in need.""

Living and working in Michigan

Navarro lives in the house he grew up in in Troy, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, with Carmela and his mother. He splits many of his monthly expenses with his wife and mother, and the exact breakdown of who pays for what depends on the month. ""It is actually pretty common for Asians, and for Filipinos, to pass down what they have,"" he says.

Though his mother and father had paid off the house before they gave it to their son, Navarro decided to renovate it in 2015. The couple also purchased a condo in the Philippines in 2018, where Carmela grew up and where Navarro lived for four years while he attended nursing school. He feels like rushing the home renovation is not only his biggest financial mistake, but he admits it's the biggest fight he's had about money with Carmela and his mother. He took out a $180,000 mortgage on his house, and used $100,000 for renovations and $80,000 to buy an income property in the Philippines, which he plans to rent out to earn extra money.

""Sometimes that's how I am. When I want something, I do everything at once,"" he says. In hindsight, he wishes he had padded his emergency fund more instead of spending so much renovating the house, but as the family is still living well within their means, he's giving himself grace for the hasty decision making. Navarro completely remodeled the first floor of the house, ripping out carpet and wood paneling from the 1970s, and adding new appliances to the kitchen. They also updated the landscaping and added a new staircase to the basement. Now, he's in a comfortable spot. With his salary, his wife's income (Carmela works in accounts receivable for Beaumont Health Systems in Detroit) and his mother's pension, the family makes well above the $97,000 median household income for his area.

They are also able to send $300 to Carmela's family in the Philippines every month. They have helped send both of her younger siblings to college. Navarro thinks of it as repayment for the help and support the family provided him when he lived in the Philippines for four years. ""I can never pay them back fully,"" he adds. ""Like the saying goes, money doesn't buy happiness, but it sure can help.""

How the Navarro family budgets

So far, the pandemic has done little to change the family's budget. His wife is still working, and Navarro is bringing in more money than usual thanks to overtime.

Even before the pandemic, Navarro and his wife spent most of their time at home: Because of his atypical work schedule, they went out once every other weekend at most. ""My wife and I, we don't really buy a lot of stuff,"" he says, aside from travel — the couple went to Japan last year — and their two cars, which they hope to pay off in full this summer. The couple put their stimulus relief checks in their emergency fund. Here's the family's estimated monthly spending as of May 2020:

CNBC Make It

Savings: $1,600

$1,600 Housing: $1,515

$1,515 Transportation: $1,232 for car and truck payments, gas

$600 Utilities : $480

$300 Phone: $150

$150 Subscriptions: $71 for Amazon Prime, his gym, Netflix, etc. While Navarro is the breadwinner, the three family members split monthly expenses between themselves. His mother helps with groceries, for example, and pays for her own medical expenses. ""We all pitch in in our own ways,"" he says. ""We just all help each other out."" Navarro personally saves $1,600 per month: $400 goes to his liquid savings account, $700 is invested in his 401(k) and he invests an additional $500 in a Roth IRA. He has $1,400 in savings and nearly $40,000 saved for retirement.

After that, his family's biggest expense is housing, including a $50 monthly fee for their condo in the Philippines (the rest of the condo is paid off) and the monthly mortgage payment on their home in Troy. They also pay around $480 per month for cable, Wi-Fi, heat, electricity and other utilities. The family of three spends around $600 on food, mostly on groceries to prepare meals at home.

What the experts say

CNBC Make It asked Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of Charles Schwab Foundation and certified financial planner, to comment on what Navarro is doing right with his money and where he could improve.

Schwab-Pomerantz is impressed with where Navarro stands now. ""With zero credit card balance, the investment property paid off, and his vehicles almost paid off, Ron is in a great position to secure his financial future,"" she tells CNBC Make It. Contributing to both a 401(k) and Roth IRA is a great way to have diversified income streams in retirement, she says. He should keep that up as long as he can. And while he's saving a not-insignificant portion of his salary now, she says increasing the ""buffer"" of his savings account should be his priority going forward. This is especially true with an investment property to take care of — where unexpected costs may creep up — and with the family contributions he and Carmela are making.

""When Ron finishes paying off his cars, he should consider increasing his savings rates that much more,"" she says, which means he could save an additional $900 or more a month. Carmela, too, ""can contribute earnings to her own retirement accounts."" Finally, Schwab-Pomerantz says it's crucial for Navarro to put his mental and physical health first, especially in such a demanding field. Overtime pay is great, but he also needs to take time for himself and his family. ""While Ron has opportunities for over-time as a registered nurse, it's important that he takes care of his health and doesn't overdo it,"" she says. ""Taking care of his mental and physical health is the best way for Ron to protect his earnings potential and continue taking care of his family, and patients.""

960,626,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/map-us-still-staying-home-coronavirus/,2020-05-06,Where Americans are still staying at home the most,"If youâre still at home, youâre not alone.

After a peak week of sheltering in place in early April, U.S. residents began to inch out of their homes, according to new cellphone data. But even as states begin to âopen up,â more Americans appear to be staying put than sprinting out the door.

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on: March 1 April 1 April 7 April 30 Less time at home More 65 % 70 % 75 % 80 % 85 % 90 % 95 % Use two fingers to pan around the map.

Hover to explore county details Note: Counties with fewer than 100 devices in the dataset are shown in gray. Source: Washington Post analysis of SafeGraph data. See full methodology at bottom of article.

According to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.

Some governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.

The numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.

Beaches and parks, such as this one in Jacksonville Beach, reopened April 17 â with restrictions â in Duval County, Fla. (Charlotte Kesl for The Washington Post)

To determine when people are home, SafeGraph obtains GPS data through regular pings from smartphones that are running one or more apps from an undisclosed list. (This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)

[Itâs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]

The company defines âhomeâ as a common location from which a phone pings between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. When the phone pings from elsewhere, SafeGraph assumes the phone is away from home.

Itâs not a perfect measure, but the data, aggregated from an average of 18 million phones per day, reveals broad insights.

Hereâs where people are going

Just because people are leaving their homes more doesnât mean theyâre flouting stay-at-home orders or that theyâve abandoned social distancing. They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.

[Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]

Pings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are â and arenât â showing up. Theyâre going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.

Park visits have trended upward recently.

Workplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.

SafeGraphâs more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.

The data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldnât be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.

State orders donât necessarily dictate behavior

While governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.

One of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.

Some states are starting to leave home more than others

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date

New Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan

In New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.

Montanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.

Alaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.

Variations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often â but not always â follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.

In Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the stateâs covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.

[Where people have died of covid-19 by county]

Areas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsythâs.

In Arizonaâs La Paz County, residents are away from home 25 percent more than they were at the peak â the largest change of any county in the country â and theyâre home just 57 percent of the time, roughly the same rate as in early March. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.

In general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.

The data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.

About this story

Data for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.

The raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each âdayâ of data including five week and two weekend days.

This analysis relies on defining a âhomeâ location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraphâs at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.

Urbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statisticsâs urban-rural classification scheme.

Here is the latest as of Thursday, May 21.

Health officials have been cautioning all along that the number of confirmed cases, and the list of locations, don’t show the disease’s true prevalence. Researchers working in L.A. County found in April that the number of people who have actually contracted COVID-19 was probably 28 to 55 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.

As of Thursday, 42,138 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the outbreak began, up 3% (1,163 cases) from the day before and 19% from a week before. That is based on the latest reports from L.A. County and the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments and are typically at least a day ahead of the county in reporting their cities’ numbers.

Another 45 deaths were announced Thursday, bringing the county’s toll to 2,021.

So far, about 403,000 people have been tested for the coronavirus in L.A. County. That represents 3.96% of the county’s population.

County officials are releasing some additional information that does not include the cases in Long Beach and Pasadena.

India from 18 May will enter phase four of the lockdown, which began on 25 March.

India went under complete lockdown on 25 March to contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected 4,281,838 people worldwide and claimed 292,376 lives. The scientific community across the globe is working on different drugs and conducting clinical trials to figure out a way to end the spread of the virus.

Director of India’s National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Ahmedabad, Kiran Kalia talked to Sputnik about the current status of vaccine development, its production, as well as available drugs and treatments.

Sputnik: Scientists across the world are working on vaccines and drugs to find a cure for COVID-19. Where is India in the effort of making an effective drug/vaccine against the virus?

Kiran Kalia: We have phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials for the vaccines going on in foreign countries, but as our principal scientific advisor Dr Vijay Raghvan has mentioned, 30 different attempts are going on in India to develop the vaccine. The important one is the one by the National Institute of Virology in Pune. They have transferred the virus strain to Bharat Biotech International Limited. And they are developing the vaccine partnered with the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research).

We have a good manufacturing capability at Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with Oxford University to produce a large amount of vaccine doses. Although the Oxford University Vaccine is under phase 2 trial, they are so sure about the outputs of the trial that they have even started manufacturing. So when they get the trial result, they will have a lot of doses available for people.

These are the two vaccines where we are hopeful of the output.

Zydus Cadila, in the Indian scenario, is also working on a nucleic acid-based vaccine programme because they have their own independent vaccine production unit. We are hopeful Zydus will come out with some good vaccines.

Sputnik: When do we expect these vaccines to come into use?

Kiran Kalia: Vaccination will not start unless we get approval from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Because the clinical trials are going on, once they are over, only then can vaccination take place.

When any organisation, like Oxford University, has given good candidates for a vaccine; they are very sure about their result. They know that since this has cleared phase 1, phase 2 trial, they have even gone to the animal studies and found that it is a very effective vaccine. Based upon the previous data and how it has developed, you become sure that it will clear the final clinical trials on humans. If you are confident in your data, we take the risk of producing. Because we are in a situation where we don’t have sufficient time to wait for the trials to get over and then wait for production, which itself would take time. Maybe by the end of the year, we will have the vaccine. India has huge manufacturing capacity and whichever country comes with the vaccine after clearing the clinical trial, we will probably be the hub for making doses for them.

Sputnik: Like hyroxychloronique, what are the other drugs which are under consideration for treatment?

Kiran Kalia: Production of HCQ has had a little bit controversy due to the cardiac toxicity, but apart from the patients who are having cardiac complications, it has shown some beneficial effects on the other patients.

A lot of work is going on in the re-purposing of the existing anti-viral drugs. At NIPER also we are working in collaboration with the IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) Delhi and we have come out with some of the important molecules which show good potential as therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

Sputnik: How effective is the ayurvedic treatment?

Kiran Kalia: Ayurvedic organisation and AYUSH are also giving good recommendations for boosting immunity and the use of ancient knowledge of herbs, which they are trying on COVID patients. We have developed a similar strategy with Troikaa Pharma, where immunity boosters such as Zinc, selenium, Vitamin doses are given in combination with ayurvedic herbs and recommended breathing exercises. Such a support system is good for asymptomatic patients who are quarantined.

Some of the employees at Troikaa Pharma got infected with the virus, so we started giving them the treatment as they were quarantined in their houses and after 10 days of the diagnosis, they recovered. And when others at the office were given the same, none of them developed COVID.

It is not a treatment but a preventive measure with a combination strategy to improve immunity.

Sputnik: Are we going to see another wave of COVID-19 and a rise in cases?

Kiran Kalia: You cannot have a lockdown for this long. But people have to control themselves. Even when we open the lockdown, it will be opened in a restricted manner. This is a good stand. But if the green zone is open, then it should be under certain lockdown so that people from the orange and red zones do not go into it. But there are various factors in a country like ours where there is a huge population, and the socio-economic structure of the country is different from the developed countries. But ultimately, if you open up, this will develop herd immunity in the population. Although we believe us Indians have a good immunity system, probably when we develop herd immunity in our people, it may not spur very high. But this is all speculation. It is based on a certain growth rate and recovery rate, but the situation is different state-wise.

If it wasn’t for the lockdown, the situation in India would have been much worse.",fake
973,1131,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/starbucks-rent-relief-12-months-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders/,2020-05-15,Starbucks is asking landlords for a break on rent,"What do millions of Americans and Starbucks have in common? Both want a break on the rent.

According to The Seattle Times, the coffee giant is pressing landlords to offer rent relief for its stores, citing the coronavirus's impact on sales. ""Effective June 1, and for at least a period of 12 consecutive months, Starbucks will require concessions to support modified operations and adjustments to lease terms and base rent structures,"" Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer wrote in a May letter to landlords.

Starbucks hasn't said where around the U.S. it is asking for rent relief. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer said during the company's most recent earnings call that ""we've not yet confirmed those arrangements, and it's really premature to indicate what that relief may look like.""

Like many retailers, Starbucks's business has been deeply affected by the pandemic. It temporarily closed 2,000 restaurants across China after the outbreak erupted in Wuhan. China and the U.S. account for 61% of Starbuck's presence worldwide, with 15,257 stores in the U.S. and 4,351 in China. Starbucks plans to reopen 90% of its U.S. locations in early June.

U.S. retail sales hit record low as Trump looks ahead to reopening economy

Starbucks reported $6 billion in revenue during the second quarter, down 5% from the previous year, while store sales globally fell 10% from the previous year.

Coronavirus has caused ""a staggering economic crisis,"" and ""the psychological and economic scars will last for months, if not years,"" Brewer wrote in the letter. Brick-and-mortar retailers won't reach the same level of sales and income as before the pandemic, so landlords must be willing to ""adapt to new realities,"" she wrote, according to the Seattle Times.

""This is the worst recession since the Great Depression and far more devastating than the global financial crisis,"" Brewer wrote. ""What lays ahead is daunting but by no means insurmountable with a shared commitment and a clear path forward.""",real

Baseball without COVID-19 sounds hard to believe.,"Everyone needs hope, especially now, even if it’s a tiny dot of light at the end of a long tunnel. I don’t know if sports can provide that, but it can provide a sliver of normalcy, and that’s what most of us want right now. We’d like as close to normal as we can get, as fast as we can get it.

So baseball games without fans in the seats? Yes, please. No runs, no hits, no errors and nobody in the stands? No problem. It would be strange for a while, then we’d get used to it.

But a dose of reality: Does anyone really believe a season could be played without players getting infected with the coronavirus? And does anybody really believe the season wouldn’t be shut down at the first hint of a positive test?

Major League Baseball is considering a plan in which its 30 teams would compete at spring-training sites in the Phoenix area, as well as at the Diamondbacks’ ballpark, possibly as soon as May. Players, coaches and essential personnel would live in hotels away from their families.

If there’s a more miserable existence than being isolated with 25 major-league ballplayers for five months, it has yet to be invented. I know: You’d sequester yourself with 25 telemarketers if it meant millions of dollars in your bank account. But in the case of ballplayers, that’s a lot of video games, ornery personalities, hunting stories and pent-up, um, urges. If Phoenix-area bars were to open during the season, would you trust a libidinous teammate to continue watching reruns of “Baywatch”? And how soon before he brings COVID-19 to the clubhouse?

To rally the troops for ninth-inning comebacks, managers like to say, “All it takes is one.’’ One hit to turn the tide. And all it takes is one positive test to shut down the season again.

I want this to work. I find it hard to believe it can.

Players take infield practice before each game, touching baseballs that have been in the hand of the coach hitting to them. The players throw those baseballs to a first baseman, who also touches them. It’s a germfest out there. A pitcher and catcher touch the same ball often during the game. A batboy delivers balls to the umpire several times over nine innings. Et cetera.

And spitting! It’s what baseball players do between breaths. They spit saliva, they spit sunflower seeds and some still spit tobacco. They spit when they wake up, and they spit when they go to bed. It’s reasonable to expect that they’ll spit wherever they sit during games. It’s reasonable to expect that teammates will step on those expectorations, spreading whatever there is to be spread.

Little things we take for granted will come with question marks. The big things — one player sliding into another, trading sweat — seem like major stumbling blocks. I’m assuming teammates will be sharing clubhouse washrooms, showers and weight rooms. Who will be cleaning players’ hotel rooms? Serving food to them? Hard to believe those people will be cloistered from their families, too.

(I’m not worried about mound visits. Players have been talking through their gloves for years. It’s baseball’s version of N95 masks.)

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it’s possible for pro sports to return in 2020.

“There’s a way of doing that,” he said on “Good Luck America,” an interview series from Snapchat. “(No fans come) to the stadium. Put (the players) in big hotels wherever you want to play. Keep them very well-surveilled and have them tested, like every week, and make sure they don’t wind up infecting each other or their family and just let them play the season out.”

Scientists in China have found that people infected with COVID-19 likely are spreading the disease for up to 2½ days before showing symptoms. Or, as the Los Angeles Times puts it, “an infected person can walk around feeling fine for more than two full days while spewing virus into the air, depositing it onto doorknobs and handrails, and sowing the seeds for future infections.’’

Play ball!

This brings us to the feeling of being stuck, which is one of the dark byproducts of the coronavirus. We can’t live our lives in the fear of something bad happening, but what if the odds are decent that something bad will indeed happen? Should we carry on anyway? Or should we wait for a vaccine, which might not be available for a year?

The nation is facing the same questions. When do we reopen society? Is there ever a point where the health of the economy is as important as the health of the citizenry?

Sports are being presented as a national balm to help us get through the pandemic. We know it’s really about the billions of TV dollars, but we don’t care. We want baseball back.

But how long can it last? Or, asked another way, anyone up for Esports?",real
988,506,https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2020/4/29/21241885/blackhawks-nhl-season-resumes-july-coronavirus-plan-motivation,2020-04-29,"If NHL season resumes in full in July, Blackhawks won’t have much to play for","Early in the coronavirus pandemic, when hundreds of potential scenarios for eventually resuming the 2019-20 season sat on the NHL’s desk, one idea to expand the playoff field piqued a lot of interest in Chicago.

The rationale was that if the league went straight into the postseason whenever hockey returned, bubble teams like the Jets and Blue Jackets would be unfairly denied opportunities to battle for spots down the stretch.

To resolve that injustice, the NHL mentioned potentially expanding the field. The most likely scenario was 10 per conference, but there were whispers of 12 as well — and, lo and behold, the Blackhawks ranked 12th in the West when the season stopped.

The thought that this mediocre-at-best Hawks team — six points out of a real wild card spot, with mere 3.4 percent playoff odds (per Moneypuck) — would get automatically inserted anyway was absurd but exciting.

That was weeks ago, though. Now, there’s growing optimism that the NHL will resume its season in July at one common, neutral location per division — most likely Minnesota for the Central Division — and conclude the regular season in part or full before beginning the playoffs.

That would result in the Stanley Cup being awarded in September, per a Wednesday AP report, and the 2020-21 season probably starting late. Nonetheless, it seems like the most thorough and developed plan yet.

For hockey in general, it’s great news. For the Blackhawks, though, it’s arguably disappointing: it will likely equate to much ado for a few weeks of largely meaningless games, then a return to the same nothingness that has filled April.

The real drama with the Hawks franchise right now lies off the ice, where John McDonough’s Monday firing opened up endless possibilities for the front office.

On the ice, there are approximately zero possibilities: no chance of making the playoffs, no chance of tanking for a top draft pick (barring another lottery miracle).

Corey Crawford, Malcolm Subban and Slater Koekkoek would be playing for new contracts, and Olli Maatta and Zack Smith to avoid juicy potential buyouts. And that’s about it.

Simply having hockey back at all would be rejoiced by the whole league, and the Hawks’ resident hockey nerds — Patrick Kane and Dylan Strome chief among them — would surely enjoy even watching the playoffs.

But as far as motivation to endure another training camp, an unavoidable quarantine away from family and friends and the physical bruising of several weeks of games, the Hawks would be sorely lacking.",real
1002,1141,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/can_america_bounce_back.html,2020-05-16,Can America Bounce Back?,"The shutdown of the American economy was in large part enabled by the belief that it would be short, that the federal government could borrow a large sum of money at a low interest rate to ease the suffering, and that the economy could come bouncing back in the blink of an eye, making up any losses. The shutdowns have extended so far four times longer than originally intended, with the governors and mayors of several states and cities proclaiming indefinite shutdowns. The moneys borrowed from our future were nowhere near enough to ease the pain, and who lent that money anyway? It hasn't been borrowed yet, so it's anyone's guess. Two of the three pillars supporting shutdowns have fallen, so can America's economy really come bouncing back, or was that wishful thinking, too?

Which part of the spider web is essential, and which is not?

Economic activity is a web of connections. The Defense Logistics Agency has a Small Business Innovation research grant opportunity out, DLA202-012, ""Learning from the Coronavirus: An Economic Assessment on the Effects of Pandemics on the Supply and Demand for Strategic & Critical Materials in the Defense Industrial Base."" This topic seeks a model to predict how strategic supplies of raw materials and pharmaceuticals critical for the defense sector will be affected under the new paradigms of COVID-19. Although the defense industrial and medical sectors were deemed ""essential,"" many defense supply chains were negatively impacted by the shutdown. Surprised?

Even though the ""essential"" businesses might have been excused from lockdowns, they were not generally excused from extreme social distancing requirements, impacting their work. They had to spend time and effort adapting to the new requirements, and the new materials they required to operate, such as disinfectants, hand sanitizers and acrylic glass, might have been in short supply. Even once operating, the ""essential"" businesses' suppliers might have been deemed non-essential. The businesses and materials that their employees required to maintain their personal lives might have been non-essential, thus affecting their work. Even businesses in free states might have found themselves relying on ""non-essential"" businesses in slave states, with no alternative suppliers available.

The ""essential"" businesses depended on the ""non-essential"" businesses, and the fall of one brought the other down. The only non-essential ""businesses"" that continued to pay their employees, regardless of whether they worked or not, and suffered no ills were the federal, state, and local governments. Despite continuing strong, these non-essential ""businesses"" managed to push the other businesses down farther. From an economic standpoint, the wrong thing was shut down. What part of the web is non-essential? The kid with the stick.

The lesson of economic decline is important for economic recovery. Fully one quarter of our economy is lying beaten and bruised in the mud, and those people are not going to just spring up, brush the dust off, and continue as if nothing happened. Nearly 78% of Americans lived paycheck-to-paycheck, including 10% making more than $100,000 per year. Some had too much in their homes, either in mortgages or Section 8–inflated rents. Many others, like Millennials, are lifestyle-poor. What little excess money they had went into economic consumption. Now laid off for almost two months, they are behind on their rents and utilities. Even if they were hired tomorrow, they have one sixth of a year to make up. No extra consumption until 2021; it's beans and rice to the end of the year.

What does that drop in consumption mean? Likely a short bounce followed by a drop, like an overloaded aircraft trying to take off. Businesses might take their loans and re-open and re-staff quickly, only to find in the next few months that 20% of their business is missing. That means layoffs come August–October. Even if the re-opening were to be staged, it would have the effect of prolonging the agony and likely lead to a worse drop. For example, rather than a few homeowners putting off improvement projects, a large number of unpaid landlords would start putting off projects, or banks might see loan defaults and then be unable to make merchant loans to entice people to finance projects. Quickly reopening, contractors might lose out on 20% of one sixth of a year's work, but prolonging the shutdowns mean contractors lose out on 20% of one third of a year's work or more.

A quick recovery seems unlikely, and whoever was whispering economic nonsense into the ear of President Trump seemed to have as cavalier an understanding of economics as the health and safety experts had of viral pandemics. Were they the same people?

Who are these health and safety advocates? At the end of April, the faculty, staff, and graduate students of the Harvard School of Public Health began a media blitz to counter President Trump's desire to open our economy. A review of their articles reveals that they are pushing such important epidemic-ending health concepts as single-payer health care, seizure of pharmaceutical companies, mass tracking of all people and their associations, travel papers, forced testing and vaccination, and other socialist nonesuch.

If you ever questioned who the health and safety experts were, you should have no doubts now. CNN will host a panel of coronavirus experts led by Greta Thunberg. That's right: the 17-year-old student from Stockholm, Sweden. This will be a panel of socialists advocating socialism under the guise of science, health, and safety, consisting of former acting CDC director Richard Besser, former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and TV doctor Sanjay Gupta, led by the most credentialed among them, activist Greta Thunberg. So much for the health and safety experts!

If you want to know who ruined our economic web, look no farther than the kids with the sticks: the socialists masquerading as scientists. The third pillar of the shutdown has fallen; a quick bounce back is highly unlikely; and even if one does occur, it will probably be an overexertion followed by a several months– to year-long depression. Whoever was advising President Trump on the economics of shutdown was apparently as knowledgeable of economics as the health and safety experts were of pandemics. Perhaps they were in cahoots to spread socialism?

Venezuela’s central bank has filed a legal claim in a commercial court in an effort to force the Bank of England to transfer £930mln ($1.13bln) of its gold, kept there, to fund the government’s COVID-19 response, reported Reuters citing a document submitted in a London court.

Dated 14 May, the claim reportedly says the Venezuelan central bank “seeks an order requiring the BoE to comply with the proposed instruction”.

Venezuela, which has been under coronavirus quarantine since March, hopes the gold's value will be transferred to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to subsequently be used for purchasing healthcare supplies, medicine, and food, says the outlet.

Venezuela so far has registered 749 coronavirus cases according to the Johns Hopkins University, with 10 deaths from the respiratory disease.

The government of Nicolas Maduro has been seeking to sell off some of the country’s gold reserves as a means of raising funds amid the current healthcare crisis and quarantine measures it has entailed.

The situation has been compounded by plummeting global oil prices and crippling US sanctions.

“The foot-dragging by the Bank of England is critically hampering Venezuela and the UN’s efforts to combat COVID-19 in the country,” Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing the central bank, was quoted by Reuters as saying.

There has not been any official response regarding the claim from either the Bank of England or the Venezuelan central bank.

The reported legal claim comes after a request made by Nicolas Maduro’s government in April to the Bank of England - which acts as a gold custodian for several developing nations - to sell off some of its gold reserves there and direct the funds to the UN so they might be used to aid Venezuela’s efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

The legal wrangling and has been dragging on for some time, as the Bank of England has refused to transfer some 31 tonnes of Venezuelan gold to the government of Nicolas Maduro, whom the UK has refused to recognise as the country’s legitimate leader since 2018, reports the outlet.

Venezuela has been in the grips of a political crisis since 2019, when US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself ""interim president"" and received the support of most of the Western countries, with the US and its allies shortly after starting to seize Venezuelan state assets abroad and imposing tough sanctions on the country’s companies.

On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers, was in Chicago at McCormick Place, where he’s in charge of putting up a massive field hospital for COVID-19 patients facing a different kind of catastrophe.

Traveling with his staff microbiologist, Semonite, 62, gave elbow bumps to those in the small group greeting him.

He’s overseeing nine such projects, with many more expected. On Wednesday, he was in Detroit. Then, he flew to Illinois to meet with Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a “phenomenal lady,” he said. Thursday morning, he toured McCormick Place before jumping on a small jet to visit another city.

Semonite said he’s prioritizing the Corps’ projects based on the rate of growth of the virus in each city and how many hospital beds are needed.

The numbers that tell the story: Our coronavirus data tracking On our Coronavirus Data page, you’ll find a collection of graphs, charts and maps tracing the spread of the virus, tracking test results and plotting the impact on individual counties. Check back daily for updated totals.

“At the end of the day, though, the single biggest reason why we would come to Chicago or somewhere else is that governor feels that there’s a very, very critical requirement,” Semonite said.

Pritzker is “very, very focused on being able to try to take care of this town,” Semonite said.

New York was the model for the Corps’ efforts after the Javits convention center was recently converted into a hospital for sick and injured people who aren’t infected with COVID-19. A Navy hospital ship is housing patients sent from Javits.

The Army Corps is building nine such projects across the country with a total of 9,500 beds, according to Semonite, who said he expects to sign contracts in the next two days for another eight projects with 4,000 more beds.

“We’ve looked at almost 600 different facilities,” he said.

About a week ago, Semonite said he was notified by the secretary of the Army that Pritzker was “very, very concerned about the bed shortage up here.”

A division commander, Major Gen. Mark Toy, then met with Pritzker, and construction was launched on the McCormick Place’“alternative care facility,” which is short of a full-blown hospital.

Three exhibition halls at the convention center are being converted into medical wings, one of which will have 500 beds ready to use Friday, Semonite said.

Another 2,500 beds will be installed in stages to meet what officials say could be a peak in coronavirus diagnoses in Chicago around mid-April. The buildout is being paid for with $15 million in federal emergency funding.

People with varying degrees of coronavirus complications will be housed in each of the three converted exhibition halls.

The state is in charge of staffing the facility with health-care professionals. Pritzker has said the state is asking for volunteers and hiring people from contracting services. He said enough workers have been hired to staff at least 500 beds.

Officials have said they also were working to create temporary bed capacity at the shuttered MetroSouth Hospital in Blue Island and the Elgin site where Sherman Hospital was before being demolished.

In Chicago, United Center is being used for food distribution, first-responder staging and collecting medical supplies.

Walsh Construction is building the infrastructure for the field hospital at Place.

Illinois National Guard troops are assembling the beds and other equipment.

Semonite said the project is based on one of four standard designs for retrofitting big spaces like convention centers, vacant hospitals, dorms and sports arenas. Seattle’s CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks play, also is being retrofitted.

The Chicago Sun-Times wasn’t allowed to tour the field hospital inside McCormick Place,, which Semonite described as a series of three-walled pods with a curtain at each opening. The metal-braced walls are the same ones vendors use during trade shows, he said. Each pod has a bed and chair. Nurses’ stations are in the corridors.

Oxygen is being pumped into the field hospital, and engineers in McCormick Place have calibrated the heat and air-conditioning system to provide “negative pressure” that keeps contaminants from escaping, Semonite said.

“I’ve got to admit the staff in some of these big facilities is amazing,” he said. “I met with the leadership of McCormick yesterday. They’re doing a lot of the work.”

Semonite said Walsh Construction is among contractors across the country who’ve been asking to help the Army Corps.

“This is not about trying to make a buck on a contract,” he said. “This is about taking care of the local citizens of this city, of this state, because these are all our people.

“President Trump said a couple of weeks ago, ‘This is when America really needs to rally to be able to come together.’ ”

Semonite said one of his biggest aims is to make it as easy as possible for cities and states to build such field hospitals quickly.

Semonite said the Army Corps’ response to the pandemic in some respects is more difficult than the other big challenges he’s been associated with in his more than 40-year military career, such as rebuilding communities after hurricanes swept through.

“When Mother Nature strikes, and even to a degree in combat operations, you have a pretty good understanding of what the set you’re going to inherit is when a hurricane comes,” he said. “It’s terrifying for 12 to 14 or 24 hours. But the next morning when you wake up, you kind of know what has to be built.

“And we kind of have defined the problem, and then we all attack. We don’t know where this one’s going to end. How long is this going to go? How long do facilities like this have to be run?

“This is an extremely complicated challenge,” he said. “And we are not going to be able to solve this with a complicated solution.”

At a news conference Thursday, Pritzker said he has toured the hospital being built at McCormick Place: “I didn’t know you could build something like that in five days.”

“You should all feel very, very proud of the work that’s been done so quickly,” Pritzker said, calling the carpenters, National Guardsmen and other workers at McCormick Place “patriotic.”

“They know they are doing something that’s going to save people’s lives.”

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama. https://t.co/ofKNYvrRKl — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 18, 2020

Sherman attempted to explain away the matter by suggesting that to unmask an American “caught” communicating with a foreign official of a hostile country is routine, even advisable. But the question frames the matter incorrectly. – READ MORE

Trump told his administration members while he was signing the order that it “gives you tremendous power to cut regulation.” The order pertains to “instructing federal agencies to use any and all authority to waive, suspend and eliminate unnecessary regulations that impede economic recovery.”

Trump made it clear when he signed the executive order that he hopes this regulatory relief becomes permanent.

Trump has made axing the administrative state, meaning the massive federal bureaucracy that strangles economic growth, a constant priority throughout his tenure in the White House.

Big League Politics has reported on how Trump’s deregulation push has driven liberals up the wall:

President Donald Trump has rolled out his new coal deregulation plan, and it is causing frantic liberals to claim it is the end of the world. Vanity Fair released a hyperbolic article about Trump’s common sense plan to let the states decide their own carbon emissions policies. The article claims that this federalist plan to abide by the Constitution would cause thousands of deaths as well as an increase in diseases. “We’re on the right side of history,” Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler said to the New York Times, infuriating liberals even further. What has liberals really spooked is the inevitable court challenges to Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy rule. They are worried that the Supreme Court, bolstered by two conservative justices appointed by Trump, could set a precedent making it very difficult for future presidents to ever address their much-ballyhooed climate crisis. While liberals complain about these new policies from their ivory towers, the Senators from West Virginia are happy about the changes made by President Trump that will help the blue collar workers in their state. “Our emissions are on a downward slope and have been without a Clean Power Plan, and we’re going to keep moving towards that way regardless of what regulation we have in order because we know it’s better for the environment and the health of people,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said. Even her Democratic counterpart has to admit that Trump’s policy is a step forward from the policies of his predecessor. “I never supported the CPP because it required coal plants to install emission controls that were not “commercially proven” at the time. It is unreasonable to ask power plants to utilize technologies that do not yet exist, and penalize them if they don’t. For this reason and others, the regulation became a subject of intense litigation causing further uncertainty for our power sector. While we are still reviewing the final rule and its implications, the rule does offer fossil plants greater compliance flexibility, which I support,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said.

While liberals use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to shred the Constitution and let dangerous criminals out of jail, Trump makes power moves that actually help the American people.",fake

One by one, women in homes across rural Zimbabwe had a pleading question: When would family planning services return?

Lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus’ spread have put millions of women in Africa, Asia and elsewhere out of reach of birth control and other sexual and reproductive health needs. Confined to their homes with their husbands and others, they face unwanted pregnancies and little idea of when they can reach the outside world again.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

In these uncertain times, women “have to lock down their uterus,” Abebe Shibru, Zimbabwe country director for Marie Stopes International, told The Associated Press. “But there is no way in a rural area.”

Eighteen countries in Africa have imposed national lockdowns, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All but essential workers or those seeking food or health care must stay home for weeks, maybe longer. Rwanda, the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to impose a lockdown, has extended it for two weeks, a possible sign of things to come.

Even where family planning remains available, providers say many women fear venturing out and being beaten by security forces and accused of defying the new restrictions. Meanwhile, outreach services, the key to reaching rural women, have largely stopped to avoid drawing crowds and the risk of workers spreading the virus from one community to another.

The International Planned Parenthood Federation, or IPPF, in a new report Thursday says more than one in five member clinics around the world have closed because of the pandemic and related restrictions. More than 5,000 mobile clinics across 64 countries have closed. Most are in South Asia and Africa, but Latin America and Europe have seen hundreds of closures as well.

From Pakistan to Germany to Colombia, IPPF members say they have scaled down HIV testing and gender-based violence response work and face shortages of contraceptives.

“They have needs that cannot wait,” IPPF director-general Alvaro Bermejo said of women in a statement, pleading for help from national governments to help provide personal protective equipment to allow for intimate care.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and death.

In Europe, 100 non-governmental groups on Wednesday called on governments to ensure reproductive health services during the pandemic, saying many facilities have sharply reduced them or shut down. The French government last month said pharmacies can deliver contraceptive pills to women unable to renew prescriptions under lockdown.

The predicted baby boom in Africa alone, even as birth rates have dropped in many countries as more girls are educated, will add to the growth that already is projected to see the continent of 1.3 billion people double in population by 2050.

In Zimbabwe, Marie Stopes provided more than 400,000 women last year with family planning services, Shibru said, including averting nearly 50,000 unsafe abortions. But now the organization’s outreach services, which reach more than 60% of clients, are suspended. Even at clinics that remain open, the number of clients has dropped by 70%.

That leaves a country of men, no longer free to work in the fields or elsewhere, and without the distraction of sports, confined with their wives for weeks on end.

“Husband and wife, what else can they be doing in that house?” asked Future Gwena, a Marie Stopes outreach worker. “I think we’re going to have a lot of pregnancies and, unfortunately, unintended. And most will result in unsafe abortions, domestic violence. Our community is paternalistic. If something goes wrong in the home, it’s the mother’s fault, even if the man initiated it.”

Even in normal times, the average woman seeking contraception must get consent from her husband, Shibru said.

Meanwhile, travel restrictions and manufacturing slowdowns in Asia as a result of the pandemic mean that some family planning providers are waiting for shipments of emergency contraceptives and other items as stocks run short at home.

“Today I expected a shipment from Asia, but it’s suspended,” Shibru said. “I don’t know how to fill that gap. It was supposed to come today to serve us for the coming six months. So this is one of the tragedies. ... We’re expecting a huge shortage of contraceptives in African countries. Absolutely, condoms also.”

In Uganda, Marie Stopes country director Carole Sekimpi said they don’t know when a shipment of emergency contraceptives will arrive because India, their source, has also locked down. They’ve been out of stock for a month and need oral contraceptive pills as well, she said.

“Yesterday when I heard (neighboring) Kenya talking about a lockdown in Nairobi and (the port of) Mombasa I thought, ‘My god, what’s going to happen to all of our shipments?’” she said. “Overall, there’s definitely going to be a problem.”

She worried about the girls and women confined in homes with potential assailants, even uncles or cousins. Her organization has suspended outreach, which provides about 40% of services, and clinics that remain open have seen a drop in client traffic of about 20%.

“We don’t see you anymore,” anxious callers say. “What’s happening?”

Even the capital, Kampala, has been affected. Sekimpi said she visited a large government-run hospital there on Monday, “but when I got there my heart was broken because the one service suspended was family planning. With good reason, because it’s usually crowded.”

She expects not only a baby boom but a rise in unsafe abortions and post-abortion care, along with panicky women seeking to remove their IUD (intrauterine device) or birth control implant earlier than expected as they fear no family planning worker will be around to help them later.

Even the U.S. Embassy in Uganda has taken note of the challenges women face, tweeting that “Periods don’t pause for pandemics” and sharing advice on how to make washable sanitary pads at home.

The range of issues is similar across Africa, Shibru in Zimbabwe said, citing a daily call with country directors in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Madagascar and elsewhere.

“Look, everything has been diverted to COVID,” he said of the disease caused by the coronavirus. “But after COVID, another catastrophe will be women’s health, unless something is done right now.”",real

According to the newspaper, the London Evening Standard, the arrival of coronavirus testing kits, which were supposed to behave been allocated to clubs in the division has been delayed.

This means that the teams who lack the facilities to test players for the disease would not be able to comply with the necessary health and safety instructions stipulated by the so-called “Project Restart” plan, which aims to facilitate the resumption of matches by mid-June.

The Premier League has been suspended since March over fears that the coronavirus could pose a threat to the health and safety of players and fans alike, but the division’s administrators remain confident that play can get back underway, but many hurdles aside from the lack of testing kits still need to be overcome.

Talks between Premier League teams over the potential use of neutral grounds also remain in a deadlock, and a vote that was supposed to take place on the matter earlier this week has been postponed due to fears that it would be roundly rejected.

Professional football clubs throughout Europe have until the 25th of May to clarify their plans to the continent’s governing body, UEFA, but so far only the German Bundesliga looks certain to officially return to action.

If the Premier League cannot get its coronavirus testing infrastructure in place before June, and no consensus over the neutral venue issue can be found, then it is possible that the English top-flight season will have to be abruptly terminated.

Only a few options for concluding the campaign would then remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League.",fake

24/7 Wall Street

According to a study published in 2018 by the marketing blog Invesp about U.S. online grocery shopping statistics and trends, 48% of American food shoppers were already buying at least a portion of their groceries online, with that number expected to rise to 59% last year and to as much as 70% by 2022. The most important factors driving online food purchases were the fact that it saved time and was more convenient.

All this, remember, was before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It’s too early for comprehensive statistics on overall growth in the past few months, but according to data from the Nielsen and Rakuten Intelligence team, online sales of consumer packaged goods of the kinds typically sold in grocery stores increased 56% for the single week ending April 18 compared with the same period in 2019.

The limitations imposed by shelter-in-place orders, combined with concerns about in-person grocery shopping while the pandemic remains unchecked have obviously only increased demand for delivery. The major provider of grocery delivery, Instacart, for instance, saw its business more than double between this February and March. (Walmart and Amazon recorded higher delivery volume, but not exclusively of groceries.) The company delivers from many of the best grocery store chains in every state.

Shopping for our food and sundry household items has been a part of our lives for so long that it’s hard for some of us to imagine handing the chore over completely to somebody else, even if we’ve taken advantage of shopping services for some of our needs in the past. But that’s the new reality – and there are advantages to online shopping.

For one thing, in addition to saving time and eliminating the need for a trip to the market, online shopping often provides a wider selection of products.

In addition, it might actually save you money, even taking into consideration delivery fees and driver tips: Whether you realize it or not, you probably used to spend a portion of your weekly grocery budget on impulse buys. Supermarket layouts are designed to encourage unplanned purchases. If you're ordering groceries to be delivered, there's much less opportunity to pick up something you may or may not need on the spur of the moment.

1. Keep a running grocery list

Just because you're not going to the store yourself doesn't mean you shouldn't make a list. If you just go onto a store's site and start picking things out, you'll end up impulse-buying after all.

2. Do an inventory of what you have on hand

Before you place a grocery order, double-check your freezer and your pantry cupboards, and make sure you're not reordering things you've already got in sufficient quantity. (If you're ordering food that needs to be frozen, it's also important to make sure you'll have room in the freezer.)

3. Be specific

To help your surrogate shopper pick out exactly what you want, be as specific as possible. Don't just say ""a head of lettuce"" if you specifically want iceberg or romaine. And speaking of romaine, ""a bag of romaine"" could mean whole baby romaine leaves, chopped larger leaves, or one of those hearts-of-romaine bags holding three heads.

4. Attach a photo to your order

This won't be possible if you're using Instacart or some other online service or ordering directly from a grocery store. If an independent surrogate shopper is fulfilling your order, however, and you want a specific brand or flavor of some packaged food or some uncommon variety of produce, it's useful to attach an image of exactly what you want.

5. Consider substitutions

If there are no more blocks of Swiss cheese in the dairy case, will Jarlsberg do? If the chicken noodle soup is all gone, how about chicken and rice? Supermarket sites usually give you the option to accept substitutes if your exact order isn't available. If you're using an individual surrogate shopper, let him or her know whether or not alternatives are okay – and if so, what the parameters are (""any flavor except habanero"").

6. Don't order too little

If you regularly use items with long shelf lives – like certain brands of breakfast cereal, canned chili, peanut butter, or dried pasta – buy several at a time to cut down on the size of future orders.

7. Don't over-order

On the other hand, both to avoid wasting food that might go bad before you eat it and to show consideration for other shoppers, don't buy more that you'll be able to use within a reasonable period of time. Buying three boxes of Cheerios at a time is foresight; buying a dozen is hoarding.

Saving money during COVID-19 pandemic:Some stores aren't accepting coupons, but there are still ways to save

8. Don't forget the toiletries and over-the-counter medications

Most supermarkets carry ample selections of personal grooming items, medicine-cabinet essentials (adhesive bandages, for instance), vitamins, and non-prescription medicines like antacids, pain relievers, and allergy pills. Including these in your grocery order will save you a trip to the drug store.

9. Plan ahead

Grocery delivery services, whether large-scale operations or independents, are facing huge demand right now, and might not always be able to fill orders in a timely manner. In some cases, you may have to book a delivery a week or more in advance, but at the very least expect to have to wait two or three days between submitting your order and receiving your groceries.

10. Tip generously

Even with safety measures in place, shopping for and delivering groceries can be a risky pursuit, and the people who are doing it are putting their own well-being on the line to perform a vital service. Be generous, showing your appreciation for them by tipping at least 10% of the grocery total (more if you can afford it), even if there's already a service charge.

11. Expect some disappointments

Even if you're specific about what you want and what substitutions you'll accept, sometimes there are omissions or mix-ups. They're rarely catastrophic. Unless they're really essential, in which case your shopper or shopping service should be able to correct the error, just add them to your next shopping list.

12. Clean or disinfect your groceries

While some experts say it isn't necessary to clean packaging or produce when you've unpacked it, it's safe to assume that anything that's been on the shelves or in the produce bins at the market has been touched by numerous people. To be especially safe, then, disinfect packages with antiseptic spray or wipes or soap and water. Don't use either directly on produce, though; just a thorough washing with warm water is enough.

1043,141,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/health/coronavirus-mail-packages.html,2020-03-24,You’ve Got Mail. Will You Get the Coronavirus?,"
Scientists agree that the main means by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumps from an infected person to its next host is by hitching a ride in the tiny droplets that are sprayed into the air with each cough or sneeze. But with deliveries now at holiday levels as locked-down Americans shop online rather than in person, the question remains: Can you catch the coronavirus from the parcels and packages your overburdened mail carrier keeps leaving at your door?
The first formal process for curbing the spread of infection by detaining travelers from an affected region until their health was proved was instituted in what is now Dubrovnik, Croatia, in 1377, against the bubonic plague. (This temporal buffer was originally 30 days, but when that proved too short, it was extended to 40 days, or quaranta giorni, from which we derive the word “quarantine.”)
Mail disinfection soon followed, as the then Republic of Venice extended and formalized the quarantine process to include cargo. Items that were considered particularly susceptible, including textiles and letters, were also subject to fumigation: dipped in or sprinkled with vinegar, then often exposed to smoke from aromatic substances, from rosemary to, in later years, chlorine. Once the items were treated, a distinctive wax seal or cancellation was usually applied to them, so the recipient would know where and when the disinfection had been carried out. (Such marks often provide the only remaining evidence of the ebb and flow of disease; some minor outbreaks of plague or typhus in remote areas of medieval Europe, for example, would have been lost to history without their postal traces.)
The diseases changed, but for centuries mail disinfection techniques remained largely the same. As recently as 1900, during a plague outbreak in Honolulu, letters were routinely disinfected by clipping off the two opposite corners of each envelope and then spreading a batch of mail out in an airtight room filled with sulfur fumes for three hours.
A representative for the U.S. Postal Service was unwilling to discuss current sanitization protocols. But the agency’s website reports that the only mail items receiving treatment are letters and parcels sent to ZIP codes beginning in 202, 203, 204 and 205, which serve federal government agencies in Washington, D.C. In a process that began shortly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Postal Service sends mail destined for those ZIP codes to New Jersey, where they are put on a conveyor belt and passed under a high-energy beam of ionizing radiation that kills bacteria and viruses. The letters and packages are then “aired out” for a while, before being forwarded to their destinations. The paper is left slightly faded and somewhat crispy, but sterile.
Should mail irradiation be extended beyond these exclusive ZIP codes, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus? On CBS News’s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be transmitted by contaminated objects. “This is a sticky virus,” he said. The structure of the coronavirus’s protective envelope helps it bond tightly to certain surfaces: skin in particular, as well as fabric and wood, but also plastic and steel.
Some government agencies seem concerned that all of that circulating paper might be a potential vector. In early February, when COVID-19 was still just “the coronavirus” — and, for most Americans, still someone else’s problem — China’s central bank announced that it would quarantine the country’s cash, to prevent the disease from spreading from one person to another on money. The government collected bank notes from Hubei, the worst-hit province, and then sanitized the stacks of bills, either by baking them at a high temperature or bathing them in ultraviolet rays. The newly laundered cash was then kept in isolation for seven to 14 days before being rereleased into the banking system.
A few weeks later, the U.S. Federal Reserve began quarantining dollar bills repatriated from Asia, holding them for seven to 10 days before allowing them to re-enter the domestic financial system. Bank notes are made of cotton pulp, not wood fiber, but still: Why sanitize money and not mail?
Representatives of the big three package deliverers in the United States — U.P.S., FedEx and the Postal Service — insisted there is no need. “The C.D.C. has advised that there is a low risk of transmission on packages,” said Matthew O’Connor, a spokesman for U.P.S. FedEx, in a statement, said: “The guidance from the W.H.O. is that the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low, and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, traveled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”
David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, noted that the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, along with the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, has “indicated that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail.”
This is because many scientists think it is quite unlikely that you can catch the coronavirus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and subsequently touching your own mouth or nose. (One review of scientific publications on the subject concluded that hand washing seems to cut the risk of respiratory infection by a mere 16 percent — but added that the studies examined were of poor quality and more research was urgently needed.)
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment — Germany’s equivalent of the F.D.A. — advises that while the virus could, theoretically, be transmitted through this kind of “smear” infection, as opposed to the standard “droplet” infection, there have been no known cases in which individuals have caught the coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then transferring the virus to their mouth or nose. Then again, contact transmission is notoriously difficult to study and document.
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week shed more light on the subject. A group of researchers from the National Institutes of Health, the C.D.C., Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, misted virus particles into a rotating drum and studied how long the floating particles survived on various surfaces. They found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus survived for up to 24 hours on cardboard — three times longer than its cousin, the original SARS.
“In that light, you might expect the virus to remain viable for hours but probably not days on mail,” said James Lloyd-Smith, one of the study’s authors. “But there are important caveats.”
Among these: The study specifically looked at aerosolized virus particles, rather than the fine droplets that infected people emit with each cough or sneeze. The line between aerosols and droplets is fuzzy, but, broadly, droplets are bigger and settle more quickly, while aerosols are smaller and float for longer.
“Little is known about the rate at which infected people generate such aerosolized viruses,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said, although some medical procedures — including intubation to assist with breathing — are known to create aerosols. In addition, the experiment was designed to simulate indoor air; viruses like this one are expected to be stable for longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.
In an experiment that might better mimic the effect of sneezing on a letter, researchers from Hong Kong University pipetted droplets of SARS-CoV-2 onto various surfaces. Their results, which have not yet been peer reviewed and do not include details on temperature and humidity conditions, found no infectious virus left on paper after three hours — although, alarmingly, a significant level could be detected on the outer layer of a surgical mask after seven days.
“The bottom line is that there is some hypothetical risk of viable viruses surviving on mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said. “But given the time periods involved, this seems like a pretty minimal risk to the general public.”
Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University who studies the interaction of pathogens and surfaces, agreed that although the virus can persist on packages, these have not been identified as a risk factor for transmission. Nonetheless, he said, “I’d just wash my hands after handling,” rather than spray with Lysol or wipe with bleach. “I want to preserve the good sanitizers for risky things, and hand washing works just as well as spraying.”
For the delivery workers pulling 12-hour shifts to keep up with demand, and struggling to access the sanitizing supplies and hand-washing facilities they need, the situation is potentially riskier. “I would be more worried about the mail sorters and mail carriers, who are exposed to many more pieces of mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said.
Delivery is deemed an “essential function” by the Department of Homeland Security, and the volume of packages is expected only to increase as more Americans are required to shelter in place. Irradiating all mail is both overkill and likely impossible, given the volumes in question and the resources required. But making sure that the people who are keeping mail moving during this pandemic are protected also seems essential, not to mention ethical.
“The safety and well-being of U.S. Postal Service employees and customers is our highest priority,” said Mr. Partenheimer, who added that the agency is closely monitoring the situation to implement C.D.C. and public health department advice.",real
1045,1841,https://theduran.com/why-did-european-leaders-approval-ratings-rise-during-lockdown/,2020-05-22,Why did European leaders’ approval ratings rise during lockdown?,"European leaders have enjoyed higher poll numbers during the coronavirus pandemic despite having some of the highest COVID-19 deaths per capita in the world.

Latest polling data shows governing parties in the UK, Germany, Italy and France have had a popularity boost during national lockdowns.

“This is the most serious crisis that has hit Europe since the Second World War,” said Daniele Albertazzi, a political scientist from the University of Birmingham.

“It is quite well-known that in times of crisis, people do tend to rally behind the flag and the government of the day.”

Some European governments’ use of wartime metaphors could also have helped them to avoid scrutiny and maintain their popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic by convincing people they needed to come together to defeat the virus.

“Governments have been very shrewd and clever in exploiting this and using metaphors that remind people of war-time periods, so the virus has become an enemy that the population has to defeat by pulling together.”

“Right now people on the streets are saying that this is not the moment to have a go at the government.”

Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent, said that during moments of crisis “voters tend to rally around their incumbents”.

“This is especially likely to occur when voters face a big external ‘threat’, like terrorism and now a pandemic. I think the wartime rhetoric encouraged this, but we would most likely have seen a rally effect regardless,” Goodwin said.

Boris boost?

According to Opinium, the popularity of the UK’s ruling Conservative Party jumped from a 49% share before the lockdown was introduced, to 54 per cent afterwards. The main opposition Labour Party saw its figures drop by 4 per cent over the same period.

The Conservative Party’s leap in popularity could be explained by the rallying around the flag effect detailed by Albertazzi and Goodwin.

But it could also be linked to sympathy towards UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with COVID-19 on April 5 — around the time the party’s fortunes peaked — and later spent time in intensive care.

Speaking in mid-March, Johnson said of COVID-19: “This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world.

“I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance.

“That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since world war two.

“We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy.”

Macron and Merkel make gains

Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron’s ratings improved by an average of 10% after the country imposed a national lockdown on March 17.

The numbers have fallen over the course of the lockdown, but Macron still enjoys marginally higher ratings than before the COVID-19 pandemic.

During his speech to impose lockdown, Macron repeatedly used the phrase “nous sommes en guerre (“We are at war”).

But the most noticeable increase in support for the government is in Germany, where the CDU/CSU of Angela Merkel has risen, since the start of March, from a 24% to a 38% vote share.

Meanwhile, no other major political party in Germany has seen an increase in ratings, and Die Grunen (Greens) have fallen 7%, according to the survey institute, Kantar Emnid.

How did leaders in Italy and Spain fare?

Support for Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has also increased, while the ruling social democratic parties in Denmark, Sweden and Portugal had all improved by at least 4% in opinion polls by the end of March.

In Spain, public opinion in Pedro Sanchez’s Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) fell in the week before the national lockdown was introduced on the March 14, but has since slowly improved in April, according to ElectoPanel.

PSOE’s coalition partner Unidad Podemos has nevertheless seen a slight fall in opinion, but support has been steadily growing each week for Pablo Casado’s Partido Popular.

Will it last?

Analysts are suggesting these good numbers for governments will not sustain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

This “rally effect” of public support for incumbents “does now seem to be tailing off as voters begin to question their governments,” said Goodwin.

“Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, for example, are now suffering in the polls more than they were at the start of the crisis. This is important because we know that perceptions of competence -is a leader competently managing an important issue?- are very important to how people vote,” Goodwin added.

“You can see in countries like Italy, Switzerland, and Finland that there has been a short period of truce between governments and opposition or more radical and more moderate parties,” said Albertazzi.

“As weeks go past, people will start realising the enormous financial effect of the crisis and more and more stories emerge about the mishandling of the pandemic and the big mistakes that were made by governments”.

Populists fall but will return soon

Europe Elects data has also shown that a number of populist parties across Europe have fallen in opinion polls.

Matteo Salvini’s Lega Nord has fallen by roughly 4% since February, while VOX España, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and Marine le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France also suffered a decrease.

“Radical and populist parties seemed to have initially accepted that they needed to tone down their criticisms of governments or their opponents,” Albertazzi told Euronews.

But analysts do expect that populists will resume their communications soon, even though there are significant risks.

“It is easy to have a go at governments, opponents or the European Union,” said Albertazzi. “But there is certainly a risk that populists might jump on the bandwagon of criticism too early and misjudge the mood of the public.”

“This is a crisis of such huge proportions that we may still be in the stage where the public and business associations want to see more unity and division.”

But Albertazzi also noted that it is politically important for populist parties to change their stance as soon as possible.

“They have to demonstrate that they have remained fundamentally different from what they see as traditional parties, which they accuse of sticking to the same recipes.

“It is important that the voting public can see populists and radicals as something different, who are not taming their communications strategy.”

“When the immediate crisis passes and politics returns to some sense of normality, politicians are going to have to deal with the hangover,” said Euronews’ political editor Darren McCaffrey.

“More questions will be asked about how they dealt with the health crisis and how exactly they can help their economies bounce back while trying to get public finances in order.”

1052,358,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/business/retiring-social-security-jobs-coronavirus-pandemic.html,2020-04-17,Taking Social Security in the Pandemic: What to Know,"
The trend has been moving in a positive direction: Over the past decade, far more workers who are eligible for Social Security have been waiting to file, often substantially increasing their lifetime annual benefits.
But the stunning job losses in the pandemic-induced economic crisis could bring this trend to a crashing halt, as suddenly unemployed older workers without substantial savings scramble to meet living expenses.
At a time when fewer retired households can rely on traditional pensions and only about half own retirement accounts, Social Security is the most important benefit for most Americans. Even in good times, there is no simple, one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to timing a claim — your longevity, savings and any other pension income are important factors.
Now the decision is complicated by the highly uncertain outlook for the economy, jobs and financial markets. But even if you need Social Security income immediately, you may have options worth considering that can boost lifetime benefits.
Let’s review the pros and cons of different strategies for claiming benefits during the coronavirus pandemic.
I need income now. Why wait to claim Social Security?Your claiming age matters a great deal. You can file as early as 62, but your annual benefit will be higher for every year you wait, until 70.
Social Security uses an actuarial formula tied to your full retirement age — the point at which you can claim 100 percent of the benefit you’ve earned over the course of your working life. For example, if you turn 62 this year, your full retirement age is 66 and 8 months.
If you file before your full age, your benefit will be reduced as much as 6.7 percent annually, depending on when you claim. The bite is bigger than in the past because of changes enacted in 1983, when a gradual increase in the full retirement age from 65 to 67 was set in motion. Those increases, which still are being phased in, effectively set the bar higher for claiming a full benefit.
Filing at 62 this year means you’ll receive 72 percent of your full benefit, noted Richard W. Johnson, director of the program on retirement policy at the Urban Institute, compared with 80 percent for someone who was born in 1937 or earlier and retired at that age (when the full age was still 65).
“That lower income can really sting when you reach your 80s and out-of-pocket medical expenses and spending on home and residential care often surge,” Mr. Johnson said.
Filing after your full retirement age yields an even larger increase: 8 percent for every 12 months of delay up to age 70. That’s a much higher guaranteed return than you could get in any financial instrument, and benefits are adjusted annually for inflation.
Even a delay of a year or two past the full age can meaningfully increase benefits and mitigate your risk of falling short of income in retirement.
“Delaying your Social Security claim is the optimal strategy for anyone who is reasonably healthy and likely to live beyond the average longevity of an American,” said Michael Finke, a professor at the American College of Financial Services.
During the 2008 recession, early claiming jumped as large numbers of workers were forced to retire, Mr. Johnson said. But the trend has shifted decisively since then: For example, the share of people claiming at 62 fell to 35 percent in 2018 from 53 percent in 2009.
That positive trend now seems likely to stall or even reverse, Mr. Johnson said.“A lot of older people losing jobs now are going to be unemployed for a long time, and my fear is that many of them are never going to work again,” he said. “They’re going to end up taking Social Security and dipping into their retirement accounts earlier than expected, and that is going to have serious consequences for their economic security at age 70 and 80.”
I have some savings. Should I live on that rather than claim Social Security now?This is a very personal decision that depends greatly on your circumstances. Maintaining an emergency fund is always important, and never more so than during times of economic volatility. But people with very substantial savings can draw down safely to cover living expenses while delaying their claim.
The loss of earned income means you will be in a lower tax bracket, and rates are at historically low levels under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
“There’s no better time to take money out of a 401(k) or I.R.A. than when your income is relatively low and you have a lower marginal tax rate,” Mr. Finke said.
A delay of just a few years can be very beneficial. A 62-year-old with a full retirement age benefit of $1,500 would increase her likely lifetime benefits by more than $100,000 by waiting until that point to file, according to a projection by William Meyer, a co-founder of Social Security Solutions, which offers software aimed at helping retirees make optimal claiming decisions. Mr. Meyer’s calculation assumes that our retiree lives to 90 and that Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustment is 2 percent each year.
But the pandemic has added a new dimension to claiming decisions for most retirees, the retirement researcher Dirk Cotton said. Since most Americans have modest savings, if any, many of them will need to hang on to what they have.
“I know that I can either get Social Security income now, or shift some of it to the future if I think I might need it more later than I do today,” he said. “But the question now is whether the pandemic has changed our thinking enough about the future to affect that decision, and the answer is, ‘Absolutely, yes.’”
For example, the future economic security of adult children might favor an early Social Security claim over drawing down savings now, Mr. Cotton argued.
“What if your children have jobs that now are gone or hanging by a thread?” he asked. “You’re going to want to have assets available to help them.”
Persistent bear market conditions also present an argument in favor of an early claim, Mr. Cotton added.
“Can you count on your portfolio to generate the kind of income you had expected earlier?” he asked. “If the market is dropping, you may have to sell off more of your portfolio each year than you had expected, but claiming early Social Security would relieve some of that pressure.”
I don’t have anything saved. What should I do?Your options are limited here, but there are moves that may get some Social Security income flowing now while preserving the possibility of higher benefits later.
One strategy is to claim benefits now but suspend them later to accumulate what are known as delayed retirement credits. Let’s say our out-of-work 62-year-old claimant finds a new job at 64. When she reaches her full retirement age, she could suspend her benefits and begin accruing delayed credits, calculated from her already reduced benefit. Doing so would add roughly $50,000 to her lifetime benefit, Mr. Meyer said. And if she waits until 63 to make her initial filing and then executes this suspend strategy, the addition to her likely lifetime payout will rise to about $71,000.
“You can only suspend once, but it does add an element of flexibility that can result in more cumulative benefits,” Mr. Meyer said.
People who gain new employment while receiving Social Security should be aware of one complication here. It’s called the retirement earnings test.
If you claim benefits before your full retirement age and keep working, Social Security withholds a portion of your benefits if your earnings exceed certain amounts, a figure known as the exempt amount. (For 2020, the exempt amount is $18,240; for people attaining full retirement this year, the exempt amount is $48,600, applied only to earnings in months before the month of full retirement age attainment.)
Social Security withholds $1 in benefits for every $2 of earnings in excess of the exempt amount. But the reduced benefits are not lost permanently. When you reach your full retirement age, your monthly benefit will be increased permanently to account for the months when benefits were withheld.
Married couples have an important additional option for increasing their household benefit: One spouse claims early while the other delays. Consider a couple in which one spouse is 66 and the other 63. The older spouse has a full retirement benefit of $2,400, and the younger spouse can expect a full benefit of $1,500.
Mr. Meyer calculates that if both file now rather than at full retirement age, they forgo as much at $59,000 in lifetime benefits, and $275,000 compared with delaying to age 70. If the younger, lower-earning spouse is laid off and starts benefits now but the older, higher-earning spouse delays starting benefits until 70, they will have $170,000 more in benefits than if they both start benefits right away.
How does my longevity figure into this?This question underscores an important caveat accompanying Mr. Meyer’s projections, which assume a life span to 90: Not only may your mileage vary — it certainly will. Financial advisers routinely illustrate outcomes assuming long life spans as a way to test the retirement plans they draw up.
Men who reach 65 have a 33 percent chance of living to 90, and women a 44 percent chance, according to the Society of Actuaries. And for married couples, there’s a 63 percent chance that one spouse will live to at least 90. Yet a recent study by the society found that half of us wrongly estimate our life expectancy by five or more years, with 23 percent overestimating and 28 percent underestimating.
Those numbers illustrate the classic argument for Social Security’s value as insurance against outliving our financial resources. But the challenges of the pandemic economy may turn that argument on its head.
“Sometimes an economic analysis points to what seems like a good decision for a large group of people,” Mr. Cotton said. “Economics can tell you what’s best for an entire group of people — but you’re one person. It’s something you need to decide on your own.”
How do I determine my benefit amount and file?If you have an account on the Social Security website, you can download your personal statement of benefits, which includes your estimated benefit amount at various ages. The statement also includes your lifetime wage history; check this to make sure it looks accurate. If you haven’t established an account yet, you can do that at any time; it’s useful to have one, since Social Security mails out paper statements only periodically these days.
The Social Security field offices are closed to the public for most routine transactions during the pandemic. If you want to claim benefits now, filing online will be your most convenient option. Services are also available via the agency’s toll-free line, 800-772-1213, but be prepared for long delays.",real
1053,1109,https://www.businessinsider.com/pause-bill-payments-if-you-lost-work-due-to-coronavirus,2020-05-15,"If you've been financially impacted by the coronavirus, you may be able to pause payments on these 8 bills","Many companies understand Americans are losing work due to the coronavirus and are struggling to pay their bills.

If you've been financially affected by the coronavirus, you can ask companies about their policies regarding late or missed payments.

Some companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus.

You might be able to pause payments toward memberships, credit cards, utilities, insurance, rent, mortgage, auto loans, and federal and private student loans.

Read more personal finance coverage.

Many employees are out of work or facing reduced hours as US businesses temporarily close to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Lenders are empathizing with people who are struggling to pay their bills during the pandemic.

If you reach out to companies, you may be able to pause any of these eight bills — and make life a little less stressful during the outbreak.

1. Memberships and subscriptions

It may seem like we're beating a dead horse by recommending you cancel memberships and subscriptions to save money. But while people might normally tell you to cut out frivolous expenses like streaming services, that's not necessarily the best move here.

After all, you're going to be spending a lot of time at home. Is now really the time to delete your Netflix account?

Instead, think about expenses that will no longer be relevant while you're self-isolating. If your gym is closed indefinitely, pause your monthly payments. If you're a season ticket holder to an amusement park that has closed or for a sports team whose season has been canceled, call the ticket office to discuss cancellation.

In some cases, you may want to ask whether you can pause rather than cancel a membership. For example, if you cancel your gym membership, you might have to pay the joining fee again when you finally go back. Hopefully, pausing payments eliminate that extra expense.

2. Credit card payments

No one wants to miss a credit card payment. Neglecting to make a minimum payment on time can hurt your credit score. When you fail to pay off the full statement balance every month, you have to pay interest.

Thankfully, many credit card issuers are making accommodations for borrowers who have been financially affected by the coronavirus. Companies are encouraging these members to contact a representative to discuss their options. Some issuers are allowing people to skip payments without accruing interest.

3. Utilities

Companies such as CenterPoint Energy, Xcel Energy, and Minnesota Power have announced they won't shut off customers' power if they're unable to pay at this time.

Charter is installing free WiFi and Broadband for new customers, and it will remain free for 60 days. Arvig is offering free internet and WiFi to new customers who have K-12 or college students in their households. These customers won't have to pay until schools reopen.

Check whether your utility company has already announced exceptions for payments online. If so, call up the company to tell them about your situation. You can still give them a call if you can't find any information about special circumstances online. It's possible they're still willing to work with you.

4. Federal student loan payments

Under the CARES Act, federal student loan payments are suspended until September 30, 2020. No interest accrues during this time. You won't be penalized for skipping these payments, and your credit score won't be affected.

The CARES Act is referring to Direct federal student loans that are owned by the Department of Education. Private loans, refinanced loans, and FFEL and Perkins loans owned by private companies or colleges do not qualify for forbearance under the CARES Act.

The Department of Education has paused all federal student loan payments, so any automatic payments will be suspended. If you'd like to continue making payments until September 30 to eliminate debt more quickly, call your student loan servicer to reinstate automatic payments.

If you're enrolled in a student loan forgiveness program but skip payments until September 30, these months will still count toward your required number of payments to receive forgiveness, even if you don't pay anything. In order for these months to count toward your PSLF credits, you must still be employed full-time during this period.

If you've made a federal student loan payment since March 13, you can contact your servicer to request a refund.

5. Private student loan payments

Many private student loan companies are encouraging borrowers to contact representatives to discuss payment options. Some are making exceptions for people who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.

Some lenders already have policies in place to accommodate borrowers who are out of work. For example, Wells Fargo's Loan Modification Program lowers your monthly payments. It also offers short-term payment relief, which lasts for two months. Most lenders also offer forbearance, although terms vary.

6. Insurance payments

Several big-name insurance companies are making exceptions for people who have been impacted by the coronavirus. For example, Liberty is offering auto insurance customers 15% refunds on two months of premiums, and GEICO will no longer cancel your coverage if you miss payments or allow your policy to expire through May 31.

Call your insurance providers to ask whether they're willing to accommodate your situation. Even just pausing payments for a month or two may help alleviate your financial burden.

7. Rent or Mortgage Payments

Numerous cities have temporarily forbidden landlords from evicting tenants who can't pay rent. Whether your city has released an official stance on evictions or not, contact your landlord to discuss your job loss. You might be able to set up a payment plan or defer payment for a month or two.

For homeowners, federal mortgage lending companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are offering forbearance for up to 12 months, and beginning July 1, you can request to put off repayment until you sell, refinance, or pay off the home completely.

Some private lenders are allowing forbearance for up to 120 days. Contact your lender and be prepared to show proof of economic hardship.

8. Auto payments

Many lenders are working with people who have lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus and struggling to make car loan payments. Ally Bank is offering auto payment deferment for up to 120 days.

Some car manufacturers are extending a hand to borrowers, too. For example, Hyundai's finance team is allowing current car owners to defer payments for up to three months.

Call your lender to explain your situation and talk about your options.",real
1076,1838,https://humansarefree.com/2020/05/who-admits-vaccines-dont-work-against-coronavirus.html,2020-05-22,WHO Inadvertently Admits That Vaccines Won’t Work Against Coronavirus,"In trying to keep the pandemic going for as long as possible, it would seem, the World Health Organization (WHO) is insistent that developing natural immunity to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) may not be possible, and that society’s only hope is a vaccine.

But if natural immunity is out of the question, then why would vaccine-induced immunity be any better?

With roughly 310,000 confirmed deaths worldwide, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to dominate news headlines, especially now that the Trump administration is getting the ball rolling on developing and releasing a fast-tracked vaccine.

But nobody seems to be addressing the fact that if our own natural immune systems cannot fight the thing, then there is no way a vaccine will do anything other than needlessly cause adverse effects.

In a recent announcement, the WHO stated that there is no solid proof to suggest that people who test positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and recover develop natural immunity.

They could still get re-infected again, the United Nations (UN) body insists – even as it continues to ignore the fact that a strain-specific vaccine would theoretically provide even less protection than natural immunity, if this is the case.

“There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from #COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” the WHO wrote in a statement.

It’s about making you obedient, not safe

The reason why the WHO is making a point of emphasizing the questionable immunity that comes following a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection is that the globalist entity does not want people refusing to following “safety guidelines” like mask-wearing and physical distancing.

“People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,” the WHO laments.

Should a vaccine ever become available, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wants it to be distributed for “free” to everyone – meaning taxpayers will collectively foot the bill through their governments.

This is great news for billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates, whose own vaccine development endeavors are almost guaranteed to reap windfall profits if “free” Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines eventually become a thing.

The way that Gates, the WHO, and other pandemic extremists plan to keep the public strung along in anticipation of a magical “unicorn” vaccine is to continue fear-mongering about the threat of infection.

One of the latest claims is that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away, which is sure to scare enough people into demanding whatever “warp speed” drug, injectable or otherwise, is presented as the cure.

“It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” stated Dr. Mike Ryan, the “emergencies director” of the WHO, during a recent virtual press conference.

Ryan then went on to compare the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to HIV, stating that “HIV has not gone away, but we have come to terms with the virus,” adding that he does not believe that “anyone can predict when this disease will disappear.”

Unbelievably, there are some 100 potential vaccine candidates for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) currently in development.

But this means nothing in terms of the continued spread of the disease, assuming any of these vaccines even work, because there are already vaccines for other health conditions like the measles that have not been eradicated.

1086,40,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/official-statement-china-recommended-treatment-covid-19/,2020-03-05,Official Statement From China For Recommended Treatment Of COVID-19 Using Vitamin C,"Confirming the reports from small independent studies and 3 clinical trials, a Shanghai hospital has announced a recommendation to use high dose intravenous treatment of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, according to the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service.

The announced official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C come as welcomed news as the virus continues to spread. The dosage recommendation will vary with the severity of illness ranging from 50-200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 16,000 mg/kg/day.

*Note: ""Using Vitamin C"" was added to the title on April, 13, 2020.

The doses are ranging from approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mgs for an adult which is administered by an IV. Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD who is President of the Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy states that this specific method of administration is very important because vitamin C’s effects are at least 10 times more powerful when taken by IV rather than orally, and that “Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.”

Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD is the associate director for the clinical trials. We are proud to say that Dr. Cheng is a Fellow and board certified anti-aging physician by the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) as well as being a Fellow and board certified A4M Integrative Cancer Therapy. Dr. Cheng has been working closely with medical and government authorities through China and has been instrumental in facilitating at least 3 of the clinical IV vitamin C studies in China. Despite most of his work being sensored and blocked by most media Dr. Cheng has been trying to bring this information to the public and will continue his efforts to encourage more hospitals to implement IV vitamin C therapy along with high doses of oral vitamin C as well. Additionally, both Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19.

Comments from Dr. Cheng in February reads:

“Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”

“Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.

The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:

“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”

The protocol from the Chinese government can be read here, they are not blocking this news.

Then why are we not hearing more about this on the news when you can find it published online in many places, it does make one wonder. But this can be corrected at any time by people sharing the news, we have included various links that will take you to the information including the clinical trials.

To be blunt not sharing or withholding information from the public of potential treatments should be seen as negligence. Vitamin C is not new, it is available, and has been proven and used as an antiviral since the 1930s(1). Vitamin C has been injected at high doses since the 1940s(2), and has been used for influenza, SARS, and viral pneumonia in the decades since then(3).

“At my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30,000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.” (Hyoungjoo Shin, M.D.)

“We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients’ lives first?” (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).

“We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic,” says Dr. Cheng.",fake

Caceres caught coronavirus and was in a coma for 11 days. Spencer Kimball | CNBC

Josue Caceres remembers waking up in a hospital bed. He tried to get up and go to the bathroom, but he was so weak he fell and hit his head.



When he woke up from the fall, the doctor told him he had caught Covid-19, had gone into a coma for 11 days and was placed on a ventilator. Although his family has a history of high blood pressure, the 25-year-old Caceres is otherwise healthy. He still doesn't know how he caught the virus.



""I hardly went outside — I was taking this quarantine very serious,"" Caceres said. ""The few times I went out I had masks and gloves.""



It started in late March when Caceres started to feel ill. He thought it was the flu and he just needed rest. But his mother, Dorka, became concerned when he started to complain of chest pain. She thought something might be wrong with his heart and decided to call 911. The EMT checked Caceres, said his heart was fine and decided against taking him to the hospital because he didn't display symptoms of the virus. But his condition quickly deteriorated after the EMT visit as he started experiencing severe shortness of breath. ""I couldn't breathe — I was literally just gasping for air,"" Caceres said. "" I would just take a few steps and it felt like I ran a marathon."" His mother and brother saw how ill he suddenly looked and called the ambulance again. That's around the time Caceres went unconscious. His family wasn't able to visit him while he was hospitalized and intubated due to protocols to prevent the virus from spreading. Caceres' lungs and kidneys weren't functioning properly. During those 11 days, his mother Dorka feared for his life and would call the hospital constantly to check on his condition.



""I truly feel like if I was alone I probably would have died because I wasn't aware of anything — I couldn't do anything,"" Caceres said.

'It just hit home'

Caceres lives in the Bronx, one of the hardest-hit boroughs in the hardest-hit city in the U.S. More than 42,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Bronx and at least 3,293 have died from Covid-19 as of Friday. Every day brings more death and infections.



People are fighting for their lives and their livelihoods as the virus rips through the borough and businesses deemed nonessential by the state have remained closed for eight weeks now in an effort to contain the epidemic. The Bronx is particularly vulnerable to the public health and economic crises triggered by the virus. The borough has the lowest health outcomes in New York state and has high rates of asthma and diabetes. The number of people living in poverty is the highest in New York City at 27%. Amaurys Grullon, 27, was tired of the stereotypes he always heard about his home when growing up. In 2016, Grullon founded a business called Bronx Native to showcase the borough's culture and creativity. He asked Caceres, his childhood friend, to join the business as brand manager and help run the store.

""For me the Bronx is the most beautiful place on Earth — I wanted to change the narrative,"" Grullon said. The store, located in Mott Haven, sells apparel, accessories and acts as community space to the neighborhood, hosting everything from comedy to financial literacy classes. Business was good until the pandemic, Grullon said. They had to close the shop's doors when the state declared their business nonessential, and sales fell 50% even as the store has ramped up its online business to compensate, Grullon said. Then, as the business was in turmoil, Caceres caught the virus.



Grullon knew something was wrong when Caceres wasn't responding to his messages. He contacted Caceres' mother, who told him his friend had fallen into a coma.



""When I heard that news — it's when I really realized this is serious,"" Grullon said. ""Josue is a young kid, 25 — younger than me. It just hit home, and when things hit home they hit differently.""

'We're in a very difficult position'

Caceres' lungs started responding, his condition started to improve and he was taken off intubation. He survived the virus and is healthy now, but it's unclear if Bronx Native will survive the shutdown. Grullon has applied for a small business loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help keep the store afloat. Grullon originally tried to apply through Chase, but he heard from other business owners he might have a better shot with a smaller community bank. He applied at Ponce Bank and also through PayPal. Unlike Chase, neither Ponce nor Paypal require applicants to have existing accounts, which has made it easier for many small businesses to apply.



Understanding the program and its rules, navigating the application and getting the right documents together in such a short time was frustrating. Grullon said he was totally in the dark when he first started looking into applying for funding a month ago. Bronx Native has since been approved for a $25,000 loan through Paypal. Small businesses like Bronx Native initially struggled to get their applications processed amid the confusion and technical problems that plagued the rollout of the program, while a number of publicly traded companies who were clients of big banks were approved for loans before the first round of money ran out.



When the program reopened with more funding, $30 billion was set aside for smaller lenders. The idea was to get money to underserved communities and minority business owners. The $30 billion ran out in less than two days, according to Kenneth Kelly, chairman of the National Bankers Association, which represents minority-owned banks.

The Bronx Chamber of Commerce is worried the retail vacancy rate will skyrocket due to the shutdown caused by the pandemic. Spencer Kimball | US

A government watchdog found minority and women-owned businesses may not have received loans because the Small Business Administration did not tell lenders to prioritize underserved communities as called for under the law.



Lisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, said few businesses in the borough received money during the first round of lending. The problem, Sorin said, is the Paycheck Protection Program defines a small business as 500 or fewer employees. But in the Bronx most businesses have fewer than 10 employees, which means they are competing with much larger and better equipped companies for money.



More businesses in the Bronx started to get funding when the program set aside money for smaller banks, Sorin said, but it's still not enough to meet the needs of the 23,000 businesses in the borough. Sorin is concerned the pandemic will force scores of businesses to close for good, ending a period of progress in which unemployment had fallen to historic lows and the number of businesses reached a four-decade high.



Many business districts in the Bronx are projecting retail vacancy rates as high as 50% by August, according to Michael Brady, executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. ""That's taking us back to the mid-'90s when the vacancy rate was out of control,"" Sorin said, ""and that's a very scary position to be in when we were in an upward curve for the borough."" Grullon said he can breathe a little easier now that he received funding after weeks of trying, but getting approved brings its own challenges. PPP loans are turned into grants if borrowers use 75% of the money for payroll among other conditions, one reason why the loans are in such high demand. Grullon wants to make sure he has a plan in place to meet those guidelines so he doesn't end up with a more than $1,300 monthly loan payment on top of his other costs. When he was still uncertain if funding would come through, Grullon started a GoFundMe campaign with a goal to raise $20,000 to help pay rent, utilities and vendors. He said the community has been supportive, and the GoFundMe money acts as a cushion during uncertain times.



""We are in a very difficult position right now because it's a very uncertain time,"" Grullon said. ""Everyday we're trying to figure out ways to adapt.""

'This was an older person's disease'

The crisis hit home for Noelle Santos when she heard that Caceres, her friend, was in a coma. Santos owns The Lit. Bar, a bookstore and bar, around the corner from Bronx Native.



""We were told this was an older person's disease and the younger people were just keeping the older safe,"" Santos said. ""Once our friend in his mid-20s got sick and he was in a coma for 11 days fighting for his life — that really shook us up."" Santos knew the situation was getting serious before Caceres fell ill. She voluntarily closed The Lit. Bar a few days before the state ordered nonessential businesses to do so. Santos was worried about the health and safety of her customers after the state first told businesses to operate at reduced capacity to help control the outbreak.



""They were leaving it up to me to protect people and I didn't feel confident in my ability to do that,"" she said.

In a video conference call Tuesday with fellow Central Division captains Alex Pietrangelo (Blues) and Roman Josi (Predators), Toews ended the Hawks’ coronavirus quarantine silence by reflecting on the sudden stoppage, his lifestyle since and his outlook on what lies ahead.

Except he already had forgotten the Hawks’ final opponent — the Sharks — before the stoppage. And, apparently, the days of the week. The Hawks and Sharks played Wednesday, March 11.

‘‘We basically woke up in the morning Friday,’’ Toews said. ‘‘We played Thursday night — I forget who we even played at home — but they said, ‘Don’t come in to the rink,’ and the season turned on a dime just like that.’’

To be fair, for the last three weeks, Toews has lived a lifestyle unfamiliar to him in prior Marches.

He has been cooped up with his girlfriend and their Yorkshire terrier, binge-watching ‘‘Ozark’’ and relaxing to ‘‘deep house’’ music.

He has tried to keep the Hawks’ meme-laden group chat under control, even as one of the relatively few players riding out the pandemic in Chicago. (In related news Tuesday, the NHL extended the self-isolation period for players to April 15.)

‘‘I didn’t have that motivation to do much the first four or five days,’’ Toews said. ‘‘Since then, I’ve been getting back and riding the bike and thinking: ‘Hey, at some point, this has to wrap up. We’ve got to go back to our normal lives.’

‘‘Just not sure when that is, so hopefully it’s sooner rather than later.’’

Toews said he has watched news broadcasts and listened to Joe Rogan podcasts to educate himself about the pandemic. He also has taken advantage of the free time to attend to some previously neglected responsibilities.

‘‘I moved into a new place during the season this year, and . . . during the year, you put a lot on the back burner with how busy the schedule was,’’ he said. ‘‘Just catching up, calling some friends, little things I don’t have time to do when we’re in season.’’

Toews also has had plenty of time to watch old hockey highlights and reflect about the gradual transformation of the league and the sport. That nostalgia led to a fascinating conversation with Pietrangelo and Josi when the moderator on the call temporarily lost his connection.

‘‘I’ve definitely had the time to sit back and watch these guys in the playoffs and the runs they’ve been on the last two years while I’m just sitting at home in April, May, June,’’ Toews said. ‘‘But the last time we won [the Stanley Cup] in 2015, Tampa was that first example of where the game was headed. They had smaller [defensemen] and forwards that could skate, and it wasn’t as physical of a series as we had against Anaheim in the conference final.

‘‘That’s where the game has really gone nowadays. Every team can really skate. They’ve got forwards and D-men on all four lines that can fly. I’ve just been watching some of those games and seeing how it compares to the playoff games in ’15 and ’13 and all those years.’’

That insight was particularly interesting when paired with some comments he made about the Hawks earlier in the call. That included mentioning how the injuries to veterans this season were counterbalanced by the growth of the rookies.

‘‘We showed a lot of signs this year, even if we weren’t sitting in a playoff spot right now, that we’re right on the edge,’’ Toews said.

For now, however, all he can do is wait to see whether the Hawks’ next chance to hop over that edge comes later this spring or next season.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

1102,191,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/magazine/covid-19-symptoms-doctor.html,2020-03-30,The Doctor’s Symptoms Weren’t Typical. Was She Sick Enough to Stay Home?,"
“I don’t know what you’re feeling,” the supervising doctor said over the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. “But based on the text you sent me, you shouldn’t go to work.” The 29-year-old woman, an anesthesiology resident in her second year of training, breathed a sigh of relief. “Now,” the training-program director continued, “tell me what’s going on.”
Two days earlier, on March 14, the young doctor finished her sixth straight day of 12-hour shifts in the surgical intensive care unit in her hospital in Boston. She was exhausted, but that wasn’t unusual. Yet when she woke up the next day, her only day off, she didn’t feel well. It wasn’t much — a queasy stomach, a little headache and brain fog. Her muscles were sore, as if she had lifted weights the day before. And when she took a deep breath, her chest felt strangely tight. She figured that she was just recovering from what had been a really tough week.
The following day, she felt fine when her alarm went off at 5 a.m. She got to the hospital by 6, but before the day started, she was told she wasn’t needed. All elective surgery had been postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and so there weren’t many patients in the surgical I.C.U. She and her co-resident made a deal: Her colleague would care for their patients that day, and she’d take over the next.
Later that day, the subtle symptoms from the day before worsened. She didn’t feel sick exactly, just not like herself. She had been training for the Boston Marathon, before it was rescheduled for September, and she decided to go for a run. She finished her six-mile loop with no trouble, but she still felt a little off. Was she getting sick? Her husband, a doctor at the same hospital, didn’t feel sick, either, but for the past couple of days, he had a cough. Could this be Covid-19, the respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that was sweeping across the United States and much of the rest of the world?
Typical SymptomsFrom what she had read, that infection usually caused a fever, cough and shortness of breath. The young doctor had none of those. She had a bit of chest tightness, but it didn’t make her feel out of breath. She fretted about it all afternoon and deep into the evening. When she came across a story online about an emergency-room doctor who had symptoms like hers and tested positive for Covid-19, she made her decision and texted the director of her residency program. He called her right back.
“Stay home, and get tested,” he told her. The next day, she was tested. By then, her headache was a little worse. Her muscles ached a little more. She spent much of the day in bed. Her husband’s symptoms didn’t change; he still had the same dry cough. Neither of them had a fever. Two days later, she felt fine; not 100 percent but close. She went for her usual run.
Guilt Sets InGiven how well she now felt, the young doctor wondered: Had she called in sick for a headache, unnecessarily increasing the workload on her fellow residents? There’s an informal motto that says a doctor should either “round or be rounded on.” You are well enough to work until you are sick enough to be in the hospital as a patient. A doctor should put patient care above everything else. A 2012 study found that more than half of all residents surveyed admitted to going to work when they were sick with flulike symptoms.
And yet she knew that to go to work with even the slightest chance of a Covid-19 infection would be irresponsible. She hoped that the test would be positive — that she was right to call in sick even though she wasn’t very sick.
It took four days for the results to come back. A nurse from her hospital called to let her know: She’d tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband, who hadn’t been tested, probably had the virus as well. Both of them would need to stay home for at least one week after the start of their symptoms, the nurse instructed. And before going back to work, both would have to have a negative test result.
A Sense of VindicationAfter the phone call, the young woman was overwhelmed with relief. Later that morning, the head of her residency program called. How would she feel about letting her colleagues know about her diagnosis? This way they might feel better about calling in sick if they had symptoms that didn’t seem that bad. Remembering how important the story about the E.R. doctor had been in her own decision, she immediately agreed. She’d already called the people she interacted with on her last morning at work.
In an email, she described her symptoms and the anxiety she had about calling in sick. “It can be tough to stay home, especially at a time like this, but it’s the best thing that we can do to keep our patients, families and each other safe,” she wrote. Once she hit send, she felt a sense of satisfaction, she told me. But that night, although she believed she was done with this virus, she found that it wasn’t done with her.
Unexpected New SymptomsOn March 21, a week after her first symptoms, the young resident was reading a book when suddenly she felt as if her chest was squeezed tight, as if there was a band restricting the expansion of her ribs and lungs. She’d never felt anything like it before, and it scared her. She stood and felt lightheaded. “I don’t feel good,” she said to her husband. “I can’t breathe.” The suddenness with which this came on argued against its being a pneumonia. Could this be a panic attack? She tried taking deep breaths and relaxing. It didn’t help. She needed to go to the E.R., she told him. She put on a face mask, and the couple headed to the hospital where they worked. The woman fought against a rising sense of panic. Every stoplight seemed torture. There were reports of this virus causing sudden death. Was she dying? Would it just keep getting harder to breathe?
In the emergency room, her heart was beating faster than normal, and she was breathing rapidly, but her oxygen level was fine. “Don’t leave me alone,” she pleaded with her husband and the nurse who took her to a negative-pressure room.
Over the course of the next couple of hours, blood tests were done, and an EKG and X-ray were performed. Her doctors wanted to make sure she didn’t have something on top of her known viral infection. One blood test looked for an increase in white blood cells in her circulation — a sign of a possible bacterial infection. It was normal. The other tests were equally unrevealing. The EKG showed no evidence of heart damage. The chest X-ray showed no sign of a pneumonia. The weight on the young woman’s chest didn’t get better, but it got no worse. Early reports of Covid-19 cases in China showed that some patients who already had serious symptoms suddenly got worse a week or more into their illness, a so-called second-week crash. It’s still not clear exactly what might be causing this late exacerbation. After promising the doctors she’d come back if she felt any worse, the young doctor and her husband went home.
Getting Back to WorkI spoke with the patient on March 26, and she told me she was feeling better. She gets a little out of breath when she climbs the four flights of stairs to her apartment, but even that is improving.
Right now, she’s focused on going back to work — she recently tested negative. Although no one knows for certain if getting the infection provides long-term immunity, current thinking is that she is probably immune to the virus for now. She is eager to return to the fight and, given the proper equipment, is ready to take her place at the very front lines of this war.",real

Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Professional soccer has been suspended since March and with no clear date set for a return, Michael Bennett says the uncertainty has led to anxiety.

“They don’t know if they’re going to go back to football, they don’t know if the football season will start again, they’re not sure what’s going on,” he added.

“There are financial situations with clubs furloughing players, there is deferral of wages. We’ve got a number of players who are living from paycheck to paycheck and this is having a real impact on them emotionally.

“Also health issues – if we do go back to the season, can it work? Will it work? What about my family? All those sort of ‘what if?’ questions kept coming up.”

The Premier League hopes to restart the season in June with matches to be played without fans at stadiums, while the second-tier Championship clubs will vote this week on how to conclude the season.

The white banner with images of red crosses had been hastily erected in front of two pop-up tents at a convenience store parking lot in central Louisville, Ky. “Covid-19 testing here,” it read.
A clutch of workers in white hazmat suits swabbed the mouths of drivers, who had each forked over $240 to learn whether they had been infected with the coronavirus.
“I have managed hospitals for years,” a man in charge told journalists and skeptical community activists at the scene on Wednesday. “We are doing things the right way.”
But nothing about the venture was right, from the workers’ failure to change gloves between customers to a bogus claim on a sign that the operation was approved by “HIPPA,” a misspelled acronym for the federal law that restricts how health data can be shared.
Instead, said David James, the president of the Louisville Metro Council, it was a flagrant attempt to con panicked citizens into handing over their money, along with social security numbers and credit card information that could be used for identity theft.
“It was ridiculous,” Mr. James said. He estimated that more than 100 people were deceived before the leaders of the apparently fake testers threw their supplies into the back of a truck and fled north up the highway.
Federal, state and local law enforcement authorities are reporting an explosion of such scams as fraudsters move to capitalize on public panic over the fast-moving pandemic and the flood of federal money making its way to most Americans to help address the economic fallout.
“We are seeing fraud across the board, everything from low-tech to very sophisticated schemes,” said G. Zachary Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The pandemic has affected so many people in so many different ways, he said, that “it just allows the fraudsters to have their buffet, as it were, to prey upon vulnerable people.”
Seeking to stay ahead of the curve, the Justice Department has set up a task force to investigate price-gouging and prosecutors have been instructed to prioritize fraud cases. With more than $2 trillion in federal assistance pouring into the economy, the authorities are girding for both lone wolf operations and more complicated schemes akin to those that arose during the 2008 federal program to bail out financial institutions.
Other agencies have followed suit. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to more than 15 companies peddling unproven treatments or diagnostic tests. State attorneys general are fighting the same practices by issuing cease-and-desist orders.
The Environmental Protection Agency has threatened legal action against retailers that sell unregistered disinfectants and sanitizers that falsely claim to protect against the virus. And the Federal Trade Commission reported Tuesday that the number of coronavirus-related complaints it had received from consumers this year had doubled during the previous week, reaching more than 7,800.
“Scams follow the headlines, and that’s certainly the case with this,” said Monica Vaca, a consumer protection lawyer for the agency.
Last month, Dr. Alexander G. Salerno, an internist in East Orange, N.J., was desperately searching for personal protective equipment for his fellow medical workers. “It is like trying to find spare change in your couch,” he said.
His regular suppliers were out, but through similarly hard-pressed medical providers commiserating in a WhatsApp group chat, he was able to contact several sellers. A man who never revealed his name to Dr. Salerno — and who the authorities later said was operating out of an auto body shop — agreed to sell him 3,000 surgical masks and 2,800 sterile gowns for $12,000, a markup of about 700 percent. Dr. Salerno wired the money to a bank account.
When he went to pick up some of the supplies on March 18, he said, the man led him to a warehouse packed with enough medical equipment to outfit an entire hospital.
Inside, he saw pallet upon pallet of N95 protective masks, surgical gowns, Clorox wipes and hand sanitizers. “He had everything, right from the factory, certified real stuff,” Dr. Salerno said.
The doctor said he tried and failed to alert the state attorney general’s office. But the morning after a local television station aired a story about his experience, F.B.I. agents appeared at his office.
“We jumped all over it,” said Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey who leads the task force from Newark. “It’s outrageous. If I was married to, or if I was a health care professional, I would be horrified right now that I can’t get the simple equipment I need for protection.”
The seller, Baruch Feldheim of Brooklyn, ran a company called “Solo Supplies” that had compiled a vast stockpile on the open market, including from a source in Canada, of 192,000 N95 masks, 598,000 pairs of surgical gloves and 130,000 other items like surgical masks, the authorities said.
Mr. Feldheim was arrested on Monday and charged with false statements and — because agents said he deliberately coughed in their direction and said he was sick with the virus — assaulting a federal officer. Asked why he was not charged with the crime of hoarding essential materials, authorities said that the investigation was continuing.
Using its authority under the Defense Production Act, the federal government bought Mr. Feldheim’s entire inventory — at standard prices — and shipped it to hard-pressed medical workers in New York and New Jersey.
“It’s just about the most un-American thing that I have encountered in my life,” Mr. Carpenito said. “People are out there looking to profit, despicably, from the greatest national crisis we have seen since World War II.”
The Newark case is one of a handful that federal prosecutors have brought over the past few weeks. In Austin, Texas, the F.B.I. shut down a website that promised consumers access to World Health Organization “vaccine kits” in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95, payable by credit card. No vaccine for the virus exists.
In Georgia, F.B.I. agents arrested a 49-year-old man on charges of collecting kickbacks for Covid-19 tests and screenings for other respiratory illnesses in a scheme that aimed to submit $1.1 million in fraudulent Medicare claims. According to court documents, the man was upfront about his motives.
“Everybody has been chasing the Covid dollar bird,” he said in a telephone conversation, according to court papers. “While there are people going through what they are going through, you can either go bankrupt or you can prosper.”
That was apparently the view of another operator who promised a California union of nearly 100,000 health care workers that he could provide them 39 million N95 masks. But when health care providers like Kaiser Permanente sought to verify and inspect the man’s supply chain, he proved more and more elusive.
Last week, a federal prosecutor contacted the union, the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, for details about the seller. “As far as we know, no money changed hands,” said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the union, which was trying to serve as an intermediary to hospitals. “The really bad thing was, the masks were desperately needed.”
In Southern California, agents arrested a 53-year-old, small-time actor for seeking investments in a nonexistent company that he claimed was just days away from marketing pills that would ward off the virus and injections that would cure Covid-19. The authorities said his YouTube and Instagram videos, in which he displayed a syringe of clear liquid or nondescript white pills, had been viewed more than two million times.
A self-described genius entrepreneur, the man claimed in a text to a cooperating witness that a Los Angeles patient stricken by Covid-19 rose from a sickbed and “walked out 51 hours after my injection,” the authorities said. He claimed he knew a doctor with White House ties who was on his way to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for an emergency order authorizing his drugs and promised a $300,000 investment in his company would yield a $30 million return.
Law enforcement officials are warning consumers to be especially wary of cyberscams, including sophisticated emails claiming to be from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Red Cross or other health organizations. One study suggested 3 percent of coronavirus-related domain names registered since January were malicious, while another 5 percent were suspicious. State attorneys general, like Letitia James of New York, have been warning companies that register domain names to be more vigilant.
Such frauds are only expected to multiply as the federal government doles out financial aid to individuals and businesses as part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package.
Twelve years later, federal investigators are still pursuing bad actors who misused the $475 billion federal program intended to bail out banks and financial institutions after the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. More than 400 people have been prosecuted, including 76 bankers who went to prison.",real

The Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2. The company said comparable sales, which included online purchases, increased 10.8% for the quarter.

""Throughout the first quarter, our team and guests faced unprecedented challenges arising from the spread of COVID-19,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said in a news release. ""In the face of those challenges, our team showed extraordinary resilience as guests relied on Target as a trusted resource for their families.""

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Shares of Target stock were down more than 2% as of 10:45 a.m. Wednesday.

In all, 3,910 new cases were reported this week along with 472 new deaths, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. That brings state nursing home cases to 11,437 and deaths to 1,553. Last week, the state saw one-week increases of 3,229 cases and 456 deaths.

Long-term care facilities now account for 48% of Illinois’ 3,241 COVID-19 deaths, records show.

As was the case last week, the numbers, reported weekly, have inconsistencies from week to week and, because of lags in reporting, appear to be lower than the real-time toll the virus is taking on those facilities. Some homes, for example, reported fewer cases or deaths this week than last, an issue officials have attributed in part to further investigation revealing non-COVID health issues.

This week, 18 more homes reached double-digit deaths, bringing that total to 51 facilities across the state. Twenty-two have reported more than 100 total cases, with two homes over 200.

The largest increase in deaths this week came at Meadowbrook Manor of Bolingbrook, where 16 people died, bringing that home’s total deaths to 26 — the most in the state. ManorCare Hinsdale reported 13 new deaths this week and is up to 19 since the start of the pandemic.

The highest case count at any nursing home in the state is at Ludeman Developmental Center in Park Forest, with 265 confirmed positives and six deaths. City View Multicare Center in Cicero has 262 cases — an increase of 228 since last week, the largest in the state — and nine deaths.

Tower Hill Healthcare Center in South Elgin and Niles Nursing & Rehabilitation Center both reported increases of more than 100 new cases in the past week.",real

Furthermore,Â some of these outbreaks may be a sign that the coronavirus is mutating.

As of press time, the world has over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 333,212 deaths.

In America, states such as Texas, New Jersey and Idaho areÂ already in the first phase of their reopening programs. In Europe, countries such as Germany, Denmark, France, Spain and Italy are also easing their restrictions. With these in mind, itÂ looks like these countries are finally starting to come out of the disasterÂ theyâve been experiencing these past few months.

However, the same cannot be said for Asia.

Second outbreak in China a possible sign that the coronavirus is mutating

In Chinaâs northeastern region,Â which borders both Russia and North Korea, over 46 new cases have been reported in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, over the past two weeks. In these provinces, lockdown measures were implemented once again to control the spread of the virus.

TheÂ symptoms in these new cases, however, indicate that the virus behaves differently.

Doctors attending to these new cases have stated that theÂ disease manifests differentlyÂ in the new cases than regular coronavirus cases. The main characteristic that health workersÂ observed is that patients take longer to test negative. This suggests that people are infected for longer periods of time.

Furthermore, the patients in this cluster of coronavirus cases only experience lung damage from the virus. In comparison, patients in Wuhan, the initialÂ epicenter of the pandemic,Â sometimes suffer multiple organ damage across the intestines, kidney and heart.

In addition, the patients have a longer presymptomatic period, that is, the duration of time from when a person is infected to when symptoms first appear. In Wuhan, on the other hand, patients would manifest symptoms after one to two weeks.

This delay before the patients become symptomatic makes it difficult for authorities to catch cases early and prevent the virusâs spread.

âThe longer period during which infected patients show no symptoms has created clusters of family infections,â said Qiu Haibo, one of Chinaâs top critical care physicians, during an interview on state television.

TheÂ observations of healthcare workers in the area suggest that there is still a lot of uncertainty over how the coronavirus is manifesting. This makes it difficult for Chinaâs healthcare system to react, as it is already struggling to contain this new cluster of infections.

ComplicatingÂ is thatÂ these new cases of the disease are not being reported by authorities, even as they implement strict lockdown measures.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how China is manipulating their infection numbers to hide their collapse.

Meanwhile, in Wuhan, several new infections were reported. This is the cityâs first new cluster of infections ever since its extremely strict quarantine measures were relaxed. The new cases were discovered in a single residential community, ending a 35-day streak of no new infections. In response, the city is conducting blanket testing on its residents.

Other parts of Asia experiencing renewed outbreaks

After being able to handle their initial waveÂ of coronavirus infections, other parts of Asia are also experiencing renewed outbreaks. (Related:Â 51 Recovered patients inÂ South KoreaÂ test positive AGAIN for coronavirus.)

Similar cases are happening in Singapore and South Korea. In Singapore, one new infection cluster was discovered after a 73-year old Singaporean man died from the coronavirus in a nursing home.

After an outbreak of cases linked to a nightclub in South Korea, the countryâs government acted quickly by testing 35,000 people who had links to the cluster. Over 100 people who went to this particular nightclub have tested positive.

Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days.



COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 °C. At +56 ° C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week.

Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces

On the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on paper for less than three hours, on wooden surfaces and fabrics - for not more than two days, on glass - for less than four days, on stainless steel and plastic - for no longer than a week.



It is worthy of note that reusable face masks made of fabric, which many people tend to use nowadays instead of disposable medical masks (or due to the shortage of them) can be used repeatedly only after meticulous disinfection. As with disposable medical masks, cloth masks need to be changed every two to three hours of constant use.

At home, cloth masks need to be washed with soap or detergent and then treated with a steam generator or steam iron.

After disinfection, one should press the mask with hot iron without steaming it to kill all the germs that can live in moist fabric.

As medical specialists all over the world emphasize, such masks are intended primarily for sick individuals in the first place. They can be effective only in combination with other prophylactic measures (avoiding contact, frequent washing of hands, disinfection of items and surfaces, etc.). In addition, the mask should be worn by people who provide medical care for sick individuals.



Healthy people can wear the mask when visiting public places, using public transport, but the effectiveness of the mask in such situations has not been proven. Disposable medical masks made of non-woven material should not be reused or disinfected.

Coronavirus pandemic to end this summer?

Specialists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that 90% of cases of COVID-19 infection occurred at temperatures ranging from 3 to 17°C and absolute humidity from 4 to 9 g/m³. If their assumption is correct, warm and humid weather in the coming months may improve the situation in many countries of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the situation in the countries of the Southern Hemisphere may worsen. However, this does not mean that coronavirus will not spread in countries with warm and humid climate.



For example, in Thailand, where temperatures remain at about 30 degrees Centigrade all the year round, coronavirus remains active and tough measures to combat it. At the same time, the novel virus is now actively spreading in Syria and turkey, where temperatures already near +25C. Some specialists believe that climate shows no influence on the new coronavirus as it has spread on all continents, except Antarctica. This is just an observation as there is still no scientific base to explain the nature of the new coronavirus.",fake

Estimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death were used in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records, findings show that countries have only discovered on average about 6% of infections, and the number of infections globally may well have already reached several tens of millions.

According to the report insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some countries are experiencing much higher casualty numbers relative to their reported confirmed cases such as Italy and Spain while Germany has detected as estimated 15.6% of infections compared to 3.5% in Italy and 1.7% in Spain. Detection rates are even lower in America at 1.6% and in the UK the rate is 1.2%, both of these two countries are receiving widespread criticism from global public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.

South Korea appears to have discovered about half of their infections. As of March 31, 2020 Germany had 460,000 infections, based on the same method the researchers calculated that America has over 10 million infections, Spain has over 5 million, Italy has more than 3 million, and the UK has more than 2 million cases of infection. These calculations came on the same day that Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were less than 900,000 confirmed cases, which means that the overwhelming vast majority of infections are undetected.

Based on these findings international media outlets are parroting numbers from countries that are dramatically understating the true numbers of infection.

""These results mean that governments and policy-makers need to exercise extreme caution when interpreting case numbers for planning purposes. Such extreme differences in the amount and quality of testing carried out in different countries mean that official case records are largely uninformative and do not provide helpful information,” said Sebastian Vollmer, Professor of Development Economics at the University of Göttingen.

""Major improvements in the ability of countries to detect new infections and contain the virus are urgently needed,” adds Dr. Christian Bommer.",fake
1163,1627,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/no_pandemic_exception_to_constitution.html,2020-05-21,No Pandemic Exception to Constitution,"Does the Wuhan virus, which arguably escaped from a Chinese virology lab, supersede the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the U.S. Constitution? The owners of a New Jersey gym think not. They want to earn a living and pursue their American dream, and like most business owners and their customers are not stupid, suicidal, or children. They are American citizens watching their unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness being ripped away by dime-store Napoleons who see this pandemic as a chance to pursue the liberal progressive dream of controlling every aspect of our lives.

Atilis Gym in Bellmawr, New Jersey reopened on Monday morning in defiance of Governor Phil Murphy’s Coronavirus lockdown order. “We think so far, this has been just a gross violation of constitutional rights,” said Atilis Gym co-owner Ian Smith in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “The 14th Amendment states that no state shall pass any law that infringes upon our rights as citizens, and we’ve been forced into our homes. Enough is enough.”

As some states, mostly red states, open up and people begin to regain their lives and their liberty, it is clear this toothpaste is out of its tube. American citizens are as mad as hell and clearly aren’t going to take it anymore. Many, like the Texas salon owner who risked incarceration to feed her children, are not going to wait for an official green light from governors and mayors attempting to usurp their rights, politicians who insist imposing a police state is for our own good. The owners of the New Jersey gym have found out that the price of liberty is indeed eternal vigilance -- and resistance to government tyranny:

A New Jersey gym reopened again Tuesday in defiance of the state’s orders against workout facilities… and again police arrived to issue tickets to the owners. At least one patron was also arrested leaving the gym after refusing to give his name. Police also warned supporters gathered outside to leave or they could also face summonses. “This gathering is a violation of the governor’s order,” Bellmawr Lt. Mike Draham said. “You are directed to immediately and peaceably disperse. If you do not disperse you can be charged. You can protest from your vehicle… That’s all we have right now.”

They also have the frightening words of the Democrat Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson of Fox News:

Carlson asked Murphy about the arrests in Ocean County, N.J., of 15 men who were congregating for a rabbi's funeral at a Lakewood synagogue in early April. “The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights -- enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy replied. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this... We looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

The very Constitution you took an oath to protect and defend is above your pay grade, Governor? This is the attitude Americans are starting to rebel against. Elected officials such as Murphy are little dictators, little Napoleons whose true colors are being revealed, who believe in data and science but not the liberty and freedom of an American people who tamed a continent, split the atom, went to the moon, and beat Nazism, fascism, and communism.

Thankfully, some courts are beginning to wake up to these arbitrary and unconstitutional assaults on our liberties as free Americans unite and pursue legal action. In North Carolina, a District Court judge actually wondered what happened to the concept of equal protection under the law:

Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper’s restrictions on indoor religious services show a distrust of those who are worshipping, according to a ruling from a federal judge. U.S. District Judge James C. Dever III temporarily blocked Cooper’s restrictions on indoor services in a Saturday ruling, The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., reported. Dever said that Cooper’s stay-at-home order presents a double standard by only allowing up to 10 people at a religious service while letting businesses accommodate up to 50 people at a time… “The record, at this admittedly early stage of the case, reveals that the Governor appears to trust citizens to perform non-religious activities indoors (such as shopping or working or selling merchandise) but does not trust them to do the same when they worship together indoors,” the judge’s ruling said.

The judge did not mention that under Cooper’s order the Last Supper would be illegal -- an indoor gathering of more than 10 people. Freedom of religion is just one of our liberties under assault from authoritarians like Cooper. Business owners are being effectively deprived of their property without due process of law -- executive orders are not due process. Our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is under assault as “non-essential” gun and ammo shops are shuttered while felons are released as we are denied self-protection against them. We have lost our right to move freely, even speak freely, at least on social media that censors coronavirus response criticisms, or to peacefully assemble and petition for redress of grievances.

In Oregon, another judge similarly ruled the state was exceeding its legal authority by infringing on freedom of religion:

An Oregon judge ruled today that Gov. Kate Brown’s pandemic-related executive orders exceeded her authority. The case was filed by numerous churches and people of faith who were represented by the Pacific Justice Institute. The orders resulted in church, business, and school closings and required the citizens in Oregon to remain under virtual house arrest. The Oregon law gives the Governor broad authority in emergency situations; however, that authority is of limited duration. The Governor did not go to the legislature to seek additional time as required by law.

Not overruled at this point is Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who shut down Windy City businesses and put citizens under house arrest while the “public face if the city,” as she calls herself went to her hair stylist. Lightfoot has cornered the market on tyrannical hypocrisy:

Churchgoers defying stay-at-home initiatives amid the coronavirus pandemic could receive citations in the Chicago area. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said last week the city was preparing to enforce restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus against houses of worship holding in-person services. After churchgoers decided to attend services anyway on Sunday, Lightfoot said in a statement that city officials are working with law enforcement to monitor large gatherings, including ones of faith, according to the Chicago Tribune. “The local districts are reviewing reports of large gatherings that took place today at various establishments not abiding by the stay-at-home order,” the statement said. “Following that review, the Department will issue and mail citations where necessary.""

Wisconsin’s Supreme Court recently struck down that state’s stay-at-home order as an unlawful order that exceeded the state’s authority:

The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the state's stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic as ""unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable"" after finding that the state's health secretary exceeded her authority. In a 4-3 ruling, the court called Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm's directive, known as Emergency Order 28, a ""vast seizure of power."" The order directed all people in the state to stay at home or at their places of residence, subject only to exceptions allowed by Palm, the ruling says. The order, which had been set to run until May 26, also restricted travel and business, along with threatening jail time or fines for those who don't comply.

So far, such rulings are limited in scope and temporary. The assault on our Constitution and our rights is deep and broad and will only be stopped by a Supreme Court ruling that our freedoms cannot be erased by an edict from a governor, mayor, or a state health secretary. These orders are not laws passed by a legislature, and even then such laws should and must pass constitutional muster. As George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley observes:

""Pandemic is not a magic word that instantly negates all individual constitutional rights,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""A pandemic gives states a compelling state purpose in the imposition of restrictions. But when the state denies or restricts constitutional rights, it must satisfy a balancing test.""

Lockdowns have health costs themselves that constitute a compelling interest to not have them. Simply put, Americans cannot be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law and, again, executive orders do not constitute due process. There is no pandemic exception clause in the U.S. Constitution.

1181,1220,https://www.businessinsider.com/actual-coronavirus-deaths-in-italy-us-higher-than-official-count-2020-5,2020-05-16,"Coronavirus deaths in Italy and US could be up to double the official counts, new research shows","The coronavirus pandemic has exposed severe limitations in collecting data during a crisis.

In many countries, limited testing capacity and the difficulty of finding and identifying asymptomatic cases has likely caused many patients to go undiagnosed. COVID-19 tests can also produce false negatives if they aren't administered properly or if a patient isn't shedding enough virus to be detected in a sample.

Some public-health experts have suggested that the actual case totals in Italy and the US could be at least 10 times higher than the current figures. Death counts are likely to be inaccurately low as well.

""There are a lot of deaths that we probably will never know if they were coronavirus deaths or not,"" Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, told Business Insider. ""There could be a lot more people infected than we thought.""

Data from the Italian research group Istituto Cattaneo now suggests that the number of coronavirus deaths in Italy was almost double the total reported by the Italian Department of Civil Protection as of April 1.

Data from the US is less complete, but many states have reported spikes in excess deaths that have yet to be attributed to the virus, suggesting that the actual number of coronavirus deaths could be around 30% higher. In some states, total fatalities could be twice the current count.

Italian provinces substantially underreported their outbreaks

To quantify the true number of fatalities in Italy, the Istituto Cattaneo compared the number of reported deaths from February 21 to March 21 to the average number of deaths during that same time period from 2015 to 2019.

According to data from the Italian Department of Civil Protection, Italy saw around 4,800 coronavirus deaths across more than 1,000 municipalities from February to March. But in total, these municipalities recorded 8,700 deaths outside the normal average — meaning thousands of excess deaths have yet to be explained.

In Lombardy, the northern region where Italy's first case was reported, the number of recorded deaths was more than double the average from the past five years. A case study from the Institute of Public Health Berlin and the Italian healthcare network Centro Medico Santagostino corroborates that finding. The research found that only half the deaths reported in Nembro — a municipality in Lombardy — from February 21 to April 11 were categorized as COVID-19 deaths. Yet in March, the municipality saw more deaths than in any single year since 2012; the death count that month was 15 times higher than the monthly average between January 2012 and February 2020.

""Reporting of confirmed COVID-19 specific deaths represents, at least for some Italian regions, a substantial underestimation of the actual number of deaths from the disease,"" the researchers wrote.

Other northern regions, like Emilia-Romagna, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Piedmont, saw their death counts rise by more than 50%, the Istituto Cattaneo found.

Even southern regions outside the epicenter of Italy's crisis saw higher-than-average death counts from February to March. The researchers said one explanation for this could be that many coronavirus deaths occurred in people's homes, and therefore weren't included in the official case counts.

""The impact of coronavirus has spread widely across the Italian population,"" they wrote. ""Substantial increases in mortality are also visible in areas other than those traditionally indicated as coronavirus hotspots.""

The study ultimately concluded that Italy's true coronavirus death toll is nearly double the reported one. Officially, more than 31,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy.

US states reported an excess of unexplained deaths this spring

Though it's possible for some flu deaths to be mistakenly identified as the coronavirus, researchers at Harvard and Emory Universities found that the coronavirus has been far deadlier than the flu in terms of reported cases so far. In a new study, they compared the weekly death count for the coronavirus to weekly death counts for seasonal influenza in the US.

""Although officials may say that SARS-CoV-2 is 'just another flu,' this is not true,"" the researchers wrote. ""The demand on hospital resources during the COVID-19 crisis has not occurred before in the US, even during the worst of influenza seasons.""

During the week ending April 21, the study found, the number of reported coronavirus deaths was 20 times higher than influenza deaths reported during the deadliest week of flu season (over a seven-year average). Based on this analysis, the researchers concluded that the current number of COVID-19 deaths might ""substantially understate"" the actual number of fatalities.

""As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase,"" they wrote.

Across many states, the number of reported coronavirus deaths from mid-March through mid-April exceeded the number of typically recorded deaths from all causes during that time frame, a New York Times analysis recently found. Data from 25 states suggests only 40,000 of 55,000 excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus so far.

In New Jersey, only half of the excess deaths have been attributed to the coronavirus, suggesting that actual COVID-19 fatalities could be twice as high. The same goes for Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia.

Halloran said some of those unexplained deaths may never factor into the official count.",real

Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Monday (May 4, 2020), alleged that it has intercepted a human intelligence report that the Nigeria House of Representatives leadership was poised to forcefully pass the compulsory vaccine bill without subjecting it to the traditions of legislative proceedings.

In a statement issued and signed by the spokesperson of the opposition political parties, Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Monday, the body urged lawmakers in the lower chamber to rise against impunity.

The body in the statement alleged that a sum of $10 million was offered by the American Computer Czar, Bill Gates to influence the speedy passage of the bill without recourse to legislative public hearing, a development they averted as anachronistic, adding that the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila should be impeached if he forces the bill on members.

The statement read:

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered. “This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill. “The Nigeria opposition rejects the Bill and urges opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives to confront the Speaker of the House with these facts tomorrow at plenary and resist every plan to illegally pass the Bill. “We have been informed that the alleged deal on the passage of the Bill was struck during a trip to Austria a few months back while the financial support for the promotion of the Bill was allegedly received last week to mobilize for a push leading to the hurried attempt to pass the Bill by any means necessary. “Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none. “What if the world eventually does not find a vaccine or cure for coronavirus just like it has not found a cure for HIV AIDS? What is the hurry in passing a Bill based on speculation or is there anything else the leadership of the House would want to tell Nigerians? Is this bill what will stop the mass deaths and infections rising in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Gombe, Borno, Kaduna, Ogun, Bauchi and indeed all over the country? “Is this Bill going to revive and grow the economy and reduce hunger and give us more testing kits or bed spaces? Is this Bill going to stop the stealing of palliatives meant for poor and vulnerable Nigerians? Is it true that all these noises for the Bill is all for the alleged $10 million? “Why make a law for a vaccine that has not been discovered? Does it mean that Femi Gbajabiamila and the promoters have an idea of the vaccine and when it will be ready? When nations like Madagascar are making local remedies which is working, APC is making a law to compulsorily inject Nigerians with vaccines our former slave masters have not yet discovered. “The plan to push the passing of the bill is evil.” “The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC did not make any contributions to the drafting of the Bill and has even told Femi Gbajabiamila to suspend the Bill as the timing is very wrong but Mr. Gbajabiamila believes he can secure the silence and acquiescence of the NCDC with all the illegal powers been provided for the NCDC in the Bill hence he still wants to push ahead with it the passage. “We are saying loudly again and calling on House of Representatives to suspend this Control of Infectious Diseases Bill and await for proper input and scrutiny after the pandemic and charge all efforts towards giving the needed support to reduce the spread and find a homegrown solution.”

Infectious Diseases Bill: Nigerian youths blow hurt, reveal what will happen to lawmakers

By John Owen Nwachukwu

Daily Post

Excerpts:

Youth leaders across the country, under the aegis of the Coalition Against Vaccine Trial in Nigeria, CAVTIN, have issued a stern warning to the leadership of the National Assembly over the controversial ‘Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.’

The youths threatened to embark on all actions that are within legal means to ensure that the bill is not passed.

They also threatened to start a recall process of all the lawmakers involved in the attempt to pass the Bill.

The Coalition wondered why the House of Representatives, without warning and with malevolent alacrity, could engage in a plot to push through what it described as a very contentious and troubling bill.

The Bill was sponsored by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and two other members: Dr. Paschal Chigozie Obi, member representing Ideato North /Ideato South Federal constituency of Imo State and Rep. Sununu Tanko Yusuf, member representing Yauri/Shanga/Ngaski Federal Constituency of Kebbi State.

In a statement signed by Alhaji Aliyu Buba Amshi, North East; Segun Onibiyo, Secretary, Vanguards Of Democracy North Central; Ibrahim Bunu, Middle Belt Patriotic Front; Nze Ugo-Akpe Onwuka (OYI), International Coordinator – Igbo Renaissance Forum (IRF) South East; Sammy Brown, President, Supreme Council Of Ibibio Youths, South South; and Eric Oluwole, Yoruba National Youth Leader; South West, the Coalition said:

“One begins to wonder why the lightning speed to get the bill passed without being dully scrutinized by honorable members of the House, who incidentally were not presented with copies of the Wonder BILL. “As if that was not enough, while the citizens were still trying to grasp the movie-like actions playing out, the same controversial bill seeking to repeal the Quarantine Act 2004 sponsored by the House of Representatives, surfaced at the Senate on Tuesday the 5th of May, 2020, under a different title which read ‘National Health Emergency Bill, 2020’,” the Coalition noted.” “We wish to state without equivocation that no matter the nomenclature of the bill, we shall resist it unless Nigerians are adequately educated and sensitized about the benefits of giving such unfettered powers to the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC), which includes forcible administering of the COVID-19 vaccine.” “We, however, want to know if the vaccine trial has passed Phase 1- 3 before we jumped into offering our citizens as guinea pigs.” “Does Nigeria have the experience and capacity to run a candidate trial? “We are not going to sound nice nor complementary in presenting our feelings about the unfortunate games that we see being played with the lives of Nigerians at this very critical time, when COVID – 19 and hardship occasioned by the unplanned lockdown action has brought upon the citizens.” “We are by this publication putting the government on notice that Nigerians would not be led to the slaughter like sheep, and citizens cannot to be used as guinea pigs for vaccine trials.” “We shall resist any attempts by any individual, group of persons or organizations that would want to begin vaccine trials of any kind without first of all going through the right protocols and sensitizing the citizenry.”

The youth leaders declared that these uncommunicative gymnastics, change of document title and sleight of mouth to throw dust in the eyes of the citizens was dead on arrival.

Infectious Disease Bill: ‘Why the rush’ – Christian leaders blast Nigerian lawmakers

By Wale Odunsi

The Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the bill on Infectious Disease Control before the House of Representatives.

CAN, in a statement on Tuesday by General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, queried “the rush” to allow the bill to be passed into law with jet speed.

“The question in the hearts of many people is this: Why the rush when the vaccine is not available yet?,” they quipped.

The Christian leadership gave reasons it was against the moves by the Nigerian lawmakers.

CAN said the bill:

“was initiated to destroy the Civil and Human Rights of Nigerians; that it prevents Nigerians from having a say in their own affairs.” “Among this denial of the fundamental human rights are: right to life, personal liberty, freedom from inhuman treatment, privacy, right to acquire/own property, freedom of movement and religion.” “These rights are held sacred and invaluable except on clearly defined occasions as provided for by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

CAN reminded the federal legislators that the courts in Nigeria, on numerous occasions, struck out Acts of Parliaments and Legislation including Executive Orders of Governments, that were against fundamental human rights.

The body told them to:

“allow the Spirit of God to prevail over the primordial intentions and ambition; not to pass this controversial, nebulous and obnoxious bill into law in the overall interest of Nigerians”.

“We assess conspiracy theories linking the spread of COVID-19 to the expansion of the 5G cellular network are inciting attacks against the communications infrastructure globally and that these threats probably will increase as the disease continues to spread, including calls for violence against telecommunications workers,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Wednesday in an intelligence report obtained by ABC News.

“Violent extremists have drawn from misinformation campaigns online that claim wireless infrastructure is deleterious to human health and helps spread COVID-19, resulting in a global effort by like-minded individuals to share operational guidance and justification for conducting attacks against 5G infrastructure, some of which have already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states,” the report concluded.

Wires of a telecommunications mast damaged by fire are seen in Sparkhill in Birmingham, Britain, April 6, 2020. Carl Recine/Reuters, FILE

The assessment was followed on Thursday by a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI, DHS and the National Counterterrorism Center. Both documents were distributed to senior federal officials and law enforcement agencies around the country.

The federal officials who wrote the DHS analysis could not be more pointed about the seriousness of their concerns, saying the bulletin was “intended to highlight targeting and attacks globally against critical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and advise of online threats against critical infrastructure made by individuals including domestic violent extremists in the United States and others possibly driven by conspiracy theories. Critical infrastructure has been a longstanding target of (domestic terrorists) and current targeting observed appears to be focused primarily on locations associated with the (5G network) and the electric grid.”

The conspiracy theory is totally bogus and has zero connection to legitimate science, according to numerous experts who have researched the question and have been interviewed by ABC News. Once confined to the fringe of the internet, the theory says coronavirus is caused or spread by 5G technology, which is being constructed throughout Western Europe and the US as a means of improving phone and computer communications.

Eileen Culloty, a researcher specializing in countering disinformation at Dublin City University, told ABC News last month that “theories about 5G have been around for years, but were mostly confined to the fringes… For some people, the dramatic upheaval of COVID-19 demands an equally dramatic explanation. That’s the core appeal of a conspiracy theory -- it reduces complexity and coincidence into a simple narrative and points at someone or something to blame.”

As the pandemic first began to appear outside of China early this year, fears were heightened among law enforcement when a series of cell towers around Britain were targeted in unexplained arson attacks. By mid-April officials in the UK and US agreed the attacks were likely the result of the online paranoia having jumped from the screen to the real world.

Similar incidents have now been reported in the U.S., according to the federal documents.

“Since December 2019, unidentified actors conducted at least five arson incidents targeting cell towers in Memphis, Tenn., that resulted in more than $100,000 in damages,” the DHS reports say. “Additionally, 14 cell towers in western Tennessee, between February and April, were purposely turned off by way of disabling their electrical breakers,"" according to separate DHS field intelligence reporting. In April, arsonists set fire to a major cell tower in Portland, Ore., damaging electrical components at the base of the structure.”

Internationally, incidents were also reported in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, according to the documents obtained by ABC News. On top of that, union officials in England reported that “telecommunications workers have been threatened with physical violence in light of conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the spread of COVID-19.”

The chatter about 5G towers boiled over into an April 22 Facebook posting that “encouraged individuals associated with anarchist extremist ideology to commit acts of sabotage by attacking buildings and 5G towers around the world…in furtherance of an ‘International Day of Sabotage,’” the bulletin said.

Videos have also been posted online, showing people how to damage or destroy cell towers, according to the bulletin.

While many try to dismiss internet craziness as words without significance, experts fear the arson incidents could become another conspiracy like “Pizzagate,” which circulated during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In that case, false allegations that a Washington, D.C., pizzeria was a front for a human-trafficking and a child-sex ring were spread online by a number of far-right commentators, leading ultimately to a shooting without injuries at the restaurant in 2016. The shooter later told authorities he went to the restaurant to rescue the “victims” he had heard about.

The 5G conspiracy, unlike Pizzagate, has attracted people from across the political and ideological spectrum, according to intelligence analysts.

“We are seeing more people spreading these conspiracies, but equally disturbing is that more Americans seem to be believing them,” said ABC News contributor John Cohen, who used to oversee DHS intelligence operations as the acting undersecretary of the department. “In some cases, those people that believe the conspiracy theories commit destructive and violent acts as a result. This can be dangerous.”",real

Sanders formally endorsed Biden on April 13, but will continue to stay on the ballot in upcoming primaries to earn delegates for his representatives to have a seat on important Democratic National Convention committees.

Biden got 16 of Hawaii’s delegates and Sanders will earn eight. Currently, Biden has a total of 1,566 delegates to the party’s national convention, but needs 1,991 delegates to win the nomination.

Hawaii's primary was originally scheduled for April 4, however, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic Party of Hawaii canceled in-person voting and instead transitioned to an entirely vote-by-mail system.

Over 79,000 ballots were sent to the state party and nearly 35,000 were returned by mail by Friday which was the deadline, according to the announcement.

Just as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.

To find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News’s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.

By that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.

While the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it’s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.

How a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight

Take Hardeeville, for example. It’s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it’s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city’s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city’s large older population — the percentage of residents who’ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 — may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.

While regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it’s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.

But it’s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.

“There are going to be parts of the country that don’t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,” Wallace said. “If we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who’s going to be staffing those areas?”

Coastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.

Hardeeville’s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. “Being in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it’s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,” Williams said. “That’s a big concern of ours because we don’t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.”

Williams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn’t run out, but it also doesn’t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.

As of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina’s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.

The state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, “Amazon is a way of life,” but that’s not the case for working families.

“Delivery services are not as effective as, let’s say, New York City,” Williams said. “For the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.”

But even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. “Everybody’s pitching in.”

But more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina’s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.

Editor, Health Impact News

Those of us who have been covering the dark side of the medical industry for the past decade or so are fully aware that the medical system kills more people in the U.S. than any disease, using the medical system’s own data.

This is seldom, if ever, published in the corporate media which is largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry today.

The other fact that is well-known to most of us in the alternative media is that the pharmaceutical industry leads the U.S. in criminal fraud.

According to the Department of Justice (DOJ) website, the pharmaceutical industry is the largest offender of criminal fraud based on settlements and judgments for the False Claims Act.

From 2009 through 2016, Health Care Fraud resulted in $19.3 billion for fraud, with “billions more during the same period for state Medicaid programs and in criminal fines and forfeitures.” (Source.)

Housing and Financial Fraud was a distant second during the same time period, at $7 billion.

In 2017, according to the DOJ:

Of the $3.7 billion in settlements and judgments, $2.4 billion involved the health care industry, including drug companies, hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and physicians. This is the eighth consecutive year that the department’s civil health care fraud settlements and judgments have exceeded $2 billion.

In 2018, settlements and judgments for fraud against the health care industry again exceeded $2 billion according to the DOJ:

Of the $2.8 billion in settlements and judgments recovered by the Department of Justice this past fiscal year, $2.5 billion involved the health care industry, including drug and medical device manufacturers, managed care providers, hospitals, pharmacies, hospice organizations, laboratories, and physicians. This is the ninth consecutive year that the Department’s civil health care fraud settlements and judgments have exceeded $2 billion. The recoveries included in the $2.5 billion reflect only federal losses but, in many of these cases, the Department was instrumental in recovering additional millions of dollars for state Medicaid programs.

Richard Smith, editor of the British Medical Journal until 2004, wrote an opinion piece in 2013 about a book published by Peter Gøtzsche, the head of the Nordic Cochrane Centre, entitled “Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big Pharma Has Corrupted Healthcare.”

The characteristics of organised crime, racketeering, is defined in US law as the act of engaging repeatedly in certain types of offence, including extortion, fraud, federal drug offences, bribery, embezzlement, obstruction of justice, obstruction of law enforcement, tampering with witnesses, and political corruption. Peter produces evidence, most of it detailed, to support his case that pharmaceutical companies are guilty of most of these offences. (Source.)

The “largest fraud settlement in U.S. history” was against a pharmaceutical company:

On July 2, 2012 the British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline pled guilty to three counts of criminal misdemeanor and other civil liabilities relating to the prescription drugs Paxil, Wellbutrin and Avandia, and agreed to pay a total of $3 billion in fines–$1 billion to settle criminal charges, and $2 billion to cover civil liabilities. The payment is the largest fraud settlement in U.S. history, and the largest fine ever paid by a drug company. (Source.)

And these are the people we are being asked to trust to provide a COVID-19 cure with a new vaccine, when there is not convincing evidence that we even have an accurate test that can identify this “new” coronavirus.

Who pushes the Idea of an epidemic; what are their crimes?

“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” –Marcia Angell, MD (“Drug Companies and Doctors: A story of Corruption.” NY Review of Books, Jan. 15, 2009.)

With my coverage of the so-called pandemic, we are seeing many new readers showing up and paying attention. So I want to expose a few facts about the modern medical system—facts I’ve presented many times over the past 10 years.

I do this because of a little thing called REPUTATION. If the track record of major medical officials were really understood, people would ignore their current pronouncements with barely a glance. Pronouncements like: THE VIRUS IS SPREADING; THIS IS A MAJOR EPIDEMIC; WE’RE TESTING A NEW PROTECTIVE VACCINE AND EVERYONE MUST TAKE IT.

I also expose facts because MEDICALLY CAUSED DEATH is routinely swept under the carpet by the mainstream press. Actually, as a result of media silence, the subject of medical harm is where the subject of grossly poisoned food was in the 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time, giant food processors had created their own Wild West, where they could sell lethal poison (eat, fall down dead) hidden in products. The press helped expose these crimes and transfix the public, which led to partial reforms. Now, in the medical arena, the press is a partner in capital crimes.

Major medical officials have been sitting on a time bomb. The range of medical maiming and killing is astonishing.

Imagine a Congressional hearing held before media cameras, with reporters all over the world ready with shocking facts about one of the leading causes of death—

SENATOR: Sir, I have the mainstream medical death numbers in front of me. How can you keep this secret from the public?

FDA COMMISSIONER: It’s not a secret, sir. Many experts know about it.

SENATOR: I’m looking through the trillion-dollar federal budget. I’m looking for the money allocated to fix this horrible situation. Where are those funds?

FDA COMMISSIONER: Nowhere. Don’t blame us.

SENATOR: Why not?

FDA COMMISSIONER: Because we can never be dismantled. We’re eternal. God created the FDA. God created the CDC.

I know major media won’t investigate medically-caused death numbers, because I’ve published reports for years, and I’ve contacted news people with the facts; and nothing happens.

So we begin with a few citations.

July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association; author, Dr. Barbara Starfield, revered public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health; “Is US health really the best in the world?”

Starfield reported that the US medical system kills 225,000 Americans a year. 106,000 as a result of FDA-approved medical drugs, and 119,000 as a result of mistreatment and errors in hospitals. Extrapolate the numbers to a decade: that’s 2.25 million deaths. You might want to read that last number again.

I interviewed Starfield in 2009. I asked her whether she was aware of any overall effort by the US government to eliminate this holocaust, and whether she had ever been contacted by any government agency to consult on such an effort. She answered a resounding NO to both questions. She also said her estimate of medically caused deaths in America was on the conservative side.

Here is another citation: BMJ June 7, 2012 (BMJ 2012:344:e3989). Author, Jeanne Lenzer. Lenzer refers to a report by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices: “It [the Institute] calculated that in 2011 prescription drugs were associated with two to four million people in the US experiencing ‘serious, disabling, or fatal injuries, including 128,000 deaths.’”

The report called this “one of the most significant perils to humans resulting from human activity.”

The report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the FDA’s own database of “serious adverse [medical-drug] events.”

Therefore, to say the FDA isn’t aware of this finding would be absurd. The FDA knows. The FDA knows and it isn’t saying anything about it, because the FDA certifies, as safe and effective, all the medical drugs that are routinely maiming and killing Americans. Every public health agency knows the truth.

Here is another citation: The article is, “The Epidemic of Sickness and Death from Prescription Drugs.” The author is Donald Light, who teaches at Rowan University, and was the 2013 recipient of ASA’s [American Sociological Association’s] Distinguished Career Award for the Practice of Sociology. Light is a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2013, he was a fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard. He is a Lokey Visiting Professor at Stanford University.

Donald Light: “Epidemiologically, appropriately prescribed, prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death, tied with stroke at about 2,460 deaths each week in the United States. About 330,000 patients die each year from prescription drugs in the United States and Europe. They [the drugs] cause an epidemic of about 20 times more hospitalizations [6.6 million annually], as well as falls, road accidents, and [annually] about 80 million medically minor problems such as pains, discomforts, and dysfunctions that hobble productivity or the ability to care for others. Deaths and adverse effects from overmedication, errors, and self-medication would increase these figures.” (ASA publication, “Footnotes,” November 2014)

—Another study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 15, 1998: “Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients.” It, too, is mind-boggling.

The authors, led by Jason Lazarou, culled 39 previous studies on patients in hospitals. These patients, who received drugs in hospitals, or were admitted to hospitals because they were suffering from the drugs doctors had given them, met the following fate:

Every year, in the US, between 76,000 and 137,000 hospitalized patients die as a direct result of the drugs.

Beyond that, every year 2.2 million hospitalized patients experience serious adverse reactions to the drugs.

The authors write: “…Our study on ADRs [Adverse Drug Reactions], which excludes medication errors, had a different objective: to show that there are a large number of ADRs even when the drugs are properly prescribed and administered.”

So this study had nothing to do with doctor errors, nurse errors, or improper combining of drugs. And it only counted people killed who were admitted to hospitals. It didn’t begin to tally all the people taking pharmaceuticals who died as consequence of the drugs, without being admitted to hospitals. (Note: none of the studies and reviews I’m citing in this article include damage and death as a result of vaccines.)

The statistics I’m quoting reveal a human problem on the level of a tsunami sweeping across the whole of America and Europe.

Why won’t major media outlets report these facts and pound on their significance?

The obvious reason: their big-spending pharmaceutical advertisers would drop them like hot potatoes.

But there are other reasons.

Every medical bureaucrat or medical shill or medical expert who jumps aboard the media train, to assure the public that drugs and vaccines are remarkably safe, is sitting on the time bomb I have described above.

If this bomb were widely recognized, who would continue to believe these professional pundits? Who would accept anything they say? How could they possibly sustain their credibility?

“Well, the system I represent kills 2.25 million people per decade, and maims between 20 and 40 million more people per decade, but I want to assure you this vaccine presents no problems at all. It’s incredibly safe.”

Every single pronouncement, on any subject, issued via the medical cartel’s Ministry of Truth (major media), would fall on disbelieving ears, and only increase general outrage.

Mainstream reporters and editors and publishers are well aware that telling the truth would undermine a basic institution of society.

The media are there to give credibility to society and its structures. That’s why they’re called “major” instead of “minor.”

When hard rains fall, the media are there with an umbrella to hold over organized society’s head. To walk away in the middle of a downpour would leave the status quo unprotected.

“Defending the Crown” is another way to put it. The King may make mistakes, he may commit heinous offenses, but he is the King, and therefore his position must remain secure.

Young journalists learn this point quickly. If in their zeal, they cross the threshold and attempt to expose a central myth, fairy tale, legend, they’re put back in their place. They absorb the message. Journalism has limits. Certain truths are silent truths.

Over the years, I’ve talked to reporters who are solidly addicted to obfuscations. Like any addict, they have an army of excuses to rationalize their behavior.

The medical experts are worse. Their pretense of idealism knows no limits, and is matched only by their fatuous claim to bullet-proof knowledge.

When you peel the veneer away, they are enablers, persons of interest, co-conspirators.

There is nothing quite like a high-minded, socially-positioned, card-carrying member of the King’s circle of protectors. The arrogance is titanic. Because what is being hidden is so explosive.

It is the duty of the Crown to make his subjects feel safe and protected and even loved.

No wonder he needs such a large army of trained helpers in and around the press.

He has them.

But their monopoly is breaking down.

We’re in a new breakout level of truth. It’s called independent media.

So…on the subject of epidemics, when public health officials, and their government enablers, and the compliant press, and doctors tell us that a new virus is sweeping the world, a vaccine will stop it, and we must take that vaccine…why should anyone fall in line and accept their words?

Professional liars, professional criminals may pretend they are spouting science, but they are merely relying on the ignorance of the public.

It may interest you to know that the US system of reporting severe adverse effects of vaccines is broken. There are no reliable numbers.

Barbara Loe Fisher, of the private National Vaccine Information Center, has put together a reasonable estimate:

“But how many children have [adverse] vaccine reactions every year? Is it really only one in 110,000 or one in a million who are left permanently disabled after vaccination? Former FDA Commissioner David Kessler observed in 1993 that less than 1 percent of doctors report adverse events following prescription drug use. [See DA Kessler, ‘Introducing MEDWatch,’ JAMA, June 2, 1993: 2765-2768]” “There have been estimates that perhaps less than 5 or 10 percent of doctors report hospitalizations, injuries, deaths, or other serious health problems following vaccination. The 1986 Vaccine Injury Act contained no legal sanctions for not reporting; doctors can refuse to report and suffer no consequences.” “Even so, each year about 12,000 reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS]; parents as well as doctors can make those reports. [See RT Chen, B. Hibbs, ‘Vaccine safety,’ Pediatric Annals, July 1998: 445-458]” “However, if that number represents only 10 percent of what is actually occurring, then the actual number may be 120,000 vaccine-adverse events [per year]. If doctors report vaccine reactions as infrequently as Dr. Kessler said they report prescription-drug reactions, and the number 12,000 is only 1 percent of the actual total, then the real number may be 1.2 million vaccine-adverse events annually.”

Medical illiteracy in the population—the public health experts and the pharmaceutical titans feast on it. It allows them to get away with mass murder every day.

For those who think murder is too strong a word, I’ll close with this: it’s simple—when you’re in a profession that keeps killing and maiming people at a tragic and astonishing rate, and you know it and do nothing about it, you’re guilty. Period. No amount of evasion or excuse changes the fact.

THESE are the people telling you to believe their story about a pandemic. THESE are the people claiming the village has to be blasted in order to save it.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state’s toll so far in May alone is 1,727 people, and 4,058 overall.

There were also 2,432 more people who tested positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.

There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.

The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a required benchmark to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.

But the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, Pritzker’s office has said. Each of the state’s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to the third reopening phase, which allows some “non-essential” businesses to resume limited operations.

Graph not displaying properly? Click here.

The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.

“Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we’ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,” Pritzker said. “The good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that’s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.”

Pritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.

The state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.

All testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state’s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them — 1,129 — were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.

Hospital metrics are also key to Pritzker’s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.

Ezike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they’re admitted for delivery.

“First of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,” Ezike said. “But we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.

Ezike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.",real

The syndrome presents symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, including rash, persistent fever, vomiting, diarrhea, red eyes, swollen lymph nodes and abdominal problems. The Chicago area case was confirmed at Advocate Children’s Hospital, though it’s unclear whether the child is being treated at the Oak Lawn or Park Ridge campus.

“This appears to be a very complex complication of COVID-19,” said Dr. Frank Belmonte, the hospital’s chief medical officer. “We are currently learning new things about this virus every day. This is the first indication that children may be more negatively impacted than we first expected.”

The mysterious sickness was first identified in children in Europe and is now beginning to crop up in the United States, according to a statement from Advocate, which noted that the illness has affected “children as young as two and well into the teens.”

In New York, public health officials have identified 64 children with symptoms consistent with the illness. A bulletin issued Monday warned that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 could come back positive or negative and that cases may require both cardiac and respiratory support.

“Early diagnosis and treatment are essential,” said Belmonte. “If you have questions, you’ll want to call your pediatrician, or in more serious cases, go to a pediatric emergency department.”",real
1237,1964,https://theduran.com/local-elections-suggest-virginia-may-be-turning-red/,2020-05-23,Local Elections Suggest Virginia May be Turning Red,"Virginia was once a solid-red state, known for its strict conservative culture ad its overall affiliation with the Bible Belt south. If anything, it seemed like it would be one of the last states to turn to the secular left. That is, until it voted for Obama in 2008.

Many thought it was just a phase. After all, Indiana, also a solid Republican state, voted for Obama as well. After all, Obama was still socially conservative at the time. The trend however, continued. The Democratic Party went on to win the state in the next two presidential elections, along with the governorship and most other executive positions. In 2019, a second blue wave swept the state, removing Republicans from many local positions and giving the Democrats almost complete control over the state.

Many wonder how such a solid Republican, culturally conservative state located in the south could possibly have flipped so suddenly. Many believe it is the migration of unionized government workers along with Latin American immigrants that caused the shift. Regardless, a recent election has shown that the trend may be reversing.

Staunton is a small city located in the more populous northern region of Virginia. It was a part of the wave that resulting in Barack Obama winning the state in 2008. Since then, it has continued to contribute to the state turning blue.

A recent election, however, seemed to show something different. In a series of local elections, Republicans were able to flip numerous city council seats and regain control over the city council. Although Democrats ultimately received more votes than they did in the previous election, Republican turnout soured to unprecedented levels. A Virginia political analyst, Chris Graham of the Augusta Free Press, had described the results as “stunning almost beyond words.”

These results may suggest that although the Democrats haven’t lost voters to the GOP, many working class whites are being energized to vote for the GOP.

The recent policies enacted by Governor Northam are far from popular among that demographic. Anti-gun measure being pushed by the Democratic government resulted in pro-gun protestors filling the streets. Strict coronavirus lockdowns, similar to those implemented in New York and Michigan, are also angering much working class as well.

Of course, one local election in one small city isn’t enough to determine the political leanings of an entire state. It does, however, raise the question of the Democratic Party’s popularity and the mobilization of the white working class, a demographic that is continuing to become more and more significant despite is reduction in the overall share in the population.

As one of those students, my commute has been reduced to the time it takes for me to boot up my laptop, my classrooms have transformed into Zoom calls and many class conversations now take place on discussion boards. Tackling internships has also become a new kind of challenge in this virtual era. For many students, myself included, internships are a vital way to learn and gain experience outside of the classroom in the fields they're studying. This semester, I'm interning at CNBC Make It as an editorial intern. It's a position I started in person, and though I'm typing from home today, the work itself is largely unchanged. I still check my emails daily, research topics and reach out to sources from home. Despite not working in a traditional office environment, I still wanted to make the most of the experience. I also spoke with Barbara Safani, owner of Career Solvers, a career management firm based in New York City, about how students can make the most of any virtual internship experience.

Some tasks are easier to complete from home than others, Safani told me. Work that requires analysis, research, communication or preparation of documents can be well-suited for a remote internship. But ultimately, ""really any internship can work at home, as long as the person doing the internship is receiving some sort of consistent guidance and feedback from somebody on staff,"" she says. I have found this to be true during my experience at CNBC Make It. The work challenges are the same regardless of whether I'm at home or in the office. Two things that have made a huge difference for me while working from home are transparency from my supervisor and helpful feedback on my ideas and work. Even across a significantly longer distance, I haven't struggled with miscommunication. Here's what it's been like to transition to a virtual internship and tips for how to be a great intern, even from a distance.

The perks of a virtual internship

When I think about the time I spent in office, I always go back to the first day of my internship. I'd been surprised to feel my ears pop in the elevator as it climbed up some thirty stories high and still recall the feeling of trepidation that set in as it halted abruptly for me to exit. My new desk was adorned with a welcome sign and offered a view of the surrounding skyscrapers. The day started with an office tour that turned into a blur of warm welcomes and introductions. I did my best to memorize the many names I heard and chart a map of the office layout in my mind. But it wasn't long until I adjusted to office life. I checked in with the coworkers who who sat closest to me and slowly learned about how they each contribute to Make It. When I compare the experience of working in an office versus working remotely, what I miss the most is all the little incidental conversations I had: small talk by the coffee machine and by-the-way questions that don't happen as frequently now. Today, my desk is a dining room table and my cats have become my coworkers. But I've still learned a lot and found advantages to working remotely. I'm able to focus on the digital aspects of my work with fewer distractions, and I've become a more effective communicator during non-visual interactions. I word my questions carefully and really think about how they will be perceived before I ask them.

Safani agrees that there are a number of advantages to virtual internships. For tech-savvy students, this is a great opportunity to showcase your technological skills and provide support for your coworkers, she says. Shy or introverted students might benefit from working remotely because you won't face ""all of the same kind of visual representation of office life and power."" ""It creates a very even playing field,"" Safani says. ""In some ways, it might help somebody who is somewhat introverted or shy because it might be less intimidating. If they're comfortable with the virtual environment, that's going work to their advantage."" Transitioning from working in a traditional office environment to working remotely wasn't easy, but I was able to problem solve and adapt along the way. Soon, this new type of work setting started to feel abundantly more natural to me.

How to succeed in a virtual internship

This summer, many students will be embarking on virtual internship experiences. Here are three tips for making the most of your program, regardless of what field you will be working in. 1. Show that you already know how to work remotely If you are applying to virtual internships right now, a remote interview is the perfect opportunity to showcase how you've adapted to a virtual learning environment at school, since many of the skills you've gained studying remotely will be transferable to a remote professional experience, Safani says.

People applying for internships need to view it from the lens of, 'How do I prove to an employer that I can work remotely and be successful? And what are the examples I have to prove that?' Barbara Safani Career Solvers, Owner

""In any interview, it's all about showing what experience the candidate has in the past that will help benefit them when they go to a new company,"" Safani says. ""The twist on it now is that people applying for internships need to view it from the lens of, How do I prove to an employer that I can work remotely and be successful? What are the examples I have to prove that?"" 2. Focus on communication It might be easy to feel discouraged if you didn't anticipate this type of internship experience when you applied. But it doesn't have to be any less exciting just because it's online, Safani says. Focus on making the most of the learning experiences available and communicate clearly with your new team members, she says. Even though you aren't working together in person, interns can prove themselves as valuable team members by thinking proactively about how they can approach tasks and problems and by showing that they are able to take on additional responsibilities and challenges.",real

The stream, called the Mid-Season Streamathon, will feature competitive and exhibition matches from all over the world, and it’ll kick off on May 29th at 8PM ET.

On the competitive side, viewers will be able to watch the semifinals and finals for the Mid-Season Cup, a tournament pitting the top teams in China’s League of Legends Pro League and Korea’s League of Legends Champions Korea. But there will also be lighter fare, such as Turkey’s “Casters vs. Champions” competition and pro exhibition matches featuring players from North America’s League of Legends Championship Series.

Here’s the full schedule (times are in PT):

Riot has had to change many of its planned competitions and events this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including canceling the Mid-Season Invitational, one of the league’s premier international competitions. So the Mid-Season Streamathon could give fans something to look forward even though some other events have been called off. Many other esports competitions have also been affected by the pandemic, including Dota 2’s The International, which has been indefinitely delayed, the fighting game tournament EVO, which will be online-only, and the next Fortnite World Cup, which won’t happen until 2021 at the earliest.

Viewers will be able to donate during the Mid-Season Streamathon to support COVID-19 relief efforts. “Fan donations will be distributed by the Riot Games Social Impact Fund to organizations around the world such as the ImpactAssets COVID Response Fund and the GlobalGiving Coronavirus Relief Fund,” according to Riot.",real

By adhering to the set of reasonable principles outlined in this document, states can get their citizens back to work safely. With safeguards in place, the nation can manage the invisible threat of coronavirus and restore the public’s confidence. Work and free enterprise will fill store shelves and supply much-needed services. There is pent-up demand. Work is the backbone of wealth, and without prosperity, the nation jeopardizes its chances of fighting off the next threat.

Without prosperity, there will be pain and hardship, and the damage to economic stability and well-being will only increase the already-rising public unrest and lead to a powerful undermining of the legitimacy of governments.

The federal government has injected trillions of dollars into the economy, which is itself a risk, so this is no time to sit in the trenches and create arbitrary benchmarks regarding public safety. Life inherently involves risks; it is impossible to grow economies without making tradeoffs. States and individual communities are in the best position to determine this calculation because they are closest to the needs and capabilities of their citizens.

To stem the spread of coronavirus, New York's major cultural institutions announced they would be suspending performances or closing their doors, beginning Thursday.

Citing the need for ""drastic measures,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered an end to all gatherings of 500 or more people, effectively shutting down Broadway and all of the major nonprofit performing arts venues, including Carnegie Hall, the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera. The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced it would be closing on Friday.

Peter Gelb, the Metropolitan Opera's general manager, wrote, ""With health authorities urging social distancing with greater emphasis, it is simply untenable for us to continue to perform, as it puts our artists, staff, and audiences at risk.""

Most of the nonprofits announced they would be closed until March 31, but Broadway's theaters don't plan to reopen until April 12.

The economic impact will be widespread: In addition to ticket receipts of $1.8 billion last season, Broadway is the largest tourist attraction in New York, with thousands of businesses relying on it – from restaurants to hotels to taxicabs.

And the closing couldn't come at a busier time of the year. Six shows were to open before the end of March, while nine others were scheduled to open before April 23, the deadline to qualify for Tony Awards. Some shows, which have been struggling at the box office, may not reopen. According to Deadline, a monthlong shutdown could see Broadway losing more than $100 million.

1273,31,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/orange-county-declares-local-health-emergency/,2020-02-28,Orange County Declares Local Health Emergency,"Orange County, California has declared a local health emergency in response to the coronavirus, and the county may now be set to start testing patients exhibiting flu-like symptoms for COVID-19.

The announcement is in response to a proposal to move patients with coronavirus to a facility in Costa Mesa. However, the proposal has created a court battle, and at the center of the dispute is the proposal to use the Fairview Development Center as a quarantine site, this is what drew fierce and swift condemnation from officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Andrew Do the Vice Chairman of the Board of Supervisors said. But he notes that transportation of patients to these locations does not “preserve the health of our community,” of over 3 million people.

Costa Mesa has requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge that has blocked plans to send coronavirus patients to the center, the status of which will be decided on March 2, 2020. US District Judge Josephine Staton has ordered officials to meet to answer specific questions about how the center was chosen.

Declaration of local emergency and local health emergency is intended to prepare not panic the community as this allows opportunity for officials to ask for mutual aid from country, state, and federal partners in the event resources become exhausted, and creates better leveraging of resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“With 60 U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support an emergency declaration, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles says the city is also taking precautions to monitor spread of the coronavirus, “The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation.”

In breaking news the FDA has announced the first drug shortage due to the coronavirus, which underscores the importance of securing a medical supply chain now. “We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage,” the agency said in a news release.

“The situation seems to have evolved quickly; the agency seemed pretty confident in statements a week ago that there was little near term risk. This may underscore the complexity of the supply chain and the challenge of knowing where all downstream ingredients are sourced,” said Scott Gottlieb, MD on his twitter feed.

Gottlieb has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE “We’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

It would have been great if the interview was longer, or if the people at the news station stopped interrupting and let him speak.

Other countries appear to have far better diagnostic capabilities than America does, such as over in the United Kingdom where they have implemented random coronavirus testing for those displaying flu symptoms as part of their protective measures to slow the momentum of spread.

(Reuters) - Health policy experts say the United States must dramatically increase the availability of tests for the coronavirus if it is to safely reopen its economy.
U.S. regulators have moved speedily to authorize many new tests, but concerns still remain about tests’ accuracy, and some policymakers say new testing technologies need to proliferate to fully contain the virus. 
MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC TESTSMolecular diagnostic tests show who has contracted the virus. Most rely on samples collected from patients using nasal swabs. The samples are then analyzed using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects viral RNA. These tests can be highly accurate, in some instances detecting the virus in 95% of cases.
The first diagnostic tests to get U.S. regulatory approval required that a sample be shipped back to a laboratory to be analyzed, slowing the speed at which patients could receive results. More recently approved diagnostic tests can be conducted at the same location where the sample is taken and provide results in minutes.
Examples:    - Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2Authorized for use by U.S. regulators in March, Roche's website says it is currently shipping around 8 million tests per month. It requires a sample taken by nasal swab be sent back to a lab for analysis. Roche says studies show it can detect very low levels of the virus with 95% accuracy. - Abbott ID Now
Approved in late March, Abbott’s rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostic test can provide results on site to patients within minutes. As of May 4, Abbott said it is producing 50,000 of these tests per day, and plans to ramp up to 2 million by June. A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic showed the test detected the virus in around 85% of cases.
ANTIGEN TESTSEarlier this month, U.S. regulators authorized the first antigen test, a new category of diagnostic test. This type of test scans for proteins that can be found on or inside of a virus. They test samples taken from the nasal cavity using swabs. Antigen tests can detect the virus very quickly and can potentially be produced at lower cost.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says antigen test production can potentially scale to millions per day. But they produce false negatives at a higher rate than molecular diagnostics tests.
Examples:- Quidel Corporation Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIAAuthorized for use earlier this month, Quidel said the test picks up around 80% of COVID-19 cases.
ANTIBODY TESTSAntibody tests take small samples of patients’ blood and scan them for antibodies, which the immune system produces in response to a virus. They can be conducted in labs or through on-site tests that provide results in minutes.
Antibody tests, also known as serological tests, are not as effective as molecular diagnostic tests in catching COVID-19 at early-stages, when patients may not yet be producing antibodies. But they can confirm if patients previously had the virus and have antibodies that might protect them against future infection.
The FDA recently tightened rules on serological test developers after a proliferation of unauthorized tests raised questions about their reliability. Researchers have not confirmed whether recovered patients who are producing antibodies are fully immune to COVID-19.
    Examples:- Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG AssayResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine say the test, which Abbott launched in April, has a specificity of 99.9% and a sensitivity of 100%, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives. Abbott has already shipped more than 10 million antibody tests to hospitals and labs.

""If our tankers in the Caribbean or anywhere in the world face trouble [caused] by the Americans, they (the US) will also be in trouble in kind,"" Rouhani said in a phone conversation with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani on Saturday.

He added that Iran attaches special significance to regional security and emphasized that some US measures in different parts of the world have led to ""unacceptable conditions"" but ""we will never initiate any tension or conflict at all.""

Iran reserves the legitimate right to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity and secure its own interests, Rouhani said, adding, ""We hope the Americans do not make a mistake.""

The Iranian president stressed the importance of strengthening joint cooperation amid the current coronavirus pandemic and said, ""However, the United States of America continues to make wrong decisions and keeps it inhumane approaches.""

He once again emphasized that regional security should be maintained by countries in the region, adding, ""We have always expressed our readiness for more cooperation with neighboring countries.""

According to Refinitiv Eikon tracking data, a flotilla of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for Venezuela is approaching the Caribbean, with the first expected to reach the South American country’s waters on Sunday.

The shipments have infuriated the United States as both Iran and Venezuela are under US sanctions. Washington has threatened to take measures in response especially against Iran, according to a senior US official, who did not provide further details.

In a letter to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif issued a stern warning against the provocative acts by the US which has dispatched its naval forces to the Caribbean Sea with the goal of disrupting the course of the Iranian tankers heading to Venezuela.

Zarif described ""the illegal, dangerous and provocative US threats [against the Iranian tankers]"" as a form of piracy and a big threat to international peace and security.

Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said Wednesday that Caracas will send planes and ships to escort Iranian tankers arriving with fuel to the country in case of any US aggression.

He added that Venezuela's navy and air force will welcome the Iranian tankers bound for the Latin American country, seeing them through the nation's maritime territory and into port.

You may qualify for paid leave

Justin Paget

Qualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Valid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut. If you're caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.

Help with utility bills

Andrew Aitchison

Many utility companies — including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others — have suspended service disconnections. You may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development's Covid-19 resources. Your state's website may help. Some are stopping utility companies from shutting off services.

Sign up for insurance

If you lost your job and need health insurance, some states are holding special ACA open enrollments. AARP keeps an updated list of extensions on state health exchanges.

Uninsured people in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York and Vermont can enroll for health insurance through their state exchanges through June 15. California is allowing state residents to enroll through June 30. Find out if you qualify for Medicaid by inputting your state, family size and income level on the Healthcare.gov calculator.

Rent relief

The CARES Act has aid for homeowners who are struggling with their federally backed mortgage payments but renters also have some help. Many states and cities have put a stop order on evictions. New York, for instance, has a 90-day eviction ban. A Columbia Law School professor frequently updates this list of state actions.

1285,1498,https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-milestone-moment-europe-coronavirus-response/,2020-05-19,Merkel’s milestone moment,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

What's the lesson for the rest of the country?","On April 24, as more than 25,000 Americans continued to test positive for COVID-19 each day, Georgia became the first U.S. state to initiate the fraught process known as “reopening.”

First it allowed hair salons, gyms, barber shops, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to resume operations. Dine-in restaurants and movie theaters followed a few days later.

Today much of the state is open for business, under guidelines including a 6-foot social distancing rule.

The move was controversial, to say the least. In the New York Times, Keren Landman, an Atlanta-based physician, epidemiologist and journalist, accused Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of potentially “setting us up for a punishing new wave of infections” by volunteering Georgia as “the nation’s canary in this particularly terrifying coal mine.”

Even President Trump said he “disagree[d] strongly with [Kemp’s] decision.”

But now 26 days have passed since the state started to reopen — and that punishing new wave of infections has not materialized. In fact, according to a database maintained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia’s rolling seven-day average of new daily cases — an important metric that helps to balance out daily fluctuations in reporting — has fallen for three weeks in a row.

Those figures are undisputed — despite a clumsy effort by state officials to present the data in a way that made them look even better. And they are a lot better than the experience in two other states that are moving to end lockdowns, Florida and Texas.

For the seven-day period ending on May 4, Georgia’s daily average stood at 746 cases.

By May 11, the average had fallen 12.6 percent to 652 daily cases.

By May 18, it had dropped to 612 cases, a further decline of 6.1 percent.

At the same time, Georgia’s seven-day average of COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,432 on May 4, to 1,239 on May 11, to 1,049 on May 18 — a three-week decline of 26.7 percent.

The numbers reflect a slowing in transmission. According to the AJC database, Rt — an epidemiological statistic that represents transmissibility, or the number of people a sick person infects at a particular point in an epidemic — fell from 1.0 on May 4, to 0.94 on May 11, to 0.88 on May 16. An Rt below 1 indicates that each person infects, on average, less than one other person.

So does Georgia’s experience mean the canary has survived the coal mine? And if so, what would the state’s survival mean for the rest of America?

To one degree or another, all 50 states have now started to reopen. But the process has advanced slowly, in fits and starts — especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where Democratic governors have tended to be more cautious than their Republican counterparts in the South, the Midwest and the Mountain West.

Ultimately, the answer to whether other states should follow Georgia’s lead and reopen more fully is that it depends.

According to the latest data, it’s true that Georgia’s seemingly premature reopening hasn’t produced a surge of new cases … yet.

That yet is important. The coronavirus doesn’t just disappear on its own. Wherever and whenever people interact — especially indoors, for an extended period of time, at a distance of less than 6 feet, without wearing a mask — it will have an opportunity to spread. Georgia is not some magical exception. It is entirely possible that the curve there will start bending upward instead of downward in the coming weeks, especially if residents get a false sense of security and really let down their guard.

But 26 days is enough time to draw some tentative conclusions. When positive-looking data started to emerge from Georgia shortly after reopening, experts were quick to note that its declining daily case counts were actually a window into the past. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus can incubate for up to 14 days before symptoms begin (though research shows the vast majority develop symptoms in less than 11.5 days). Then a patient has to get tested. Then a lab has to process that test. Then that lab has to send back a positive result. Then that result has to be reported to public health authorities. The upshot is that the first two weeks of post-reopening numbers still reflect the state of the epidemic before reopening. It’s only in Week 3 or so — i.e., now — that they even start to reveal anything about the impact of lifting lockdown.",real
1292,561,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/science/coronavirus-genetic-sequencing.html,2020-05-01,Labs Across U.S. Join Federal Initiative to Study Coronavirus Genome,"
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday announced a national initiative to speed research into how the coronavirus was spreading around the country, bringing together at least 75 public health, academic and commercial institutions studying its genome.
As the virus replicates, tiny mutations accumulate in its genetic code. Those differences help scientists trace patterns of transmission and investigate outbreaks. They also provide an understanding of how the virus is evolving, which can affect the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines.
Historically, laboratories studying the genomes of pathogens released only general information about them, often in academic journals. Patient privacy laws in some states also limited the details they could provide. But that began to change in recent years with food-borne illnesses, as officials realized that publicly sharing gene sequences allowed scientists to find links with greater speed and react to save lives.
Gene sequences are also shared to help track influenza, and officials used them to respond to Ebola outbreaks in West Africa several years ago and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The new effort, announced by the C.D.C. on its website, builds on that approach. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, said in a statement that he was confident the country’s “finest, most skilled minds are working together to help us save lives today and tomorrow.”
“The U.S. is the world’s leader in advanced rapid genome sequencing. This coordinated effort across our public, private, clinical and academic public health laboratories will play a vital role in understanding the transmission, evolution and treatment of SARS-CoV-2,” he said, using the technical name for the virus that causes Covid-19.
Participating labs have pledged to release their information into the public domain quickly and in a standard way, as part of an initiative called Spheres. (The project’s name is an acronym: Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance.) The sequences they share will be used for surveillance, emergency response and applied research, according to the federal agency.
Pavitra Roychoudhury, a scientist with the University of Washington’s virology department and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is helping to coordinate her institutions’ work with Spheres. She said in an email that the project, which launched in early April before being announced, had already “made a tangible impact in the number of sequences we’re able to deposit and make publicly available on a daily basis.”
She and her colleagues, as well as researchers at some other laboratories, have been sequencing samples for months, providing insights into the origins and spread of the virus in the United States. “We’ve been sharing what we’ve learned” with others in the consortium, she said.
Sequences themselves mean little without context. The consortium aims to standardize what information should accompany each sequence, such as where and when a sample was taken, critically important details to make use of the data. Dr. Roychoudhury said the group was having conversations about how it could present the data in a way that helps “researchers around the world who may want to use it to design vaccines and therapies.”
Other countries have announced similar efforts. Britain established a sequencing consortium more than a month ago funded at about $25 million, and last week, Canada did the same, pledging about $30 million in government support. A C.D.C. spokeswoman said the U.S. project’s funding was “being worked out.”
The effort is based in the C.D.C.’s Office of Advanced Molecular Detection. Duncan MacCannell, the unit’s chief science officer, said that genomic sequencing and related technologies had “fundamentally changed how public health responds in terms of surveillance and outbreak response.”
He said many members of the consortium were new to the field and were not traditional participants in public health efforts. They “were starting to sequence,” he said, and “needed some coordination.”
Some public health laboratories are doing rapid and focused work, applying their findings to investigations on the ground and helping guide infection control. Other laboratories involved in the new group, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, have a large national reach, allowing for broader studies that could help officials understand the transmission of the virus and its prevalence in the population over time.
Dr. MacCannell said the United States would coordinate its efforts with international partners, including in regions of the world where there were fewer resources for testing.",real

I watched the Boris Johnson show at 7pm with a mixture of rage and pity.

Rage that this man is able to claim the mantle of UK Prime Minister and secure prime time TV to pontificate on a pandemic he has so spectacularly failed to deal with properly since the start of January this year, and pity that he is so obviously out of his political depth that it would be no surprise if Boris is encouraged to ‘spend more time with his family’ in the coming months as the Tories seek to replace him with someone as brutal but more competent. Kermit from the Muppet Show would surely be a contender on the competency front.

Current No1 trending topic in UK tonight is #BorisHasFailed — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) May 10, 2020

Johnson has introduced a new slogan to guide the nation. From the clear and unambiguous Stay At Home – Protect The NHS – Save Lives, with the deliberate red for stop border adding to the serious message being conveyed, we have the wholly unclear, imprecise and confusing Stay Alert – Control The Virus – Save Lives, with the green for go border promoting a different tone and imagery. What the hell does it mean? Stay Alert? An empty, nebulous and shallow slogan that will prompt more questions than answers and lead to greater confusion and indecision precisely when certainty and unequivocal messages are required.

Scotland’s Message Remains Clear – Stay Home. Protect NHS. Save Lives

Nicola Sturgeon is Scotland’s First Minister and she spoke with more clarity and authority earlier in the day when she stated categorically that the Stay Home message remains in place and operational in Scotland. Individuals would be permitted to exercise more often than once from now on but only on their own or with family members and while observing the two-metre social distancing rule. It is not what I or millions of others wanted to hear. I hate the social isolation and Stay Home rules. I am desperate to socialise and spend time with family and friends. But there is absolutely nothing more valuable in life than our health and the health of our families. Those of us lucky enough to still have elderly parents and children of our own comply with the Scottish First Minister’s message because it is underpinned by the best health and science advice available.

What Boris Johnson has done is undermine that critical and clear message and in the process risk even more needless loss of life. It is well documented and a matter of fact that Johnson ignored detailed warnings about the UK’s unpreparedness for a health pandemic. He then acted too slow to impose a social isolation lockdown.

He failed to put in place a proper test, track and trace strategy despite clear warnings to do so. He failed to ensure frontline health and care workers had sufficient and essential Personal Protective Equipment to allow them to safely treat Covid19 victims and care for the most at-risk elderly citizens. And now he is playing fast and loose with the health of thousands of others by “actively encouraging” millions of construction and manufacturing workers to return to work from tomorrow when workplaces and building sites are wholly unprepared and unable to ensure a safe environment for those workers.

Workplaces Are Not Safe – PM Letter of Weeks Ago Still Stands

Millions across England are to be “actively encouraged” to get back to work in cars, bikes and by walking but to avoid using public transport. It is madness. More than that, it is irresponsible and criminally negligent. No instructions about face masks. No guarantees that transport workers will be provided with sufficient PPE. Does he not read the death toll statistics breakdown and realise hundreds of transport workers have already died from exposure to passengers on buses and trains who did not know they were Covid19 carriers?

It was only a few weeks ago hours after it was confirmed on 28th March that more than 1,000 people had died across the UK from Covid19 that PM Boris confirmed he would send out more than 30 million personally signed letters to every household in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland at a cost of £5.7 million urging everyone to Stay Home – I quote directly from that letter:

“THE PRIME MINISTER

“I understand completely the difficulties this disruption has caused to your lives, businesses and jobs. But the action we have taken is absolutely necessary, for one simple reason.

If too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to cope. This will cost lives. We must slow the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment in order to save as many lives as possible.

That is why we are giving one simple instruction – you must stay at home.”

“Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS – and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable. It is with that great British spirit that we will beat coronavirus and we will beat it together.”

“That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”

The bold emphasis was in the letter. The one simple message was clear. These letters were issued days after the UK Covid19 death total reached 1,019. On the day of Johnson’s new, ambiguous and vague message the UK recorded 268 more deaths, 3,923 more cases and reached a cumulative total of at least 31,855 citizens lost prematurely to Covid19. Many believe this figure is an underestimate but it is the highest total in Europe and data from the World Health Organisation over the seven days 1st – 8th May indicates that per million of population the UK Covid19 death rate is now the highest in the world, surpassing both the United States and Sweden, 3rd and 2nd largest respectively.

After seven weeks of an emotionally difficult and economically costly lockdown which appears to have at least slowed the rate of infection of the deadly virus now is the time to steady the ship and double down on the message. People’s lives are at stake. Providing sustainable incomes for all workers, self-employed citizens and supporting businesses to prevent closures is easily affordable in a society as rich as the UK. Dipping into the £205 billion put aside to guarantee renewal of Trident nuclear weapons is certainly a readily available stream of cash better used for productive than destructive purposes.

What lies behind Johnson’s Statement tonight is the priorities of the big business bosses and billionaires who are so anxious to see ‘normality’ resumed. Their ‘normality’ consists of millions forced to survive on inadequate wages and welfare payments to guarantee their continued and obscene enrichment. The health of ordinary workers and elderly citizens is irrelevant to them. The new slogan would have been more honest if it read: Back To Work – Catch The Virus – Save The Billionaires; or Confuse The Public – Kill 32,000 – Avoid All Responsibility.

Tonight’s announcement by Boris Johnson is the moment the mask slipped and the entire nation saw Tory ideology win the battle versus public health. Confusion and chaos reign and a second wave will be wholly down to an abject failure of leadership by the PM & Government. — lan Byrne MP (@IanByrneMP) May 10, 2020

Johnson and Trump Vie for Stupid Mayor of Amity Island Title

The stark truth is Boris Johnson, just like his political acolyte Donald Trump, epitomises the stubborn, stupid and selfish Larry Vaughn, Mayor of the fictional Amity Island in the 1975 blockbuster movie Jaws. Never mind the three incidents and two deaths from shark attacks in the previous seven days, including the death of a young boy and girl from the deadly shark, we cannot close the beaches as it would be ‘bad for business’.

The Jaws script is a perfect metaphor for the combined approaches of Johnson and Trump to the current Covid19 threat. Never mind the scientific evidence and real threat to health let us just get everyone back to work as soon as possible. Watch the scene where the Mayor articulates the business community priorities to overrule the police chief and scientific evidence and keep the beaches open regardless of the threat to life:

“We will be open for business. Those beaches will be open for this weekend (July 4th celebrations)”.

Policing Covid 19 has become impossible after today. My colleagues cannot Engage, Explain, Encourage or Enforce such woolly rules. This is now down to the public to Police itself. Please let’s avoid a second spike. @WestYorksPolFed @Cameramal — Brian Booth (@WYPF_Chairman) May 10, 2020

Trump has ordered States across America to ‘open for business’ despite the evidence of mounting deaths and increased risks from infection and Johnson’s message tonight is in a similar vein. He is rushing to get England out of lockdown in homage to the rich business interests who supported him in his general election fight. It is no accident that the US and UK are top of the Covid19 league table of deaths and incompetent responses to the pandemic. However, the gutter press is Johnson’s natural ally and they will weigh in behind him in the coming days and they will seek to undermine the more cautious and concerned Nicola Sturgeon. Hopefully, the Welsh Assembly will continue to put health first over business concerns, but I fear Northern Ireland will fall into line behind their natural political allies in the Tory party.

Boris Johnson Does Not Speak for Scotland

Boris Johnson did not speak for me tonight and he did not speak for Scotland. He spoke only for England and the narrow section of millionaires and billionaires who back his political philosophy. The fact some within his party are discontented with the pace of relaxing the lockdown and returning to their ‘normal’ is further evidence of the ruthless and callous brutality which pollutes the Tory party. I sincerely hope the people of Scotland stick with the health first message of Nicola Sturgeon and reject the big business priorities of Boris Johnson and his political party.

SUMMARY: Is this the end of American exceptionalism? Elon Musk's factory gambit. Why Ohio's governor is so popular. Jogging while white. What airports will be like, post-pandemic. Can we just give up on business travel forever?

Has the pandemic finally crushed the idea of American exceptionalism?

""Everybody gets a trophy.""

That's a favorite scornful phrase among conservatives who think America's being weakened by liberal affirmation culture. Critics of affirmation culture say that ""everybody gets a trophyism"" is delusional because it doesn't face the honest fact that some people, some organizations, some countries do things better than others.

During the pandemic, it's those who usually deride affirmation culture who are falling victim to it. The story that President Trump and many of his allies are telling about America's pandemic response is that we're doing an amazing job. On Monday, the president announced that we had triumphed over the pandemic. ""We have met the moment and we have prevailed,"" he said, later saying that he was referring to the growth of US testing capacity.

The president declares that our testing is the best, our healthcare system is the best, our economy will recover the best. And yet any honest review of the facts makes clear that the US's coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the developed world.

The top level of our federal government, gutted of talent, filled with lapdogs, and skeptical of expertise, has botched the national response. Nearly three months into the crisis, we have no national strategy to contain the spread, wildly uneven distribution of PPE, and rates of testing that are multiples lower than what we need — and what we were promised.

We need only look at how other countries have addressed the crisis to face the honest fact that we deserve no trophy. And it's not just a few countries that are leaving us in the dust: Almost every country facing the pandemic has brought its caseloads and death rates down faster than the US because they trusted in experts, planned for catastrophe, and built a centralized infrastructure for tracking and tracing.

This week in Germany, students gave themselves coronavirus tests and went to school. On Tuesday in South Korea, people went to bars (except in Seoul, where the city has temporarily closed restaurants after an outbreak last week). We're not the worst, but we're so far away from being as good as we pretend to be. We still love to talk about American exceptionalism, but in this case American exceptionalism means only that we're exceptionally mediocre.

This would be more tolerable if we had the integrity to be honest about our mediocrity. The president and his allies are essentially shoving their fingers in their ears, and asserting greatness. The president claimed again on Monday, as he did back in March, that everyone can get a test, when we all know everyone can't.

The White House undermines pandemic data, to try to delude people into thinking the pandemic is over. The president's team even distributed one model that, nonsensically, suggested that COVID-19 deaths would drop to zero by this weekend. The governor of Arizona tried to muzzle scientists sharing factual data about the spread of the virus there because he didn't want Arizonans to hear that the peak was still to come.

No one can stop the president from bragging about his pandemic achievements. No one can even stop him and his administration from sharing dishonest data to make their pandemic response seem capable.

But telling ourselves we're doing a great job when we aren't does not actually stop the deaths, the job losses, and the fear, and it doesn't hide from us the images of Germans, Koreans, and New Zealanders safely getting back to school and work.

There is a chance for America to redeem itself. We still have the best scientific researchers in the world, and the pandemic will not end anywhere till we have a treatment or a vaccine. I'd still bet on American scientists to develop these first.

As Winston Churchill (reportedly) said: Americans can always be trusted to do the right thing, once they've tried everything else. Let's hope we soon start doing it. —DP

Once again, Musk rolls the dice.

Lots of entrepreneurs pat themselves on the back for taking big risks — even when they're not actually taking them. (Losing other people's money and having to get a new job if you fail actually isn't that big a risk.) But Elon Musk, one of the most successful and inspiring entrepreneurs in history, does actually take big risks. And, today, he's taking another one.

Musk has reopened Tesla's Fremont California factory, in defiance of the rules of the California county — Alameda — in which the factory is based.

In a tweet, moreover, Musk has said that he himself will be working on the assembly line and suggested that, if local authorities enforce the county's restrictions, he should be the one to be arrested.

Bold.

Even bolder — and the point that Musk's critics are jumping on — is that, if the county's restrictions are sound, Musk may be taking risks with his employees' health.

No matter how frustrated Musk and other Silicon Valley go-getters are about California's tight coronavirus restrictions— and they are very frustrated — the goal of the restrictions is to reduce infections and deaths. So if Musk and Tesla are going to defy these restrictions, they had better be highly confident that they can protect their employees.

In his defense, Musk says he is confident of this. He says Tesla has learned how to protect employees from its manufacturing experience in China. The company has produced a ""Return To Work"" playbook that details the measures the company has put in place.

Alameda County has responded wisely to Musk's gambit. Instead of sending a squad car to the plant to drag Musk off the floor in handcuffs, it has said it will deal with the company with the same ""phased approach"" that it has dealt with other companies that aren't following the rules. If Alameda functions the way other local governments do, one imagines that this ""phased"" approach may take time.

Behind the scenes, Tesla and Alameda have been working on a reopening plan that would have allowed Tesla to restart production early next week. If Alameda is comfortable with the company restarting production in six days, Tesla workers are probably pretty safe today.

Musk's defiant reopening and tweets, however, raise the stakes, and do more than buy him and Tesla a few more production days.

Given the growing national frustration with coronavirus restrictions, they position Musk and Tesla as innovative, bold Davids battling against a bureaucratic Goliath. —HB

Why Ohio's Republican governor is wildly popular, and Georgia's isn't.

Governors are having a good pandemic. While the president's approval rating continues to slump in the 40s, a Washington Post-Ipsos poll finds that

71% of Americans approve of the job their governor is doing on the outbreak, and only 27% disapprove. But there's an interesting disparity between the ratings for two Republican governors, Mike DeWine of Ohio and Brian Kemp of Georgia.

DeWine's handling of the pandemic is most admired in the country, with 86% approval in Ohio. Astonishingly, while 84% of Ohio Republicans approve of how he's doing, even more Democrats — 90% — approve.

Kemp, by contrast, is the only governor with lower approval ratings in his state than the president. Only 39% of Georgians approve of his handling of the crisis, and Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove.

What's the difference between Ohio and Georgia?

DeWine moved early to shut down his state, has pushed hard for testing, and has a government that's clear and transparent about sharing data and advice. There's plenty of partisan rancor in Ohio, but DeWine has strongly supported the experts in his administration.

Kemp has practically been a coronavirus skeptic. He learned that it spreads asymptomatically about a month after everyone else did. He shut down Georgia well after he'd been advised to, and he opened it up way, way before experts wanted to — so early that it even irked the president. That push to reopen has generally hurt his popularity, with 65% of Georgians saying he opened too early.

DeWine's popularity today doesn't mean he'll coast to reelection in 2022, but it's a telling lesson that — at least during a pandemic — caution, clarity, and calm are good politics. —DP

Would a white man get killed for running suspiciously through a neighborhood?

The murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man chased down and killed while jogging in a Georgia neighborhood, inspired a white man named Richard Demsick to create a brilliant piece of political theater.

As Insider reports, the 34-year-old Demsick ran shirtless, hat on backward, through a largely white Florida neighborhood ... while carrying a flat-screen TV.

Even though the neighborhood had recently had several robberies, residents smiled and waved at him, and none called the police or tried to stop him. Demsick filmed the run for TikTok, where it now has more than 1 million views.

Does this prove that Arbery's race caused his murder? Of course not. But it's a dark reminder that we see different people differently because of their skin color. —DP

What will flying be like after the pandemic?

Post-pandemic airports will be crammed with temperature sensors, require masks, and have all kinds of new touchless technology, among other changes, according to Thomas Pallini's fascinating Insider interview with the CEO of a company that runs airports.

For a much gloomier take, this essay in the Atlantic says commercial aviation will be terrible (and really expensive) for a long, long time because of fear and low demand. —DP

So, can we finally give up needless business travel forever?

Many of us former road warriors have discovered that we can do our jobs fine using cheap, widely available videoconferencing services like Google Meet and Zoom.

Many of us have also remembered how much time we used to waste in airports, hotels, and planes instead of with our families, colleagues, and friends. So we're wondering whether we can finally take advantage of this crisis to collectively decide that we don't need to do that again.

The entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, for example, who is now hunkered down with his family in Spain, just tweeted the following: ""I used to travel a third of my work days. So much time wasted on Ubers, security lines, flights, hotels. Please everyone please let's accept video as the new normal!""

So how about it, fellow professionals?

Can we agree to save oodles of time, money, and jet-lag and reserve in-person trips for the few occasions in which in-person is critical?

Or do we have to go back to expensive, exhausting, schlepping as usual? —HB

The Big 3*

A mask factory cancelled a Trump visit because it feared it would spread the virus.

The US president was going to visit the Pennsylvania factory on Friday, but the factory bosses asked him to postpone it, to keep workers safe and the factory humming.

""Why are you saying that to me?""

A Chinese American reporter calls out Trump for singling her out with his anti-China remarks.

A hack for removing the tough white tendons from chicken breasts.

It's all anyone on TikTok is talking about.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
1305,737,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/10/21253823/mothers-day-2020-world-leaders-optimism-amid-coronavirus-pandemic,2020-05-10,"On Mother’s Day, leaders search for optimism amid pandemic","HOUSTON — As families marked Mother’s Day in a time of social distancing and isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaders balanced optimism they could loosen lockdowns that have left millions unemployed against the threat of a second wave of infections.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted the American economy would rebound in the second half of this year from unemployment rates that rival the Great Depression. Another 3.2 million U.S. workers applied for jobless benefits last week, bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33.5 million.

“I think you’re going to see a bounce-back from a low standpoint,” said Mnuchin, speaking on “Fox News Sunday.”

But the director of the University of Washington institute that created a White House-endorsed coronavirus model said the moves by states to re-open businesses “will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.” Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said states where cases and deaths are going up more than expected include Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California.

Many families faced their first Mother’s Day without loved ones lost in the pandemic. Others sent good wishes from a safe distance or through phone and video calls.

The virus has caused particular suffering for the elderly, with more than 26,000 deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an Associated Press tally.

At a senior center in Smyrna, Georgia, 73-year-old Mary Washington spoke to her daughter Courtney Crosby and grandchild Sydney Crosby through a window.

In Grafton, West Virginia, where the tradition of Mother’s Day began 112 years ago, the brick building now known as the International Mother’s Day Shrine held its first online-only audience. Anna Jarvis first held a memorial service for her mother and all mothers on the second Sunday of May in 1908.

“Sheltered safely at home with the family together would be viewed by Anna Jarvis as exactly the way she wanted Mother’s Day to be observed,” said Marvin Gelhausen, chairman of the shrine’s board of trustees, in an address on YouTube.

Matilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son’s daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother’s Day.

“I am so blessed as many mothers today are,” she said.

Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. “We’re going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite,” he said in a playful dig at his siblings.

He also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents’ relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.

The U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country’s coronavirus lockdown but urged citizens not to surrender the progress already made. The country has recorded the most virus deaths in Europe at over 31,900.

Those in the construction or manufacturing industries or other jobs that can’t be done at home “should be actively encouraged to go to work” this week, he said. Johnson, who has taken a tougher line after falling ill himself with what he called “this devilish illness,” set a goal of June 1 to begin re-opening schools and shops if the U.K. can control new infections and the transmission rate of each infected person.

“We will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity,” he said. “We’re going to be driven by the science, the data, and public health.”

Germany, which managed to push new infections below 1,000 daily before deciding to loosen restrictions, has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. Health officials say the number of people each confirmed virus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below 1 for outbreaks to decline.

France is letting some younger students go back to school Monday after almost two months out. Attendance won’t be compulsory right away. Residents of some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places Monday, but Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, will remain shut down.

China, where the virus was first detected, reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.

Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.

“Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,” said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.

South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea’s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.

There's no doubt the coronavirus pandemic has hit small businesses hard. For some, like retail and wholesale bakery Ovenly, it meant completely shutting down their operations. The New York-based business had to lay off its entire staff of 66 employees, said Agatha Kulaga, the co-founder and CEO. ""It was … just survival mode,"" she said. ""It was really about, 'What are we going to do? What are the decisions to make right now to save our business so we can reopen successfully when this crisis is over?"" Kulaga was part of a live roundtable discussion streamed on both CNBC's and Glamour's Facebook pages on Friday, hosted by Glamour Magazine editor-in-chief Samantha Barry. CNBC reporter Kate Rogers joined in, as well as Shyla Sheppard, founder and CEO of Bow & Arrow Brewing Co, and Erin Patinkin, co-founder and CEO of Seemore Meats & Veggies.

Almost a third of small-business owners have had to close their in-person business operations because of government regulations put in place as a response to the pandemic, according to the latest CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. In addition, 23% have temporarily closed their entire business. That's led to cuts: Thirty-six percent have reduced their own pay, 8% have cut their employees' pay, 13% have furloughed some or all of their employees and 11% have laid off some or all of their employees, the survey found. ""In these times, it's really important to just dig deep, have grit and determination,"" said Sheppard, whose brewery and beer hall is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ""It's really critical right now to pivot in this environment.""

Pre-Covid 19, the majority of Bow & Arrow Brewing Co.'s revenue came from customers visiting its taproom.

""Over the last two months, we've had to both pause and accelerate a few big changes,"" Sheppard said.

The loss of funding

For Erin Patinkin, the coronavirus' impact on the stock market in March led to the loss of $1.25 million in Series A funding she was expecting to get for Seemore Meats & Veggies, which only officially launched in February. While her first thought was empathy for the funding company, which lost money in the market, she was also concerned about the future of her business. ""I was really anxiety-ridden and really stressed but my only thought was, 'I have to make a strategy to move forward,'"" Patinkin said. That meant she had to let go of some of the ""ego"" she thought she would have around the company's valuation and get the proper amount of money, even if it was fewer dollars, to fund the business. ""For a seven-day period, I didn't even think about emotions,"" she said. ""I was just driving forward in order to ensure we had a runway for at least a year because I am concerned about fundraising even three to six months from now.""

Navigating PPP

All three women applied for and received The federal Paycheck Protection Program loans. However, they are still unsure about the right way to use the money and are hopeful there may be adjustments in the requirements. The federal PPP, which offers forgivable loans to cover payroll for eight weeks after the loan is signed, was supposed to help. In order to get the forgiveness, at least 75% of the money must go to payroll. The rest is to be used for other business-related purposes. The first round of $349 billion in funding ran out in a matter of days. However, an additional $310 billion was approved, and, as of Thursday night, there was still about $100 billion left in unallocated capital. ""There's a lot of pressure to use [the money] on payroll versus sustaining your business through several months of uncertainty,"" said Ovenly's Kulaga. More from Invest in You:

That means, with the guidelines in place now, the loan will not be forgiven. Therefore, she'll have to raise capital to pay it back. Bow & Arrow Brewing Co.'s Sheppard has also been conservative in using the funding from her PPP loan. ""I'm really hoping they extend that 8-week timeline,"" she said.

1321,139,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/03/schools-outforever/,2020-03-24,Schools Out…Forever?,"With just about every public school in the country closed at this time, the only way for kids to get an education is at home. Many see this as nothing less than tragic. Writing in Education Week, Stephen Sawchuk claims that schools are an “absolute necessity for the functioning of civic culture, and even more fundamentally than that, daily life.”

If Sawchuk is correct, the country’s troubles extend way beyond the coronavirus. While shutting down public schools is certainly a massive disruption, our civic culture was just fine before the government’s monopoly on education came to be.

The push for the government’s role in education began in the 1830s when a group of dedicated reformers declared that state involvement was needed to ensure all children get a better, more unified education. Leading the charge was Bostonian Horace Mann who, with likeminded souls, campaigned for a greater state role in education. They argued that a centrally planned system of tax-funded schools would be superior to the independent and home schools that existed at the time. As the late Cato Institute scholar Andrew Coulson noted, “Shifting the reins of educational power from private to public hands would, they promised, yield better teaching methods and materials, greater efficiency, superior service to the poor, and a stronger, more cohesive nation. Mann even ventured to predict that if public schooling were widely adopted and given enough time to work, ‘nine-tenths of the crimes in the penal code would become obsolete,’ and ‘the long catalogue of human ills would be abridged.’” (Emphasis added.) While Mann’s utopian goals obviously didn’t quite work out as planned, they did create a link in people’s minds between the “institution of public schooling and the ideals of public education” which tragically still exists.

A look at literacy rates is instructive. In 1840, before compulsory public schools existed, literacy rates were about 90 percent.

But today?

According to The Literacy Project, there are currently 45 million Americans who are functionally illiterate, unable to read above a 5th grade level, and half of all adults can’t read a book at an 8th grade level. In California, 25 percent of the state’s 6 million students are unable to perform basic reading skills. It’s way past time to reappraise the Mann-created mess.

Homeschooling certainly has its challenges, especially when foisted on families with little or no warning. But unlike in the 19th century, home learning today doesn’t have to be family members sitting at a common table going over the ABCs. With computers omnipresent, the best teachers in the world these days can, well, teach the world. In “We’re All Homeschoolers Now,” The Heritage Foundation’s Lindsey Burke cites just a few of the ample resources available to parents. Outfits like Zearn and STMath are providing their materials online for free during the coronavirus outbreak. Longtime resource Khan Academy has a wealth of educational resources. Prenda Microschool is offering its coursework to families for just $100 for the remainder of the year. Cato’s Kerry McDonald lists more resources here. Also, the Home School Legal Defense Association is a one-stop-shop for all aspects of homeschooling.

Additionally, many home-schooling parent veterans have been offering a trove of support to the newbies, many of whom will find their unfamiliar role difficult. Married to a teacher, Michelle Thomas homeschools her four children and explains how she and her husband can swing it on a single income. She extols the many virtues of educating at home: her kids have become close friends, the family has no competition in helping form their kids’ character development, flexibility in school day, etc.

Even families who enthusiastically embrace their new role may find the money lost from cutting back on work hours daunting. But, writing about California, Reason Foundation’s Corey DeAngelis suggests that the state could “give some portion of that funding to parents to cover educational expenses during the shutdown. The state could allow school districts and families to split K‑12 education funding 50–50. That could be a win for both groups. School districts would get to keep half of the funding for students who no longer attend them. Families would get to use half of their children’s education dollars to find a school or program that fits their current needs.”

As good an idea as that is, California lawmakers will undoubtedly pass on it. Any legislation that disrupts the big gov-big union complex is a sure loser. Despite the fact that kids educated by their parents outperform traditional public school students, the teachers unions and other wild-eyed statists have been gunning for homeschoolers for years. In March 2008, a California state appellate court ruled that parents who lack teaching credentials could not educate their children at home. Needless to say, this decision sent waves of angst through California’s homeschooling families, while delighting the teachers unions. United Teachers of Los Angeles president A.J. Duffy asserted, “What’s best for a child is to be taught by a credentialed teacher.” Lloyd Porter, California Teachers Association board member chimed in, “We’re happy. We always think students should be taught by credentialed teachers, no matter what the setting.”

Sadly for the unionistas, however, sanity prevailed a few months later. In August 2008, a state appellate court ruled that parents may indeed legally homeschool their kids in California even if they lack a teaching credential. No matter, the California Teachers Association maintains that allowing parents to homeschool their children without a state-issued stamp of approval results in “educational anarchy.”

At its yearly national convention in 2015, the National Education Association passed Resolution B-83 (exactly the same as 2011’s B-82, 2008’s B-75, etc.), which in part reads, “The National Education Association believes that home schooling programs based on parental choice cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience…Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum approved by the state department of education should be used.”

Also, courtesy of the California Federation of Teachers, there is a law on the books which hurts homeschoolers. It stipulates that enrollment in online charter schools be restricted to students living in a contiguous county to where the school is based. This makes as much sense as being told that because you live in Los Angeles County you can’t use Google as your search engine because the latter’s home base is in Santa Clara County, which is not adjacent to L.A.!

According to the latest numbers provided by the National Center for Education Statistics, there are about 1.7 million home schooled kids in the U.S., with about 190,000 of them based in California. That number will undoubtedly increase if the virus threat continues for a protracted period – how much so is anyone’s guess. As you contemplate homeschooling your young ones, please consider: your family may wind up a tighter unit and your children more literate. At the same time, they will not be exposed to perverse sex education, bullies, indoctrination, the teachers unions’ archaic tenure and seniority rules, etc.

Think about it.

1322,1801,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-coronavirus-state-department-275139,2020-05-22,Trump administration might consolidate pandemic response at State Department,"The overall effort, first reported by the media platform Devex, is described as the President’s Response to Outbreaks, or PRO.

Under the proposed initiative, the State Department would appoint a coordinator to oversee nearly every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response — from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernized protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak.

“Having a singular initiative to focus global attention and resources has been an effective model to turn the tide of diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria,” reads an outline of the new model that U.S. officials planned to circulate on Capitol Hill. “Through PRO the U.S. will assert global leadership for mobilizing private and public partners, multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors to support a global pandemic response that will deliver results for the American people.”

The proposal comes as senior administration officials grapple with ongoing flaws in the federal government’s response to Covid-19, which has pitted top agencies against each other as they work to secure medical supplies for U.S. stockpiles and other nations, and has often resulted in conflicting guidance from the White House and public health officials.

The plan could decrease USAID’s role by consolidating pandemic preparedness under the State Department, which lacks the volume of supply chain experts, epidemiologists and public health experts on staff at USAID. There also are questions about whether the initiative will focus strictly on infectious disease outbreaks or be expanded to include other types of global health issues.

One USAID official familiar with the proposal described it as a “power-grab” by the State Department. Another called it a “turf fight.”

The State Department declined to comment on “purportedly leaked deliberative documents.” A spokesperson for USAID declined to comment.

Some at USAID questioned whether now is an appropriate time to overhaul the existing response model given the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The number of pandemic-related deaths in the United States is nearing 100,000, and the Trump administration is shifting its focus to a swift reopening of the U.S. economy.

But, according to one USAID official, State Department leaders have been frustrated with USAID’s response to the novel coronavirus, feeling it’s been slow and not always aligned with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s priorities.

Members of the White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, also previously complained about USAID’s distribution of medical supplies to other countries at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, when U.S. hospitals and front-line workers faced shortages of personal protective equipment.

USAID is technically an independent agency, but it is supposed to take policy guidance from the secretary of State, whose department plays a role in USAID’s budget management.

“My read of it is they’re unhappy with USAID,” the USAID official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. “USAID hasn’t been able to deliver on certain things.”

Documents circulated inside the administration were short on details about which programs at USAID could be relocated under the two components of PRO: America’s Response to Outbreaks, and the Preparedness Initiative for Pandemics and Emergency Response. It will differ from programs such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President’s Malaria Initiative, but will incorporate lessons from them, according to an FAQ.

Aside from working on the coronavirus response, Birx — who could not immediately be reached for comment — holds titles including U.S. special representative for global health diplomacy. She’s been based at the State Department, and her duties include dealing with global HIV/AIDS programs, including PEPFAR.

“The goal at this stage is to develop a unified whole-of-government response and approach to pandemics that will allow us to bring together all of our government’s tools to meet the challenges we will face in this new era of pandemics,” one of the documents reads. “As the discussions progress towards implementation, we will clearly define specific roles and responsibilities across agencies, consistent with their mandates.”

According to the proposal, the ARO coordinator would work with government agencies and the private sector “to ensure the full power and expertise of the United States are leveraged to … prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases and mitigate and prepare for future disease outbreaks.”",real

NEW YORK — The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
New coronavirus antibody test highly accurateA new antibody test is highly accurate at determining whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, according to a study published on Friday in The Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine found the test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, had a specificity rate of 99.9% and a sensitivity rate of 100%, suggesting little chance of incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having been infected and virtually no chance of a false negative readout. Abbott's test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA and the company has already shipped more than 10 million of the tests to hospitals and labs. (Links: https://reut.rs/2xIdOdk https://bit.ly/2Lb24U3)
Coronavirus antibodies in breast milk may protect infantsBreast milk from infected mothers may contain antibodies to the novel coronavirus that could be protective for babies, a study suggests. ""Nursing mothers who are infected with the novel coronavirus should continue to breastfeed throughout their COVID-19 illness and beyond, because (other researchers) have shown transmission does not occur via milk, and we have determined that antibodies are almost certainly there, and may protect their babies from infection,"" Rebecca Powell of The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who led the study, told Reuters. Her team's report, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. (https://bit.ly/2WHvJcA)
Hydroxychloroquine fails to show benefit in hospitalized coronavirus patientsIn a large observational study of hospitalized coronavirus patients, hydroxychloroquine - an old malaria drug championed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a ""game changer"" in the fight against the virus - neither lessened patients' need for breathing assistance nor their risk of death, according to a report published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
""We didn't see any association between getting this medicine and the chance of dying or being intubated,"" lead researcher Dr. Neil Schluger, of New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told Reuters. ""The patients who got the drug didn't seem to do any better."" Patients in the study were not randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo, the researchers noted, and so randomized trials, the gold standard for tests of new therapies, should continue. (Links: https://reut.rs/2WHgjoZ https://bit.ly/2SLrAn1 https://bit.ly/2SLrAn1) )
Life-threatening syndrome develops in some children after coronavirus exposureA rare, life-threatening condition is developing in some children after exposure to the new coronavirus that researchers are calling ""Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-19."" Doctors are seeing clusters of children, some very young, with the disorder, which can attack multiple organs, impair heart function and weaken heart arteries. British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and ""significant"" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus. The syndrome, while rare, can rapidly progress to critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. (Links: https://reut.rs/3cj848U https://bit.ly/3cea3LK https://bit.ly/3cea3LK) )
Coronavirus may survive in spermChinese researchers who tested the sperm of 38 men infected with COVID-19 found that six of them, or 16%, had the new coronavirus in their semen, suggesting a small chance that the virus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, could be sexually transmitted, scientists said. Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.
""If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,"" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed. (Links: https://reut.rs/2WhI2h0 https://bit.ly/3bm6JgA )
Poor nasal swab technique may explain some false negative coronavirus testsPart of the reason for some false negative coronavirus tests - tests that do not detect the virus in someone who is actually infected - may be that the test sample was not collected properly by the person using the nasopharyngeal swab, Canadian researchers say. They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen ""requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,"" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say. Their study, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. ( https://bit.ly/2yGKG6J )
Coronavirus spread affected more by public health measures than by climateTemperature and latitude do not appear to be associated with the spread of the novel coronavirus, and humidity levels have only a weak effect, according to data collected in March from 144 regions of the world. By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).
""The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,"" Juni's team concluded in their report. ( https://bit.ly/2YIVmfS )

But newly obtained government documents by a UK-based investigative journalist reveal a much deeper relationship with members of the coup-government-in-waiting.

John McEvoy is an independent journalist who has published in the International History Review, The Canary, Tribune Magazine, Jacobin, Declassified UK, Brasil Wire among other publications. He reported from Venezuela during the coup efforts in 2019, from Colombia during the student protests the same year and from France in 2020 on the Yellow Vests movement and general strike.

Mr McEvoy's main research focus is in contemporary British involvement in Latin America - notably British state intervention and natural resource extraction in Colombia since 1989. He speaks English, Spanish and French.

Sputnik: You recently published an exposé revealing the existence of a secret unit working within the UK Foreign Office that was liaising with elements of the Venezuelan opposition.

What exactly did you discover?

John McEvoy: I discovered a Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) Unit named the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit, which hadn't previously been acknowledged by either the government, the diplomat involved, nor the Venezuelan opposition, with whom the unit has collaborated.

It was also found that Juan Guaidó's representative in the UK, Vanessa Neumann, had spoke with FCO officials about the sustenance of British business interests in Venezuela's 'reconstruction'. Given Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and Neumann's past links with oil corporations, we can only imagine what this means.

Sputnik: Who are the key players in this unit?

John McEvoy: The only diplomat that we know is involved thus far is John Saville, the former UK ambassador to Venezuela between 2014 and 2017. He's been a diplomat for some decades.

Sputnik: Why is this significant, why should this matter to anyone living in Britain?

John McEvoy: It's obviously important for UK citizens to know what is being done in their name - be it at home or abroad. In the case of Venezuela, which is undergoing a serious political and economic crisis, it's important that UK citizens know how the UK government is contributing to this - through sanctions, partnering with the US in trying to destabilise the country, and in planning for the country's 'reconstruction' following an imagined coup.

When you look at the past record of British destabilisation and 'reconstruction' - in Iraq, Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan, for instance - you get the kind of idea of what might await Venezuela should the government be overthrown. But it's not just about a utilitarian approach, it's also about confronting imperialism. What right does the UK government have in the 'reconstruction' of another sovereign nation?

I'm sure the British population would be alarmed if it were to learn that Venezuela had a specialist unit within its Ministry of External Affairs planning for the 'reconstruction' of Britain.

Sputnik: Did the Foreign Office have an explanation for the existence of this unit?

John McEvoy: The FCO responded in a way that has characterised British public diplomacy over recent years: that they're trying to 'help' Venezuelans resolve their 'appalling political and economic crisis'. Even the smallest understanding of British foreign policy, and the history of British interventions abroad, would lead one to immediately suspect this explanation. That's before considering the numerous different ways in which the British government has joined in with the economic strangulation of Venezuela over the past 16 months - notably in freezing over $1bn worth of Venezuelan gold held in the Bank of England.

These sanctions are even more concerning in light of the current coronavirus - Venezuela is struggling to import vital medication for years. What's more, if the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit is so committed to benign objectives such as democracy promotion and political assistance, it's quite a wonder why they kept silent about it since Autumn 2019.

Sputnik: How would you respond to someone who says that it isn't that big a deal for the UK Foreign Office to have a group of people whose job is to liaise with opposition figures in another country?

John McEvoy: Of course it's within the FCO's remit to liaise with foreign politicians and diplomats. In this case, those with whom it is liaising have been trying to violently overthrow their elected government for the past 16 months (and, in the wider context, since Hugo Chavez was first elected in 1998). The most recent instance came to a head this month when US and Venezuelan mercenaries arrived on the Venezuelan coasts with plans to kidnap the president and gun down ""violent colectivos"" - which is frequently a code-word for working class, usually socialist communities in Venezuela who support the legitimacy and sovereignty of their government and state.

In March and April 2019, I stayed with the leader of a colectivo in Caracas, Venezuela, for two weeks. This colectivo was dedicated to helping the local children with cultural events and activities - dance, theatre, art, etc. Yet in the international media, colectivos have been comprehensively painted as violent, thuggish supporters of the Venezuelan government. Painting them as 'thugs' or 'terrorists' provides a pre-emptive justification for attacking supporters of the government and those who defend the sovereignty of the Venezuelan state.

What this [recent mercenary] plan entailed was a possible massacre of the Venezuelans who would inevitably come out in defence of the sovereignty of their state. The contract for this operation reportedly bears Juan Guaidó's signature and he is named as the operation's Commander in Chief - and these plans were underway when Guaidó visited the UK in January 2020. This is, therefore, a unique situation - the UK government is collaborating, at the highest levels, with political forces that are involved in what many would describe as terrorism.

Sputnik: Is there anything about their activities that you still don't know that you want to know?

John McEvoy: Yes - another Freedom of Information request has been sent; hopefully there'll be a follow-up article on this latest piece.

A Chinese doctor who was among the first to blow the whistle on the new coronavirus has died from the disease, the hospital treating him said on social media early Friday local time.

Li Wenliang, 34, an ophthalmologist based in Wuhan, was reprimanded in early January by local police authorities for ""publishing falsehoods"" after he mentioned in a WeChat group seven cases of a virus similar to SARS from a seafood market.

News of Li's death has triggered millions of reactions on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Most posts mourned him, called him a hero and commented with candle emojis, some with mourning poems. When Li was in critical condition late Thursday and early Friday local time, millions of people flocked to a livestream operated by local media outside the hospital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Among the outpouring of grief, some asked for accountability and transparency surrounding his treatment and the larger picture of authorities' response to the virus.

The topics ""Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology"" and ""We want freedom of speech"" soon began to trend on Weibo, before being deleted, CNN reported.

In a now-deleted interview with Beijing Youth Daily in late January, Li said that the report on SARS is not entirely accurate, although he didn't mean to be misleading. He also didn't mean to spread the information widely.

But he was trying to warn his old classmates, many of whom were practicing clinicians. He said he was later infected after treating a female patient with ""unknown pneumonia.""

On his personal Weibo account one week before he died, Li recounted his journey from seeing the coronavirus test result, to being reprimanded by the authorities for disrupting the social order, to being hospitalized.

""I was hospitalized on the 12th. At that time, I was still wondering, 'Why is there no announcement of people-to-people transmission, and why are no medical workers getting infected?'"" he wrote.

He was diagnosed with coronavirus the next day. ""The dust is settled now.""

Li's death has prompted condolences from state media, including the People's Daily and the Global Times.

Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization's emergencies program said, ""We're very sad to hear of the loss of Dr. Li Wenliang. We're very sorry to hear of the loss of any front line worker who's attempted to care for patients. And we ourselves have lost our friends in the front lines. So we should celebrate his life and mourn his death with his colleagues.""

In a letter, the senators cite four workers who were fired after raising concerns about safety conditions at the company’s warehouses. Amazon has disputed that the firings were retaliatory, citing other policy violations.

“Given the clear public history of these four workers’ advocacy on behalf of health and safety conditions for workers in Amazon warehouses preceding their terminations, and Amazon’s vague public statements regarding violations of ‘internal policies,’ we are seeking additional information to understand exactly what those internal policies are,” the senators wrote.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ed Markey (D-MA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) signed the letter.

In late March, Amazon fired Christian Smalls after he organized a walkout at the company’s Staten Island warehouse, JFK8. Amazon claimed Smalls was fired for violating quarantine by attending the walkout, but Smalls was only placed on quarantine after he started calling for greater safety precautions, and other co-workers with far greater exposure to COVID-19 were never placed on quarantine. A memo later obtained by Vice revealed Amazon executives planning to smear Smalls and make him “the face of the entire union/organizing movement.”

“These safety responses have not been sufficient”

On Tuesday, The Verge reported that a worker at JFK8 had died of COVID-19. At least 35 workers at the facility have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to alerts sent to workers. Two other Amazon warehouse workers, both in California, have died of the virus. Amazon workers at over 130 facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, according to alerts tallied by workers. The company has declined to release statistics on infections.

“Amazon has closed some warehouses for 48 hours for deep cleaning after employees test positive for coronavirus,” the senators wrote, “but these safety responses have not been sufficient.”

The letter also cites the firing of Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker in Minnesota who called for greater safety measures. Amazon said he was fired for safety violations and other policy infractions. Workers at other warehouses say social distancing guidelines are being enforced in ways that target workers who raise safety concerns.

Amazon also fired two user experience designers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, after their group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, began organizing an online panel where tech workers could hear from warehouse workers. Hundreds of tech workers subsequently organized a sick-out in protest of the firings and warehouse conditions. Last week, Amazon senior engineer and vice president Tim Bray resigned over the firings of whistleblowers.

Asked about the letter, an Amazon spokesperson disputed that the firings were retaliatory. “These individuals were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but rather, for violating—often repeatedly—policies, such as intimidation, physical distancing and more,” the company said in a statement. “We support every employees’ right to criticize or protest their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We look forward to explaining in more detail in our response to the Senators’ letter.”

The senators are asking Amazon to specify these policies and clarify its process for terminating employees. They’re also asking whether Amazon tracks potential organizing at warehouses, as it does with Whole Foods, or documents which workers participate in walkouts and protests.",real

We must never let this happen because if we do, humanity is dead.

Never let a good crisis go to waste the famous quote goes and it seems that some people are trying to use the COVID-19 pandemic to radically reorganise how we live our lives.

""We can’t go back to how we lived before"" has been common refrain these last few weeks, but while of course not all aspects of life pre-COVID-19 were perfect, it was still a lot more enjoyable than ‘lockdown’ has been. Man is a social animal. Yet in Britain since 23rd March, we’ve basically been prohibited from having a social life.

Most of us have been stuck at home, with the most minimal contact with other human beings outside of our immediate family circle. Most have borne this unnatural state of affairs quite well because they thought it was for the public good. But what is really sinister is that power elites seem to want social distancing measures to continue even after the virus has run its course - which in Britain it already looks to have done.

It’s as if they want to take social atomisation to the next level. ID politics and greed-fuelled neo-liberalism seek to divide us spiritually - now we are to be separated from each other physically.

""I think we all recognise now social distancing is here to stay,"" Priti Patel said on ‘Good Morning Britain’ earlier this week.

Do we, Ms Patel? I certainly don’t, and judging by the criticism your comments received on social media, more people agree with me than they do with you.

She continued ‘Our lives are going to be very different’.

Well, she’s right on one point: a life in which ‘social distancing’ was permanent would be different. It would be hell on earth. Imagine a world in which grandparents couldn’t hug their grandchildren, or in which people couldn’t hug their parents, or closest friends? A world where we could never pat someone on the back, or shake their hands? If social distancing was ‘here to stay’, as Patel seems to want, how are couples ever going to come together? The human species would become extinct within a generation. Or perhaps Patel believes AI is our future? If so, what a chilling prospect.

Never in a million years will I accept this pic.twitter.com/nPDyvPp0qX — Are You Awake Yet (@Joannew68022274) May 14, 2020

​In their paper 'Covid-19 The Downside of Social Distancing,' Professor Ophelia Deroy of Ludwig-Maxmilians University, Munich, and her co-authors point out that the demand for social distancing ‘runs counter to the evolved structure of human cognition.’

And that ‘hazardous conditions - make us more - and not less - social’.

Think back to the moments in your life when you felt most alive. It’s very likely it was when you were close to other people. Perhaps it was when you were at a football match and your team scored in stoppage time to pull off a dramatic victory to win a major tournament.

Or at a pop concert, when you saw your favourite group. Or at a party when you danced till dawn with the man/woman of your dreams? Or perhaps it was when you had a chance encounter with a stranger on a train or a plane, or in a pub or nightclub, one that blossomed into romance.

If ‘social distancing’ becomes the ‘new normal’ none of these experiences would take place. Just about the only new friendships, we could forge would be online ones.

One of the very worst things about the Covid-19 outbreak is the way it has made human beings so wary of each other. OMG! Someone is coming towards me on the pavement, I’d better cross to the other side - I might catch the virus!

The only sane solution to the human condition - as the wisest philosophers throughout the ages have concluded - is love. But ‘social distancing’ is anti-love. It keeps us apart when we should be coming together.

When I messaged him about Priti Patel’s statement on Good Morning Britain’ a good friend of mine replied: ‘This is going to cause a big rise in suicide if it is long term.’ He is of course right. Who indeed would want to live in a world where physical contact with other humans was not allowed?

'No Sex Please, We’re British' was the name of a popular farce back in the 1970s, it would be the reality if we are to keep two metres apart from each other forever.

Alas, it’s not just Priti Patel coming out with such cold, misanthropic statements. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there should be no hugging until a coronavirus vaccine is developed.

But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such a vaccine may never be found. Are we really expected not to embrace anyone for the rest of our lives?

In his 1955 work The Sane Society, the great social scientist Erich Fromm wrote: ‘The danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future was that men may become robots’. How real that threat is now, as politicians and public figures seek to exploit fears about a virus to present anti-human, sociopathic practices as ‘the new normal.’

In fact, there could be nothing more abnormal than what Patel and co are suggesting. If there is any distancing to be done- we need to do it from those who would strip us of our common humanity.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

1362,448,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-outbreak-computer-algorithm-artificial-intelligence/,2020-04-27,The computer algorithm that was among the first to detect the coronavirus outbreak,"When you're fighting a pandemic, almost nothing matters more than speed. A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon ""outbreak science."" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.

It was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.

Almost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.

Dr. Kamran Khan

Half a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 – SARS – kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.

COVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.

Chinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.

It was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.

BlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.

Dr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.

Bill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.

The virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia. Thousands of travelers were heading to the United States too.

Dr. Kamran Khan: Most of the travel came into California and San Francisco and Los Angeles. Uh, also, into New York City. And we analyzed that way back on December 31. Our surveillance system that picked up the outbreak of Wuhan automatically talks to the system that is looking at how travelers might go to various airports around Wuhan.

Bill Whitaker: So when you see that map, you don't just see flight patterns?

Dr. Kamran Khan: If you think of an outbreak a bit like a fire and embers flying off, these are like embers flying off into different locations.

Bill Whitaker: So in this case, that ember landed in dry brush in New York and started a wildfire?

Dr. Kamran Khan: Absolutely.

Dr. Khan told us he had spent the better part of a year persuading the airlines to share their flight data for public health. Nobody had ever asked that before. But he saw it as information gold.

Dr. Kamran Khan: How is it that someone knows 16B - that seat is available, but 14A has been taken? There clearly must be some kind of information system.

Bill Whitaker: Why is that so important?

Dr. Kamran Khan: There are over 4 billion of us that board commercial flights and travel around the world every year. And so that is why understanding population movements becomes so important in anticipating how disease is spread.

Dr. Kamran Khan

The virus spread across Asia with a vengeance. BlueDot has licensed access to the anonymized location data from millions of cellphones. And with that data it identified 12 of the 20 cities that would suffer first.

Dr. Kamran Khan: What we're looking at here are mobile devices that were in Wuhan in the previous 14 days and where are they now across East Asia. Places like Tokyo have a lot of devices, Seoul in South Korea--

Bill Whitaker: So you're following those devices from Wuhan to these other cities?

Dr. Kamran Khan: That's correct. I do wanna point out these are also anonymized data. But they allow us to understand population movements. That is how we can understand how this virus will spread.

To build their algorithm, Dr. Khan told us he deliberately hired an eclectic mix: engineers, ecologists, geographers, veterinarians all under one roof. They spent a year teaching the computer to detect 150 deadly pathogens.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can ultimately train a machine to be reading through all the text and picking out components that this is talking about an outbreak of anthrax and this is talking about the heavy metal band Anthrax. And as you do this thousands and thousands and thousands of times, the machine starts to get smarter and smarter.

Bill Whitaker: And how many different languages does the computer understand?

Dr. Kamran Khan: So it's reading this currently in 65 languages, and processing this information every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. So it's a lotta data to go through.

Within two hours of detecting the outbreak on December 31, BlueDot had sent a warning of the potential threat to its clients: public health officials in 12 countries, airlines and frontline hospitals, like Humber River in Toronto.

Dr. Michael Gardam: We've been able to really make a lot of decisions, I think, a little bit earlier 'cause I kinda feel like we had a bit of an inside scoop here.

One of Canada's top infectious disease physicians, Dr. Michael Gardam, told us it was like getting real time intelligence.

Bill Whitaker: What did you do when you got that information from BlueDot?

Dr. Michael Gardam: Getting that intel allowed me to kinda be the canary in the coal mine, to stand up and say we need to pay attention to this. And to start thinking about it, start thinking about supplies, start thinking about how busy we might be.

Dr. Michael Gardam

Dr. Michael Gardam: Now at this point, everybody knows about CoVid-19. But it's, it's not so much now. Now you've pretty much bought whatever PPE you can buy, it's very hard to buy that anymore. It's what did you do a month and a half ago that was so important. So, none of this is any surprise to us whatsoever, and yet, you see countries around the world where this has been a surprise.

BlueDot had no clients in the U.S., so while Dr. Gardam's hospital was making plans in January, President Trump, as late as March, was still assuring Americans that everything was under control.

California wasn't so sure, and braced for the worst. In March, it became the first state in the country to lock down its cities. Mickey Mouse suddenly looked lonely, drivers had only dreamed of such empty freeways. But the lock-down bought time. Despite having its first case of COVID-19 five weeks before New York, California dodged the hurricane of infection that slammed into New York City. At his daily teleconference in Sacramento, Governor Gavin Newsom made no secret where he'd gotten his edge: outbreak science.

Governor Gavin Newsom

Gavin Newsom: It's not a gross exaggeration when I say this – the old modeling is literally pen–to-paper in some cases. And then you put it into some modest little computer program and it spits a piece of paper out. I mean, this is a whole other level of sophistication and data collection.

With the virus spreading around the world, California enlisted the help of BlueDot, Esri, Facebook and others, using mapping technologies and cell phone data to predict which hospitals would be hit hardest, and see if Californians were really staying at home. Data became California's all-seeing crystal ball.

Gavin Newsom: We are literally seeing in to the future and predicting in real-time based on constant update of information where patterns are starting to occur before they become headlines.

Bill Whitaker: Can you just sort of like, give me an example?

Gavin Newsom: We can see in real time on a daily basis, hourly basis, moment-by-moment basis if necessary, whether or not our stay-at-home orders were working. We can truly track now by census tract, not just by county.

Here's what it looked like. BlueDot scanned anonymous cell phone data over a 24-hour period last month in Los Angeles. The blue circles indicate less movement than the week before, the red spots show where people are still gathering. It could be a hospital – or a problem. That cellphone data allows public health officials to investigate. It also raises worrisome privacy issues.

Bill Whitaker: How are you able to ensure that this cell phone data will remain anonymous?

Gavin Newsom: Well, I didn't want to take the companies' words for it, I say that respectfully. I have a team of folks that are privacy-first advocates in our Technology Department. And we are making sure that no individualized data is provided. If it is, we're out.

Bill Whitaker: So what's been the most frustrating part of this for you?

Gavin Newsom: It's just incumbent upon us to have a national lens. And to recognize we're

many parts but one body. And if one part suffers, we all suffer.

Bill Whitaker: From this experience, do you think the Federal Government needs to overhaul the way it tackles pandemics?

Gavin Newsom: I don't know that there's a human being out there, maybe one or two, that would suggest otherwise. No, the absolute answer is, of course, unequivocally.

Dylan George: Data technology has transformed the way we do business in many aspects of our lives. But it has not transformed the way things are done in public health.

Dylan George

For Dylan George that's an urgent priority. As a scientist tracking biological threats in the Bush and Obama administrations, he has seen first-hand what he calls the panic-neglect cycle.

Dylan George: Perhaps the most tragic idea in all of public health is this: in a time of an outbreak everyone lights their hair on fire and is running around trying to figure out. After it's over, everyone forgets about it

He has joined a growing number of scientists pressing to revive an old idea: an infectious disease forecasting center modeled on the National Weather Service.

Dylan George: We need to have professionals that their day job is dedicated to helping us understand how infectious diseases will-- will risk our well being economically and from a national security perspective.

Bill Whitaker: That idea has been kicking around for a while. It's never gotten the funding. Do you think things will be different this time?

Dylan George: When we see that there is $2 trillion being spent on stimulus bills to help us get out of this, to make sure that we can rebound, we need to think transformatively. We need to think broadly about how we can move these things forward. This kind of a center would help us do that.

As the coronavirus continues to upend our lives, Toronto's Dr. Michael Gardam told us he has seen the difference a digital early-warning system can make.

Dr. Michael Gardam: One of the biggest challenges in infectious diseases is you never wanna be the doctor that picks up the first case because you're probably going to miss it. And you probably weren't wearing the right gear and it's probably already spread in your hospital. And so getting the early warning that help gives you the intel to make that first call is so incredibly important.

The researchers worked around the clock, in shifts of three to five hours, hoping to stave off weariness and keep their minds sharp for the delicate task.
They set up lines of laboratory volunteers: medical residents, postdoctoral students, even experienced veterans of science, each handling a specific task. They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is.
For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.
These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws.
The research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic.
Surveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent.
The idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.
Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work.
But these tactics mean nothing if the test results can’t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them.
Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best.
The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.
It is also the result on which scientists are most divided.“There are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project’s leaders. “That’s some reason for optimism.”
Dr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent.
“Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.”
The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”
Dr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns.
“I think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason.
As universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.
Dr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality.
In mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too.
“I realized, ‘Gosh this is really the Wild West,’” Dr. Hsu said. “We needed to figure out which of these would really work.”
The duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations.
The team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals.
They also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night.
In all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable.
Suited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line.
One researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night.
In the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco.
The Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests.
Having a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said.
Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives.
A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said.
The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said.
The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity.
“You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however.
The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.”
Rapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results — which appear as bands on a test strip — a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests.
“If you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,” Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. “That is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.”
The team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero.
Perhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands — the ones most likely to be erroneous — their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team’s estimate of 87 percent.
Other experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. “That’s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,” said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Dr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test’s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, “but I would not make any decisions based on that.”
Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.
But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said.
Scanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use.
In the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent.
Dr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita’s test and not the “newer, improved version” his company had ordered. “It will be interesting to see how it performs,” he said.
Dr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions.
“This is just the beginning,” Dr. Marson said. “Our goal would be to keep going till we feel there’s adequate supply in the market.”",real

“Going through an airport, the whole travel experience, will be as enjoyable as open-heart surgery,” Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths recently told Bloomberg, adding that precautionary measures like personal protective equipment and social distancing restrictions can only be short-term solutions while waiting on a vaccine.

“This crisis is unlike anything we've ever seen in the aviation business,” he added. “We're dealing with a monster.”

In the meantime, many airlines have intensified aircraft cleaning, using electrostatic sprayers and a host of other measures. They have introduced new boarding procedures and are blocking middle seats to promote social distancing.

""Safety will no longer be limited to flight safety but personal safety as well,'' Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview on CNBC last month. ""We've doubled down – in fact, tripled down – on sanitation and hygiene (and) cleanliness.""

The new normal? U.S. airlines announce requirements for passengers to wear face masks

All major U.S. airlines and an increasing number of airports now require passengers to wear masks or other face coverings. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas became the first airport last week to introduce vending machines selling personal protective equipment including face masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and wipes.

JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes told CNBC last month that some of those temporary measures airlines are currently taking, such as asking travelers to wear masks, might become permanent policies.

Bastian concurred, predicting that new permanent in-flight changes to promote social distancing could include new seating plans, fewer passengers per flight and immunity passports.

""Just as with 9/11, I definitely think we're going to see some things here change for good,"" Hayes said.

1374,135,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21184344/coronavirus-covid-19-fashion-influencers-street-photography-instagram,2020-03-23,Fashion influencers are rethinking their curated aesthetics because they can’t leave their houses,"Elizabeth Savetsky, an influencer who lives in New York, has kept her Instagram feed pristine up until now. In every past photo, she wears an enviable outfit with perfectly done hair and, occasionally, her smiling, tall plastic surgeon husband. They’re photos that make people wish they could live in her shoes. But things are changing now that she’s stuck at home because of social distancing: she can’t hire photographers, she isn’t attending events, and she’s dressing up for no one other than her family. Her posts are starting to reflect this new reality.

For the first time, Savetsky recorded herself singing, surprising her followers who likely had no idea she had a good voice. Last week, she posted a selfie showing off her natural, wavy hair and minimal makeup (though she did later delete it). Her most recent posts are one of her on the couch surrounded by snacks and an old photo with her mom in which she laments the days when they could hang.

Fashion influencers’ accounts might never be the same after the pandemic ends, and it’s already forcing them to adjust how they make content and what they post. Sure, they’re still receiving swag in the mail to produce unboxing and try-on videos, but they’re also grappling with the pandemic themselves and figuring out how their accounts should look. Do people still want to see cute outfits during a recession? How do you take a studio-quality photo when the only photographer available to you is your husband? What happens when you feel mentally and emotionally exhausted? The curated aesthetic people have railed against — which has defined much of Instagram up until now — might slowly disappear.

“It’s going to force us to be more creative,” Savetsky says. “I’ve been posting on Instagram for about seven years now, and so it’s nice to almost have this challenge that’s forcing me outside the box because we all tend to get into these habits of doing the same thing over and over again, shooting on the same street corner always, and we can’t do that anymore.”

Influencers hope to keep working with clothing brands, although those brands might shift from advertising going out attire to leggings or comfortable clothes. The photos they take are also going to be more off the cuff with minimal backdrops and whatever they can work with at home. The professional photographers are going away, too, as are the studios they rent to shoot.

The business will go on, though. Katie Sands, another influencer who runs both an Instagram account and fashion blog, sees the pandemic as an opportunity to have more honest, personality-driven conversations.

“I have had a bunch of followers reach out and say, ‘What do you think is going to happen to the blogosphere? Do you think blogging industry will go away?’ and I, personally, think it’s actually the opposite,” Sands says. “I think that it’s going to become stronger than ever. People, including myself, I’m looking to the creators I follow for different inspiration — for home recipes, for workouts, for work from home outfits, for beauty advice.”

Her Stories now include videos in which she dances with her dad because she’s social distancing in her parents’ home. She also tapes her boyfriend trying on swag she’s sent. Her videos are clearly made in her house. Sands is also going live on her page every Thursday with her therapist to help other people work through the stress and anxiety of a pandemic. One of her most recent posts is a video of her dancing in a kitchen, her phone clearly propped up against something. It’s not bad-looking, but it’s different than older photos of her laughing with friends or dressed up at a party, posing for a photographer.

Fashion influencers’ photos often look good because they hire professionals to help them shoot. That’s not the case while social distancing. Another influencer, Charlotte Bickley, says her mom now doubles as her photographer and will shoot her photos while they’re isolated in Florida.

“Obviously in this time everyone understands that they’re not going to be the most glamorous shots,” she says.

She also polled her followers on how they felt about her posting brand deals during this time, and the majority said they felt comfortable with it. “I do feel a little weird doing superficial things right now, just personally, I know my followers want to see it,” she says. “But I do feel a little weird to be honest.”

The logistics of those brand deals also have to be renegotiated. Sands says one of her agreements specifically requires her to take street photos, which she’s unable to do because of quarantine restrictions. Her brand partners are also putting deals on pause while they figure out their own strategies, which she understands, but it also means her income is limited.

“Like everyone else, my business has been hit so hard,” Sands says. “When the brands don’t want to do the partnership, when I’ve already allocated them into my monthly budget, it’s hard,”.

Sands says most brands have been receptive to hearing alternative ideas, like posting on Stories rather than the grid or finding a way to make the messaging cater to the situation at hand. Brands that aren’t on board are told to talk to her agent, she says. Still, she’s hoping she’ll be able to go back to posting more regularly this week. (Last week, she did promote a vitamin company in both her grid and Stories, angling it around the pandemonium COVID-19 has created.)

Granted, if the pandemic slows down and social distancing is lifted in only a few months, these influencers’ honest glimpses into their lives might go away, too. Followers will have gotten only a momentary peek into their favorite influencers’ actual lives.

“We’re in a serious time and it’s creating serious conversation,” Savetsky says. “I see a lot of my influencer friends going deeper than they usually would and posting different kinds of content. It’s going to change the industry for the better and make it less-curated and make it more relationship-based with influencer to follower.”",real

Workers from the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) say they are terrified of violent males from so-called ‘safe countries’ who have little chance of obtaining legal residence but instead claim to be underage minors and thus qualify for protections afforded to child foreign nationals.

“Often these Moroccans, Tunisians, and Algerians are not minors at all, but have false papers with them. Or no papers at all,” a COA employee told Dagblad van het Noorden.

“They are then assured that they will at least have shelter until the age of 18. They just try and often they succeed.”

The migrants engage in a variety of crimes, including theft and robbery, and exchange their plunder in transactions that can often turn chaotic.

“They destroy things, fight over them and steal everything that's loose,"" one worker said. ""They have absolutely no respect for us or COA.""

“These are hardened street criminals who have nothing to lose. We’re waiting for the first incident where an employee gets a knife in the belly.”

COA employees are reportedly forbidden from speaking to media without authorization, but an increasing number of anonymous whistleblowers are coming forward to sound the alarm.

“Many of our colleagues are despondent and fearful of this group,” a COA worker said.

“When we talk to them about something, we are immediately ‘racists.’ That's what they immediately call them. That hurts, because we try to do our best for refugees.”

A new report on crimes committed by foreigners in the Netherlands revealed a stunning 30 percent increase of incidents in asylum centers, with citizens of the aforementioned ‘safe countries’ implicated in roughly one-third of total cases.

The impact of the findings is compounded by the fact that the number of migrants staying in asylum centers has reportedly fallen drastically over the past five years, from 47,7000 in 2015 to 27,000 in 2019.

Precipitation in the Holy Land in general, and the level of the Sea of Galilee in particular have long been thoroughly studied, a report by Haaretz suggests, detailing current excavation efforts in an area called el-Araj, a historic spot where events depicted in the Bible allegedly unfolded.

After several years of drought, whole parts of el-Araj are now sitting in water due to this year’s inundation, with the relatively higher points resembling tiny islands purported to be concealing real historic treasures.

The beyond normal precipitation has reportedly suspended excavation efforts originally slated for early summer 2020, which is projected to also be marked by the continuing coronavirus crisis and lockdowns.

“At the moment, the water is 80 centimetres [2 feet, 7 inches] above the mosaic of the Byzantine church, which was built 500 years after Jesus’ time”, archaeologist Motti Aviam pointed out, adding that researchers have tentatively identified the structure as the Church of the Apostles, which Christian tradition says was built over the home of Jesus’ disciples Peter and Andrew in the village of Bethsaida.

They came to believe it was a church by, among other things, gilded glass mosaic, known to have been typically used in wall mosaics in churches as well as fragments of the chancel screen. Also, it is the only Byzantine church found so far that is in line with the description given by a Bavarian bishop named Willibald who reportedly toured the Holy Land in the year 725.

Meanwhile, El-Araj, also known as Beit Habek, is just one of the candidates for the site of the ancient Jewish fishing village of Bethsaida, mentioned in the New Testament as the birthplace of three of Jesus’ disciples. The other major competitor is et-Tell, a little further north of el-Araj on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee.

The excavation there is being led by the archaeologist Professor Rami Arav of the University of Nebraska at Omaha. According to Arav, historical documents say that Bethsaida existed from the late Hellenistic period – in particular, in the first half of the first century, when his geologists say el-Araj was covered by water, as it is now, “Philip the son of Herod granting the old village rights of a Greek polis, and Jesus, were all in the first half of the first century, not the second half”, Arav was quoted as saying.

In the not so distant past, the site of el-Araj housed the “winter palace”, or Beit Habek – a two-storey building dating back to the Ottoman era.

After it was blown up in December 1955 by Israeli paratroopers, the ancient ruins survived the attack and for the last four years have been under archaeological exploration by the Kinneret College archaeological institute, run by Aviam, and Prof. R. Steven Notley of Nyack College, New York.",fake

Weedmaps, which supplies several cannabis dispensaries across Illinois (including Chicago, has created “Higher Together: Sessions from Home,” where notable musicians, DJs, comedians and other influencers perform exclusive sets from their homes and debut new content via live stream.

Their plan is to celebrate 4/20 — the unofficial holiday for cannabis consumers — in all four U.S. continental time zones at 4:20 p.m. Monday.

Wiz Khalifa, Billy Ray Cyrus, Ari Lennox, Joey “CoCo” Diaz, Berner, Stephen Marley, Cam’ron, The Alchemist and others are among the creatives who are scheduled to participate in what Weedmaps calls the “world’s biggest 4/20 virtual celebration.”

Cyrus plans to debut his new single “Hillbilly Ray,” along with an accompanying animated music video, as part of his exclusive acoustic set.

“For more than 12 years, Weedmaps has connected millions of consumers with retailers and brands, while advocating for accessible cannabis for all,” Juanjo Feijoo, Weedmaps’ CEO said in a statement. “We’re excited to partner with some of the best in music and entertainment to celebrate the plant and the culture with our community.”

While the virtual concert has a celebration aspect, the event is also a means to raise funds for Weedmaps’ event partner, The Last Prisoner Project, a Denver-based coalition of cannabis industry leaders that aims to bring restorative justice to the cannabis industry and those jailed for marijuana offenses — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Our constituents, many of whom are over the age of 60 and have underlying health conditions, are ‘imprisoned’ because of a plant that has now been deemed an ‘essential’ service by jurisdictions across the country,” said Sarah Gersten, Last Prisoner Project’s executive director and general counsel in a statement. “Releasing cannabis prisoners now is not only the right thing to do from a justice perspective, but also to ensure the health and safety of all of us.”

“While we are not going to share the details of any specific child in our care, there have been 37 confirmed positive diagnoses to date,” Heartland Alliance spokeswoman Mailee Garcia said.

“We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption.”

Garcia said the prognosis for the children “is very good,” adding that the nonprofit “aggressively moved to obtain testing for all of the children in our care — even those who are asymptomatic.”

Heartland Alliance operates three dormitory-like shelters for unaccompanied immigrant youth in the city, ranging from infants to 17 years old.

Garcia said only one shelter has reported positive cases of the coronavirus. Children who tested positive have been isolated, while employees are also being screened for COVID-19 symptoms prior to each shift. A professional cleaning company has been hired to sanitize the facilities, Garcia said.

ProPublica Illinois first reported the positive cases of the virus at the shelter Monday. ProPublica reported that two staff members have also tested positive.

According to an internal staff email reviewed by ProPublica, the first positive cases of the virus came to light Friday at Heartland’s shelter in Bronzeville. The total number of cases had risen to 19 by the end of the weekend.

As of Monday, the Office of Refugee Resettlement — the federal agency that places unaccompanied migrant children in shelters across the country — said it had identified 21 cases of COVID-19 across all of its partner facilities.

Those cases were reported “in two Texas programs, and one Illinois program,” according to the agency, making the outbreak at Heartland’s shelter the largest of its kind in the country.

The Sun-Times reported in June 2018 that Heartland Alliance was sheltering children who had been separated from their parents at the southern border. The Trump administration said last April it could take up to two years to reunite all of those families.

In a statement released Monday, the National Immigrant Justice Center, a branch of Heartland Alliance, said the Trump administration has “obstructed” the release of unaccompanied migrant children to their family members and sponsors.

“[The Office of Refugee Resettlement] must immediately release as many children as possible, and allow them to reunite with caretakers in homes where they can safely follow local governments’ shelter-in-place guidelines,” the justice center said.

Citing new health guidelines issued during the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has deported more than 400 unaccompanied migrant children intercepted at the border since March 21, according to Reuters.

Then life changed in an instant.

The coronavirus pandemic prompted a statewide stay-at-home order, forcing adjustments to their out-of-the-house routines.

Lee-Ann Millas’ boys, 5 and 9, who have been practicing martial arts for the last six months at a studio in Evergreen Park, haven’t missed a beat. The switch to virtual tae kwon do training has “been a blessing.”

“It’s the only normalcy they’ve been able to have besides being at home,” Millas said.

Grandmaster Kwan Pil Kim teaches tae kwon do and hapkido in Evergreen Park. His classes are usually filled with students ranging in age from 4 to 76, but now he’s forced to perform his techniques in front of a laptop.

“At the beginning, I had a hard time because it was the first time using,” Kim said. “But after a couple of days, it was easier to join for everybody.”

He first started teaching his classes March 14 via Zoom and quickly noticed an issue with teaching martial arts techniques through a camera.

“I was confused in the beginning because [the video] is mirroring, so when I use my left hand they are using their right hand,” Kim said.

Despite the early kinks, classes have gone smoothly since the early days of the experiment, he said.

He teaches every day, following his regular class schedule. He’s even figured out a way for parents to make up for the lack of training equipment.

“I showed them how to make a kicking paddle with a plastic bag,” Kim said. “Put some air in [the bag] and tie it. That was fun.”

His biggest issue now is making sure his youngest students stay focused throughout the session.

“I have to keep them focused because everyone is at home and just looking at the screen,” Kim said.

Millas said the virtual training gives her sons “something to look forward to every day.”

“I think it’s a wonderful thing that not only is he doing for a community, but for the sanity of the kids and parents,” she said.

Kim said the online-only experience has been eye-opening for him, and he didn’t realize how easy it would be to get used to.

“It’s really cool, and especially right now it’s the only thing we can do. We have to teach new stuff, but it’s fun,” Kim said.

Rebecca Caliendo, a yoga instructor, is also holding virtual classes. She believes staying active is as beneficial for mental health as it is for physical health, especially for those who feel bombarded by coronavirus news.

“It’s not bad to feel anxiety or fear … but that has to go somewhere,” Caliendo said. “You need to let them out somehow and doing anything; walking, jumping jacks, yoga. I think that helps people.”

Caliendo started practicing yoga when she lived in New York and she sang opera for a living.

“It’s a crazy place to be. And I needed to discharge, I needed a mental health release,” she said. “I started practicing yoga, which I say kind of saved my sanity, saved my life.”

Before the statewide measure was put into place, Caliendo was holding classes in studios and gyms. She decided to take a stab at doing it online because she missed teaching and realized people were looking for their own way to discharge.

“It’s really cool because it’s physical. But then you also get to chill and relax at the end,” she said.

Caliendo’s classes are free, but she does accept donations.

She teaches all levels five days a week, with her largest class to date at 25 participants. A recent class featured a woman in her 70s who was trying yoga for the first time.

Caliendo said the meditative aspects of a yoga routine are especially helpful right now because instructors can’t adjust their students’ bodies into the right positions.

For fitness instructor Mary Younger, quarantine life has presented an opportunity for her to branch out into the digital space, a move she put off for too long.

“I’ve had a lot of people over the years ask me if I have a tape that I could sell or a DVD,” she said. “This coronavirus era has forced me to do what people have been asking me to do in the first place.”

A couple of days before the stay-at-home order was announced, Younger experimented with her first couple of streams.

“I did a 30-minute step aerobics class and did a 30-minute cardio kickboxing class. The feedback was awesome. I mean, it was great.”

Encouraged by the responses, Younger increased her online workouts. Now she streams her routines three times a week on Facebook live.

The frustrating part, she says, is not being able to feed off of the energy of her students or motivate those who need a little encouragement during a workout.

But the benefits of staying active when you’re cooped up inside outweigh any inconveniences, Younger said.

“I don’t care how wonderful your apartment or your house is with a great balcony and backyard,” she said. “Staying fit is a positive distraction. With all this going on, it makes you feel good about yourself to take care of yourself.”",real

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK today announced it is launching a new livestream show “Just the FAQs LIVE: Conversations about Coronavirus” on Facebook to answer people’s most pressing questions about COVID-19. The live conversation will also feature Gannett journalists, reporting from across the country and providing their local communities with trusted news and information amid the coronavirus outbreak.

“Just the FAQs LIVE: Conversations about Coronavirus” is hosted by Megan Finnerty, founder and director of the Storytellers Project and Storytellers Brand Studio at Gannett. The live episodes will run roughly 30 minutes and will include a round-robin report bringing together local Gannett journalists to share what is happening in their communities and an established thought leader or expert to share insights on COVID-19. Additionally, each week, a conversation topic will be selected based on the most-asked questions of the week sourced from USA TODAY reader questions and Local Facebook Groups. The show will be livestreamed on the USA TODAY Facebook page, as well as many of Gannett’s local media pages.

USA TODAY NETWORK is launching two additional shows in partnership with Facebook that will focus on COVID-19 news and information. “Just the FAQs: Coronavirus Explained,” part of USA TODAY NETWORK’s flagship explainer series, will tackle the biggest coronavirus news of the week and distill it with explanatory graphics, videos and photos. Each explainer episode will also include an on-camera briefing from a USA TODAY NETWORK journalist who will dig deep into the issue that is the subject of the episode. “Just the FAQs: Coronavirus Recap,” will feature clips of the most salient points made by guests of the livestream show. The two shows can be viewed at www.usatoday.com/justthefaqs and on Facebook.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hailed the ""100% accurate"" test as a ""game-changer"" for lifting lockdown restrictions.

Someone can be re-infected with coronavirus within six months, research suggests, in a development that will crush advocates for ""immunity passports"", which theoretically allow bearers to demonstrate they’ve recovered from the illness.

Between 1985 and 2020, University of Amsterdam researchers tested 10 men for four types of coronaviruses which cause the common cold at either three month or six month intervals. Most participants - aged 27 - 66 - caught the viruses again within three years, with the study concluding ""coronavirus protective immunity is short-lasting"" and high antibody levels ""were never sustained at the next visit"".

""We saw frequent reinfection after 12 months post infection and substantial reduction in antibody levels as soon as six months post-infection. It was recently suggested that recovered individuals should receive a so-called 'immunity passport' which would allow them to relax social distancing measures and provide governments with data on herd immunity levels in the population. However, as protective immunity may be lost by six months post-infection, the prospect of reaching functional herd immunity by natural infection seems very unlikely,” the study states.

A study at the University of Amsterdam found that those who survived the coronavirus could become reinfected within six months https://t.co/MuRZNA69IB — Faytuks News 🔴 (@Faytuks) May 23, 2020

​In other words, the conclusion casts doubt on the reliability of so-called ""immunity passports"", which would be issued to people who’ve already overcome COVID-19 infection and test positive for antibodies, and is based on the assumption they’re immune as a result.

The World Health Organisation has previously urged governments not to use ""immunity passports"" for easing lockdown simply because they have antibodies for COVID-19 - nonetheless, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced plans for antibody certificates 21st May, on the basis of results of research which showed at least five percent of people in the UK have now developed COVID-19 antibodies and at least 17 percent of Londoners have them. Hancock further announced the NHS will roll out coronavirus antibody tests following agreements between Whitehall and pharmaceutical firms Roche and Abbott, starting with health care workers, patients and care home residents as of week commencing 1st June. It could take up to 28 days after infection before the test can confirm if a person has or has had the virus.

John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has previously warned studies of other coronaviruses suggest ""potentially bad news"" for hopes of immunity to the virus being developed in humans on a long-term basis.",fake

As Senate Republicans try to push through a $1.8 trillion coronavirus relief bill this week, they are doing so without a handful of votes in the closely divided chamber: Sens. Rand Paul, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee.

Thank you Mr. President! https://t.co/GIsaQTbgQU — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 23, 2020

That's after Kentucky's Sen. Paul, 57, revealed on Sunday that he had tested positive for the virus and Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, both of Utah, said they had recent contact with Paul, but showed no symptoms. All three are now in self-quarantine.

A statement from Romney's office said: ""He has no symptoms but will be tested.""

Senator Romney’s office issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/tBSx03ZlTr — Senator Mitt Romney (@SenatorRomney) March 22, 2020

In a separate statement, Lee said he also showed no symptoms or other risk factors and that he had been advised that a test for the virus ""was not warranted.""

Lee, 48 and Romney, 73, are both expected to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Other senators, including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., have previously self-quarantined as a precautionary measure.

Because the Senate has no provision for remote voting, the absence of the three puts additional strain on Senate Republicans to garner the votes necessary to pass the relief bill — legislation aimed at an injection of cash into the economy — including direct payments of $1,200 to most Americans and $350 billion in loans to small businesses in an effort to save jobs. Even so, Rand and Lee were among eight Republicans who voted against the package in an earlier vote.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blocked a vote on the stimulus bill late Thursday, saying it did not go far enough.

Last week, The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Paul was present at an event on March 7 where two individuals who attended later tested positive for the coronavirus. The newspaper said several of the attendees had subsequently self-quarantined.

Paul's father, the former member of Congress and presidential candidate Ron Paul, who like his son is also a physician, wrote recently suggesting that the epidemic could be ""a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit — financially or politically — from the ensuing panic.""",real

Many companies that cater to creative fields have opened up resources for those currently stuck at home, and last week Nikon made its entire curriculum of online photography classes free until the end of April.

For its part, Olympus has launched “Home With Olympus Sessions” to connect people with Olympus technical experts. Photographers can sign up for group or one-on-one sessions to ask specific questions, get feedback, and learn more about their Olympus cameras from home. The group sessions are capped at six people and are themed around particular camera models and types of photography, like landscape, macro, and underwater. There’s limited space so if you’re interested, head over to Olympus’ website to sign up.

Meanwhile, Leica is rolling out a series of free online discussions led by renowned photographers, musicians, actors, and other creatives. The talks will happen over the next few weeks and kick off on April 12th. Photographers Jennifer McClure and Juan Cristóbal Cobo will speak about sustaining their photography while on self-quarantine, Maggie Steber will talk about her Guggenheim-winning project the “Secret Garden of Lily LaPalma,” and Stephen Vanasco will go into his digital workflow.

You’ll need to register on Eventbrite in order to attend the virtual talks. DJ D Nice, Jeff Garlin, and Danny Clinch are also set to give talks in the near future, but registration for those sessions hasn’t opened up yet.",real

It's powwow season — the time of year when across the country, Native American tribes should be getting together to celebrate their culture with food, dancing, singing and drumming. Kay Oxendine is a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribe in North Carolina.

""Every year we know it's coming; like, the birds sing differently,"" she told NPR. ""It's almost like spring arrives when the powwow does.""

Oxendine is an author and educator and the mistress of ceremonies for a number of powwows in the eastern U.S. It's a job she loves: telling stories to the crowd and introducing the dancers, singers and drummers. She was set to be the first woman to emcee her tribe's powwow, scheduled for Friday, April 17, to Sunday April 19, at the Tribal Ceremonial Grounds in Hollister, N.C.

About 5,000 people would've been there, but she knew it would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. What she says she didn't expect was that her mind and body were still expecting the celebration.

""So I wake up on Friday morning and it's like I wake up and I open my eyes and I'm looking, oh, my God, it's here! Literally was like a kid. And I jumped out of bed, and I'm like YAY, and I said to my son, it's powwow time. And he was like, 'Mom.' ""

She felt physically ill.

""I actually threw up. I actually I got physically ill. It felt like I was pregnant but couldn't give birth.""

Then, she says she noticed on Facebook that a member of the Haliwa Saponi Tribal Council had scheduled a virtual Haliwa powwow. ""And I'm like, man, you know, stop, what are you doing?"" It seemed like such a strange idea.

But she says it was wonderful ""because what she did, she encouraged people to still dress in their regalia. And so one of our previous tribal administrators, Archie Lynch, who is also my cousin, he lit a fire and he was out there and he had sage. He was blessing the grounds. It was in his backyard. But, you know, it just meant the world to me.""

Following the powwow, there's normally an after party with a deejay. This year, one of the tribal members held a virtual after party.

""We were brought up on Otis Redding and soul music around here — music that just makes you want to get up and dance,"" she says.

So Oxendine got up and danced.

""I'm sitting in my room, the music is blasting. I'm sitting in front of my computer, I'm dancing in my living room. My son thinks I've lost my mind. ""

It was just what her spirit needed.

""It was it was just the most beautiful thing I think I've ever encountered. It helped me. It really helped me heal a lot.""",real

When the novel coronavirus was deemed a pandemic in mid-March, I was halfway to New York from South Carolina to start an internship on the social media team at Insider Inc., the parent company of Business Insider. Suddenly, the concern I felt over first-day jitters and settling into my new team was superseded by questions like ""How long will this crisis last?"" and ""Will I ever make it into the office?""

My first weeks on the job as a fellow (the title used by paid interns on a six-month program at Insider) consisted of navigating the onboarding process in a completely remote setting and doing meet-and-greets with colleagues I would possibly never get the chance to know in person.

Other automakers reported big dips in sales earlier this week as the quarter came to a close, though losses are expected to be even more brutal in the second quarter as more of the world stays at home in an effort to suppress the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tesla delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020, according to the release. That’s down from its best sales quarter ever at the end of 2019, where Tesla delivered around 112,000 vehicles. But it’s not nearly as low as the 63,000 the company shipped one year ago in the first quarter of 2019, and it beats out most estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as those from some of Tesla’s biggest supporters.

Production did not taper off, either, despite the shutdowns. Tesla says it has made 102,672 cars so far this year, the second most in a financial quarter for the company. Overall, it was the company’s best first quarter ever when it comes to production and sales figures.

The company beat most Wall Street estimates

Tesla partially attributed the higher-than-expected numbers to the “record levels of production” from the new Gigafactory in Shanghai, China. This was the first full quarter that the new factory was up and running, though it did shut down for around two weeks in February in compliance with a coronavirus-related order from the government, which Tesla said was one of a number of “significant setbacks” it faced. It’s not clear exactly how much of a boost it received, though, as Tesla doesn’t separate out sales and production figures by region.

Tesla has kept making deliveries in the US despite shutting down production at its Fremont, California factory, and it also started delivering the Model Y — its fifth electric vehicle — this quarter as well. The company is coming off its best year ever; Tesla sold more cars in 2019 than it did in the two previous years combined, largely thanks to the strength of the Model 3, which it started shipping to Europe and China at the start of the year.

CEO Elon Musk had warned all the way back in the middle of last year that the beginning of 2020 would be “tough” for Tesla, well before anyone knew that the world would be battling a pandemic. During a call with analysts in July 2019, Musk said “Q1 [2020] will be tough. Q2 will be not as bad, but still tough.” After that, he said, he expected the third and fourth quarters of 2020 to be “incredible.”

Both he and Tesla’s chief financial officer have warned that the company’s sales tend to drop at the beginning of each year due to “seasonality” in the market, but they pick back up by spring. The company saw some of this impact last year when it suffered one of its worst financial losses in history on those 63,000 deliveries. But that delivery drop was also the result of the company running into logistical nightmares as it started shipping the Model 3 to Europe and China for the first time.",real

SUMMARY: One thing that makes the lockdowns difficult is that most Americans don't feel like we're doing anything to help. A horrifying statistic that shows how many restaurant workers have been whacked by this crisis—and how little the government has done to help. A former prosecutor, a Democrat, is skeptical of the sexual assault claim against Biden. Should cities just ban cars on some streets forever? And, your mail!

Do you feel useless? You're not alone.

One of the hardest things about the pandemic is that it's difficult for most of us to be useful.

Some people are finding spectacular ways to help — doctors and farmers and nursing home attendants, and also garage entrepreneurs 3-D printing masks.

But for most us, the primary obligation during this period has been stasis. We've been told that the best way to help is to do nothing.

There's a wonderful new Caitlin Flanagan essay in the Atlantic about how her father lost his college years when World War II broke out. He joined the Navy. The world turned upside down, and there was something he — and virtually all of his peers — were able to do to help.

After 9/11, President Bush exhorted Americans to shop and ""get down to Disney World."" Bush was widely mocked for this — I probably mocked him myself. But he was on to something. The best way for Americans to reduce the fear that terrorists seek to spread — the best way to be useful — was to quickly return to normal life — to shop and go to Disney World.

This is an important lesson to remember as the Reopen debate becomes more heated. I suspect what many people are thinking about when they talk about reopening is not the raging 100-keg party they want to have. They want to find a way to contribute that isn't just huddling at home. Huddling at home feels cowardly, hidden, and impotent.

Humans are allergic to inaction, and long to be useful. That's why so many thousands of people have signed up to be directly infected by the coronavirus as part of a vaccine trial, why so many volunteer opportunities are oversubscribed.

We'd be in better shape as a nation — and the reopen debate would be less poisonous — if our leaders could find more ways to make more of us feel useful, or even be useful. Sitting on the couch doesn't feel like enough. —DP

Two shocking numbers about the restaurant catastrophe

The food-service industry accounted for 60% of March job losses, but according to Insider's Sara Silverstein's interview with chef and food TV host Andrew Zimmern the industry received only 9% of the funds from the Paycheck Protection Program, the small business lending program set up by Congress. — DP

A former prosecutor says he's skeptical about the sexual assault allegation against former Vice President Biden, but his own political preferences are clear

Amid growing calls for Biden himself to address the sexual assault allegation recently made against him — his campaign has said it didn't happen, but he himself hasn't answered in-depth questions — a former federal prosecutor explains in USA Today why he's skeptical about the claim.

The former prosecutor, Michael Stern, says his default view is to believe women who come forward with assault allegations. But he says that very occasionally — twice in a 30-year career — he dismissed cases because he became convinced that the stories he was being told weren't true.

Stern doesn't mention his personal political preferences in the op-ed, but his Twitter bio make them clear: ""#Resisting all things Trump,"" the bio reads. ""#BlueNoMatterWho."" During the sexual-assault hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Stern wrote op-eds that take the other side of at least one of the points he makes while assessing the credibility of Biden's accuser, former staffer Tara Reade.

In his USA Today op-ed, Stern cites 9 reasons for skepticism of Reade, among them her 27-year reporting delay and the lack of a record of a formal complaint that Reade says she filed. On the first point, Stern explained in a column during the Kavanaugh hearings the many reasons why some women do wait years and decades to come forward, or never to speak out at all.

Tara Reade's allegation against Biden is critically important. It could impact the election, and, with it, the future of the world. So as Biden himself has suggested, the facts and interpretations should be scrutinized.

Some readers of Stern's column will note his political preferences and discount everything he says. Others will judge the points he makes independently of his motivations for making them.

No one will ever know for certain what happened in that hallway back in 1993, or even if anything happened at all. Instead, as additional information and interpretations emerge, we will develop our own views of the allegation,the participants, and those who comment on the allegations just as we have with the many sexual assault and harassment allegations made against President Trump. — HB

A new twist in the story about the couple who drank fish-tank cleaner after President Trump touted a similar-sounding coronavirus wonder drug

As you may remember, shortly after the President began extolling the benefits of an old malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, a woman in Arizona reported that her husband had died after she suggested that they take some of a similar-sounding chemical, which was in fact fish-tank cleaner.

The distraught woman, who had also ended up in the hospital, blamed the President and said she didn't know why anyone would ever listen to him.

This story was cited by some as an inevitable consequence of Trump's reckless promotion of unproven quack remedies in press conferences. It was cited by others as evidence of nothing more than human stupidity.

But it turns out the moral of the story may be something else altogether.

The Washington Free Beacon reports that the homicide division of the Mesa City, Arizona police department are now conducting an investigation into the husband's death and requested a recording to the wife's interview with the outlet. Rather than having been nudged into tragedy by the President's ramblings, it seems, there may have been something else going on. — HB

Should cities take advantage of the pandemic to close streets to cars?

Cities have closed or are planning to close more than 1,000 miles of streets to cars because of COVID-19.

1,000 miles!

The street closures, which include everything from hundreds of miles of pop-up bike lanes in Paris to 11 miles of car-free parkways in Louisville, certainly make sense as a temporary measure. The pandemic has slashed urban commuting, and social distancing means all of us need more space when we go outside.

This is policy by tragedy, so bike and pedestrian activists are careful not to be gleeful, but they're also using the #Covid19streets hashtag to make the case for making changes permanent. Obviously some roads must reopen when commuters and shoppers return. But it's also likely that cities may rebound faster with better infrastructure for walkers and cyclists.

As anyone who's lived through a neighborhood bike lane debate knows, city dwellers grumble before streets go car free or parking spaces disappear, but they almost always end up cherishing the space to bike and walk. — DP

And now... your thoughts!

On ""Why didn't Pence wear a mask?""

First, the results of our poll! About a third of you think the reason Pence didn't wear a mask at the Mayo Clinic is that ""he wants Trump to keep him on the ticket."" Another third of you believe he had multiple reasons for doing so:



And now, some of your letters:

Pence didn't wear a mask because he's brave, and bravery is inspiring

As a registered independent voting older American I'd like to present you with a different angle, one that many more centrist older Americans may find more acceptable. Pence didn't wear a mask to show that we can't live in fear forever and that wearing a mask for the rest of our lives is not a cure-all either.

You're too young to remember the Communist witch hunt and how that snowballed into a serious issue in the US and the subsequent hiding in bunkers and under our school desks because you never knew when a nuclear bomb was coming. But somebody at some point finally said enough is enough and figured out that yes, there is a threat but no, we can not allow this to all consume our lives.

Bravo to Pence for showing courage as is his right to do. It's not a law to wear a mask (not yet, anyway), and somebody has to step up and show that you can resume your life without fear. Lastly, if Pence is the only person in the room not wearing the protective security of a face mask wouldn't he be less likely to contract the virus or give it to someone else? — from reader B.C.

Pence is Trump's lapdog

Pence is Trump's lapdog, reading from a script whenever he's on TV, kowtowing to his boss.

He and Trump are an embarrassment to our country. Pence's stunt at the Mayo clinic is reprehensible, at best.

The Mayo Clinic should have refused to let him in the hospital. While the Mayo Clinic is renowned worldwide as a leader in the medical field, Pence is a politician. Pence would have looked like an idiot, and the Mayo Clinic would have further enhanced it's reputation as a top-notch quality medical institution that stands by its principles. — from reader G.C.

On ""Blaming the victims of COVID-19"":

The point is that people are dying because they're listening to Trump

I have not read the New York Times article you refer to, but I have read the Washington Post article. Although you state that the Post paints a subtle, sympathetic portrait…,"" you go on to say that ""I don't get the point of these stories, which reduce rich, complicated lives to an ironic punchline.""

I think that is an unfair characterization of the Post article. The article did not mock his beliefs, but I think pointed out how people like him have been and may continue to be harmed by their faith in a president who spews out medical nonsense and is failing to lead. Trump's failure of leadership is harming all Americans, both in terms of medical advice and economically, especially those who support him. Just look at the jump in poison control calls following the president's bleach comment. That is what comes through to me from the Post article, not a punchline. — from reader B.M.

The company, best known for its vacuum cleaners, said last month it had an order from the UK government for 10,000 of the breathing machines and developed one it called the CoVent.

Dyson was awaiting regulatory approval for the design of the CoVent, reportedly built in 10 days using the company’s existing motor technology. The bed-mounted, portable ventilator is able to run on battery power if necessary.

Ventilators are needed to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, many of whom suffer from severe respiratory symptoms. Other companies— including GM, Ford, and Tesla—shifted to developing ventilators over the past several weeks as demand for the devices increased.

James Dyson, the company founder, said he did not regret the time and resources put into the ventilator effort. “Mercifully they are not required,” he said in a statement adding, “I have some hope that our ventilator may yet help the response in other countries, but that requires further time and investigation.”",real

USA TODAY NETWORK

In hundreds of cities across the USA, scientists hope monitoring systems will provide an early warning if coronavirus infections reemerge as communities in some states cautiously reopen.

These monitors don't rely on testing patients or tracing contacts.

All that's required? Human waste.

Over the past few months, private companies and university researchers have partnered with communities to collect sewage at treatment plants and test it for the presence of the novel coronavirus. The results are reported to municipal governments and state health officials to help them monitor the situation.

Testing wastewater can reveal evidence of the coronavirus and show whether it’s increasing or decreasing in a community, said Ian Pepper, a professor and co-director of the University of Arizona’s Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, one of the groups tracking the virus through different municipal sewage systems.

Although they cannot determine the exact number of COVID-19 cases from the wastewater, researchers said they can estimate the potential case count based on the amount of genetic material detected, the number of customers per system and the volume of wastewater generated. They continue to improve upon those estimates, trying to achieve greater accuracy.

They need a better understanding of “how much virus is shed in the stool” when someone is infected, said Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot Analytics, a startup company formed by a group of researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is heavily involved in the emerging science.

“As our understanding of this evolves, and as Biobot collects more and more data,” Ghaeli said, “our case estimates will be refined.”

When the coronavirus attacks a person’s body, it leaves a trail of castoff genetic evidence that winds up in wastewater flushed from toilets across a community.

Scientists watched this spring as that evidence emerged at sewage treatment facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Paris, Australia and the Netherlands. By sampling the wastewater, researchers detected COVID-19 hot spots days, and sometimes weeks, before those cases appeared in hospital admissions data and clinical testing.

Such early detection – the virus marks the body before or even without the development of physical symptoms such as a fever or cough – is aimed at helping communities better respond to the pandemic. Officials can issue stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread. Hospitals can stock and staff ahead of a wave of patients.

The information can help local governments, many of which are reporting declining COVID-19 cases, spot the first signs of an anticipated autumn resurgence. And it can help them measure the effectiveness of their actions. In Paris, the utility provider reported finding coronavirus particles in wastewater before cases began to grow exponentially, then it observed the quantities decrease as a result of a lockdown.

Hundreds of communities

Promising results from initial studies have spawned widespread interest, and the science is expanding to hundreds of public utilities across the USA through a collection of initiatives.

Most prolific is Biobot Analytics, which worked with local governments to track the prevalence of opioid use through wastewater testing before shifting focus to COVID-19 this year. It monitors wastewater data from 400 communities across 42 states.

Using $6.7 million in seed money and collaborating with researchers at MIT, Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Biobot provides the testing for free.

The company concluded that wastewater sampling in Massachusetts and Delaware indicated a bigger coronavirus outbreak than reported through hospital admissions and clinical testing. In New Castle County, Delaware, the estimates were 15 times the laboratory-confirmed cases.

“This is a high-level way of getting a quick snapshot of the scope of a virus in a community,” Ghaeli said. “We’re hopeful this data becomes very useful in the long run, when we have opened up again, in determining the reemergence of the virus.”

Your guide to COVID-19:What you need to know about the coronavirus

The sewage surveillance, in concert with clinical testing and reported cases, can give officials a broad look at COVID-19 in their community, Ghaeli said. Biobot provides the numbers to participating utilities, which in turn provide the data to officials and health departments, she said.

In early April, the utility in Albany, Oregon, started sharing with Biobot weekly samples of pre-treated sewage from the Albany-Millersburg Water Reclamation Facility.

The weekly sampling occurs alongside routine water testing, meaning little additional work for the staff, said David Gilbey, the city’s environmental services manager. It costs about $120 a week for sample bottles and shipping, according to the city’s website. Results usually come within a week, Gilbey said, and are shared with the county health department.

The research holds “much promise,” Gilbey said. The community has seen declining coronavirus cases and things are starting to reopen, he said. If the wastewater numbers increase, that information would help the utility and local governments “get ready” by adding social distance measures or stockpiling more resources.

“It kind of gives us an idea of what we may be in for over the next couple of months,” he said.

At the University of Arizona, Pepper chairs one of the many committees looking at how to handle the possible return of students to campus this fall. He said the university will sample the campus wastewater for at least a year to monitor coronavirus levels.

In Detroit, officials announced Monday they are refocusing a 2-year-old study with Michigan State University to try to detect COVID-19 in the wastewater. The study was originally designed to determine whether they could track disease-causing viruses in the city's sewer system.

City health officials said the Detroit study found viruses in the sewer collection system about one to two weeks before those same viruses showed up in health department data.

From November 2017 to February 2018, then from October 2018 to March 2019, samples were collected weekly before treatment at Detroit's Water Resource Recovery Facility.

Looking for disease

Scientists hope to promote development of a national wastewater surveillance network to monitor and respond to not just the coronavirus but all kinds of infectious diseases, Ghaeli said.

In Israel, a wastewater-based monitoring system for polio started in 1989. In 2013, when the surveillance indicated a polio outbreak was occurring, government officials swept in with polio vaccines and prevented any cases of paralysis.

Routine sampling for emerging viral diseases isn’t standard practice at most wastewater treatment facilities. Ghaeli hopes it will become permanent and so prevalent that the information is integrated into public health decision-making.

Monitoring wastewater could be especially beneficial as an early warning in a “micro context,” for example at nursing homes or care facilities, where the rapidly spreading coronavirus has been responsible for many deaths, concluded a group of researchers led by Gorka Orive, a biomedical researcher at the University of the Basque Country in Spain.

Even in a larger context, such as a neighborhood or city, the information could help officials adopt more focused and balanced measures, including restricting movement, the researchers wrote in an article to be published in the Elsevier journal Science of the Total Environment. Early warnings, the group wrote, could save lives.

Scientists have studied disease in sewage for years, said Kyle Bibby, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Notre Dame. Researchers in Sweden showed two decades ago that a single infection in one person could be detected in the wastewater from 10,000 people.

As genetic research advances and many groups monitor wastewater for the coronavirus, the science is moving very fast.

“Everyone is sort of learning as they go,” Bibby said.

Bibby’s team works with dozens of utilities, and the research groups collaborate and share what they learn, he said.

More than a dozen research papers have been published, some in pre-print without full peer review, since the beginning of the year.

Additional research is planned.

“This is definitely a community effort,” Bibby said, “through a broad, scientific community.”

1474,1677,https://www.politico.eu/article/british-council-faces-financial-ruin-due-to-coronavirus-covid19/,2020-05-21,British Council faces financial ruin due to coronavirus,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Ferguson led the Imperial College team that designed the computer model that, among others, had been used to justify the recent stay-at-home orders in England as well as in the United States. We now know the model was so highly flawed it never should have been relied upon for policy decisions to begin with.

Epidemiology—the study of the incidence, prevalence, and impact of disease—frequently calls upon models to forecast potential outcomes of diseases. Not surprisingly, once COVID-19 became a pandemic, policy experts from all across the world began relying on such models.

LISTEN TO DR. DAYARATNA SPEAK ABOUT THIS ON HEARTLAND’S PODCAST

﻿

The Imperial College researchers ran one such model they had used in prior research and forecast a number of potential outcomes, including that, by October, more than 500,000 people in Great Britain and 2 million people in the U.S. would die as a result of COVID-19.

The model also predicted the United States could incur up to 1 million deaths even with “enhanced social distancing” guidelines, including “shielding the elderly.” Imperial’s modeling results influenced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to impose a nationwide lockdown and influenced the White House as well.

I asked Ferguson and his colleagues for their model on multiple occasions to see how they got their numbers, but they never replied to my emails.

According to Nature, they had been “working with Microsoft to tidy up the code and make it available.” I also asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the codes it used to develop its COVID-19 forecasts, but got no response.

So, my colleague Norbert Michel and I decided to take a publicly available COVID-19 epidemiological model and forecast the prevalence and mortality of the disease under a variety of plausible scenarios.

The results varied, depending on the assumptions we made about mortality rates within hospital intensive care units, asymptomatic rates, and the specification of the R0 (pronounced R-naught) value, which measures how easily the virus spreads.

We found mortality rate predictions can be quite variable depending on the age and comorbidities of those contracting the virus.

Under varying assumptions regarding a mortality rate in intensive care units between 5% and 30%, we found that predicted mortality because of the disease could range from near 78,000 deaths to as many as 810,000 deaths in the U.S. by Aug. 1.

Recent testing data indicates that the asymptomatic rate for COVID-19 is likely not trivial, and data from Iceland indicates this rate can be as high as 50%. Assuming an asymptomatic rate ranging from 15% to 55%, one can project deaths in the U.S. of between 118,000 and 394,000 by Aug. 1.

Lastly, we looked at the model’s assumption about the virus’ basic reproductive number, the aforementioned R0 value. Popularized in the 2011 movie “Contagion,” the R0 value quantifies the average number of people who will get the virus from someone who is an infected.

Under assumptions of the R0 value ranging from 1.5 to 3.5—plausible estimates based on medical research as discussed in our paper—the model predicted from 44,000 dead to 1.1 million dead by Aug. 1 in the U.S.

According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, we are currently over 83,000 deaths, which exceeds our lower-end estimates. But the point our research made is that these types of models produce many plausible scenarios, depending on reasonable assumptions.

As we learn more about the new coronavirus, it is imperative to continue to update the assumptions used in these models.

After we had published our work, news surfaced that Microsoft had actually made some headway in making the Imperial College team’s model available. But the codes it released are a highly modified version of what the Imperial team actually used.

And, it turns out, the model has serious flaws, which a former software engineer from Google discusses at length in his blog.

The Imperial College code provides different answers using the same inputs. In particular, the same assumptions can provide results that differ by 80,000 deaths over a span of 80 days. The software engineer has noted there are apparently myriad other problems as well—including undocumented codes and numerous bugs.

This isn’t the first time bad models have made their way into policy. As we discussed in our work, statistical models can be useful tools for guiding policy, but they are only as credible as the assumptions on which they are based.

It is fundamentally important for models used in policy to be made publicly available, have assumptions clearly stated, and have their robustness to changes to these assumptions tested. Models also need to be updated as time goes on in line with the best available evidence.

Bottom line: The Imperial College model didn’t meet any of these criteria. And sadly, its model was one of the inputs relied on as the basis for locking down two countries.

The codes we used at The Heritage Foundation are available here. Our assumptions are clearly stated in our paper here.",fake

Tenants of a dormitory on 11 Cheredovaya Street in the city of Omsk were locked in the building. All the tenants of the building are not allowed to go outside. Earlier, several cases of the coronavirus infection were registered among those living in the dormitory, and all 500 tenants found themselves under the conditions of strict quarantine.

Police officers were put on guard at the entrances – the citizens supposedly do not follow the rules of the self-isolation mode. However, the officers have not been able to show the decree on quarantine restrictions to the tenants because they do not have the document themselves.

All the tenants of the dormitory are thus prohibited from going outside: the people are not allowed to go out to buy groceries, medications or other essential drugs. Most of them survive with the help of their relatives and friends, who bring them food.

Those who do not have anyone to help them, were forced to go from door to door asking for bread.

Someone reportedly tried to go out to buy groceries through the back door, but the door was soon blocked. Someone else, as it was reported, jumped out of the window on the second storey to be able to go to buy groceries.

The White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which is co-chaired by White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and includes Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson and IBM (IBM.N) Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty, plans to call for “an unprecedented investment in digital infrastructure.”

The board’s efforts are aimed at helping connect displaced workers with pathways to upgrade their skills and learn new skills so they can move into “good jobs in rebounding fields as the health crisis abates and the economy begins to recover,” according to a White House official briefed on the plan.

“Our nation cannot achieve a satisfactory post-pandemic recovery unless the technological infrastructure is in place to connect and empower all Americans to participate in the workforce,” the official said in recapping the board’s message.

The board wants governments “to streamline occupational licensing, education requirements, reduce the cost of licensing, and increase reciprocity” and urges the federal government to “allow student financial aid for high-quality, short-term, market-aligned credential programs.”

Workforce issues have taken on new importance as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the economy.

The United States lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.

In a statement, Ross said the advisory board’s meeting comes at a “challenging” time, but expressed confidence the president’s policies will lead to a rapid rebound.

Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find “solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.”

“By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,” IBM’s Rometty said in a statement.

Share All sharing options for: ‘Our worst day’: The fight to treat patients and keep a hospital staffed on the Far South Side

Capri Reese can’t go home. Not unless she finds someone to step into her shoes.

“All of a sudden we’re down five staff in one day,” said the 12-year veteran nurse at Roseland Community Hospital, who Tuesday had to track down coworkers on their day off and get them to the hospital, in addition to all her usual duties.

“I see patients, treat patients, respond to codes, rapid response, intubate, order tests, write prescriptions,” Reese said. “All of those things, and I’m also covering for the CNO — the chief nursing officer.”

Five holes in a 14-person staff, including someone to do her job after her 12-hour shift. Those are very big charm-studded Crocs to fill.

“It’s a juggling thing, like a rolling puzzle, every day,” she said. “People who don’t usually call off are calling off.”

Why? Exhaustion, stress, ailments like the ordinary flu, plus absences related to COVID-19 — battling it themselves, caring for a relation who is, or watching their children because daycare centers are closed.

Against those obstacles, Reese has only her considerable charm.

“Strap that S on your chest and come in,” Reese said over the phone to a triage tech.

He agreed.

“I won the lottery!” exuded Reese. ”He’s totally coming in on his day off. Everybody is really stepping up.”

She worked the schedule in Roseland’s “brain box,” the cluttered office where staffing is managed. But a code blue alarm — there will be five during her shift — had her jumping to her feet. She ran — not walked fast, not trotted, but full-out sprinted — down the hall, phone still pressed to her ear, talking to one of the staffing agencies the hospital has turned to, trying to keep warm bodies in scrubs to treat the bodies in beds.

The problem with staffing agencies, she said, is that other war zones, like New York, are paying top dollar, and her nurses are taking it.

“Their husband may be out of work, and they tell me, ‘It’s not so much I don’t love Roseland, but they’re offering me more money and we’re down an income,’” Reese said.

‘Like playing dodgeball’

Once in the emergency department, she jams the phone in a pocket; staffing concerns are forgotten in the rainstorm of immediate problems, big and small.

A patient has wandered away from his room and doesn’t know where he belongs.

“Capri, handle this,” said a doctor, shrugging away the situation.

The ER is low on protective gowns; Reese rushes to the stock room.

“It’s like playing dodgeball,” she said. Like dodgeball, there is much starting and stopping. It seems she will greet everyone in her line of sight by name and can’t take five steps without someone asking her something.

“People are comfortable asking me,” said Reese, who keeps asking passersby, “Can you work until 11? Can you work until 11?”

“I need you,” she said, again and again. “I need you.”

Others, she’ll merely buck up, asking how they are. Not wanting to hug — a more important part of hospital work than outsiders might realize — they’ve developed an elaborate code of bows, foot taps, even the occasional curtsy.

“The nursing staff is under enormous stress,” Reese said.

‘It’s hitting home’

This all happened so fast. Six weeks. The first person with COVID-19 came into Roseland, on West 111th Street on the Far South Side, on March 15.

“Every day since then,” Reese said. “It isn’t some virus overseas. It’s home; it’s hitting home. It became so real. Pandemonium. People coming in, while information and standards change day to day. While we’re trying to get creative, expand to deal with the volume of patients. It’s overwhelming.”

Unless it’s not. The COVID unit can be silent. Scary quiet. Reese misses the presence of visitors, banished because of the fear of infection. Visitors are a vital line of defense in the health care chain.

“Normally patients have a visitor, sitting with their mom, letting you know their needs. Those are the assessments we are really missing out on. All the history, what’s going on with their mother, their father. Real time information. Everybody being isolated, it’s really hard to manage all of it, being one nurse.”

The deathly silence in the COVID-19 ward is broken by alarms, screams, cries for help. Reese joined knots of staffers, crammed into Roseland’s tiny rooms, responding to five code blues — hospital jargon for when a patient’s heart stops beating — and two rapid responses. Three patients died during her Tuesday shift, all of COVID-19.

“It was our worst day,” said Reese.

The stress of losing patients, of keeping gravely ill patients alive, of being family to the dying, bursts out sometimes. A patient gasped for air, but kept tearing off her BiPAP mask.

“Help me! Help me!” she cried.

“Patients have so much anxiety, even a little shortness of breath causes them to go into a panic,” said Reese.

One nurse wanted to restrain the struggling patient so she’d keep wearing the BiPAP, a pressurized breathing device. Another nurse argued that restraining the patient is wrong.

“No, we’re not doing that!” she said, adding that the patient was not a criminal.

The argument quickly grew heated, with swearing and shouting.

“Talk to me when you go to college for another four years!” snapped the senior nurse. “Until then, you don’t tell me what to do!”

One nurse stormed out and took a walk to calm down. The senior nurse stayed; the patient eventually was coaxed back into the mask.

Reese herself is not immune to the pressure. Last week, with no visitors allowed, a nurse held a cell phone so a dying woman’s daughter could say goodbye to her mother, apologizing for not being the child she should have been. Then the nurse handed the phone to Reese, to flee the room, weeping. When she returned, Reese handed the phone back to her and left the room; she had to cry, too.

“We never had the chance to talk about it,” said Reese, of the second nurse. “We had another rapid response.”

At home, a game face

Reese, who grew up in the Roseland community, misses having a life outside the hospital. Her family certainly misses her.

“It’s been a while, because of the coronavirus,” said her mother, Chrystle Lee, a breast cancer survivor. “I’m like, ‘Oh, come on over. You’ve got the mask on.’ And she says, ‘You don’t understand, you’re high risk. Your immune system is down. I can’t come over there.’”

There was a trace of criticism as she imitated her daughter’s refusal. Then Lee softens.

“She’ll order me food, from Uber Eats. I don’t even have to ask. It’s just there. We have a good family.”

The difficulties of getting the message to her mother is something Capri Reese sees throughout the community.

“When this disease first broke out, everybody thought that for some reason that this was not a disease for African Americans,” she said. “That it didn’t affect us. It’s actually the opposite. We’re getting that message out there, where my family lives. If people are infected and are shopping, we’re all exposed.”

At 7 p.m. Reese indeed was able to go home after 12 hours on duty. “I got two people to come in, three to stay later,” she said. “I’m still short.”

Her own family — a 15-year-old daughter, unhappy about not going to school, and Reese’s 18-year-old younger brother — live in a South Loop apartment.

At home, Reese immediately stripped off her lab coat and cleaned her shoes with antibacterial spray. Still wearing a mask, she took off her aqua scrubs and put them directly into the washing machine; the machine, and a shower, are conveniently near the door.

She stepped into the shower — some alone time, to assemble her game face.

“It’s scary,” she said. “I am, to be honest, scared. I have broken down, several times. But if you know me, I’m a ‘There’s-no-crying-in-baseball’ kind of person. I have to keep a strong face in front of my family.”",real

Watch the latest episode, ""Coronavirus in Navajo Nation,"" in the video player above.

Navajo Nation is one of the hardest-hit regions per capita for coronavirus in the U.S. Despite its relatively low population density, this area has a higher coronavirus death rate than that of 46 states. CBS News spoke with Navajo Nation health care workers on the front lines. Here are three of their stories, in their own words.

Dr. Sophina Calderon

Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation, Tuba City

Dr. Sophina Calderon grew up in Navajo Nation and practices family medicine at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation. CBS News

Dr. Calderon grew up outside of Tuba City in the Navajo Nation. She is a family medicine practitioner and the deputy chief of staff at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation. She is currently seeing patients in the emergency department after the surge in COVID-19 cases in Navajo Nation.



COVID-19 actually appeared at the beginning of March after a super-spreader event suspected of being a church rally that happened here in the Navajo Nation. People from all over actually went and attended this rally. Shortly after, we had our first suspected case here in Tuba City in mid-March. Since then, we've had a lot of those people fall ill and show up here at our facility.



That's when things changed significantly. Many of our regular [medical] services stopped to a halt, and we repurposed staff to set up an outdoor screening area. We repurposed our pediatric care unit to become our respiratory care unit. We have 24 beds in that unit, but our staff and nursing shortage significantly impacts how many we can actually admit and keep here. We can only fill about 15 beds.



Pre-COVID, a lot of the Indian Health Service Hospitals across the country have high [medical staff] vacancy rates already at baseline. And we've always been able to make do with that here, but once COVID hit, that deficiency just really became much more apparent.



Our most critical patients, the ones that are severely ill and need to be intubated, are transferred to Flagstaff and to Phoenix — areas far off the reservation. Every day we're intubating and sending out at least two to four patients a day. Our worst day that I can remember, we intubated and sent out about nine people, and that's all by chopper.

We could keep more critical patients here if we could increase our ICU nursing staff, critical care nursing staff, and if we could get an intensive care doctor. We have ventilators. We have space. We just don't have the staff to do it.



One of the things that break my heart is the number of people we need to transfer out every day. Families are left stranded from each other.



A lot of Navajo households are actually multigenerational. We deeply treasure families — large families. We live in the belief of a matrilineal clanship system, so who we consider family is far-reaching and extensive. But if someone falls ill, the rest of the household will get sick as well.



Families are hesitant to break themselves apart, send their grandparents elsewhere where it would be safer. They would much rather stay together, and to them, that's much more meaningful in this whole fight for survival here — to keep their families together.



I grew up without running water or electricity in a small area just right outside of town. My parents still live in that home. The pediatricians who took care of me while I was growing up are my colleagues now. The doctors who took care of my grandparents when diagnosed with cancer, those are my colleagues now too.



We have a vast number of very committed people making sure this hospital runs well. A lot of these doctors raised their own families here as well. Many of the people who work here are from this community. Our patients are our relatives.



When I help the epidemiology team sort through data, I look at these lists, and I recognize a lot of the names of patients. Some of them might be my primary care patients. Every once in a while I see my own relatives listed. That's really hard.



Many families are already greatly affected. A lot of the illness has actually clustered in some families. A parent, two children, and a brother — all in one family have died. It's something that really affects me significantly because I live here. My whole family is here.



We see New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana getting significant help from the government, whether it's PPE or staffing. I feel like we are this hidden hotspot pocket. We haven't seen nearly as much help as you see in these other places.



There is a huge feeling of isolation. Many families have voiced this feeling the government isn't aware of what's going on here? Doesn't anyone else see what's going on here?

Dr. Aaron Price

Tsehootsooi Medical Center, Fort Defiance

Dr. Aaron Price grew up in Navajo Nation. He is the chief of internal medicine at Tsehootsooi Medical Center in Fort Defiance, Arizona. CBS News

Dr. Aaron Price grew up in Fort Defiance in the Navajo Nation. He is the chief of internal medicine at Tsehootsooi Medical Center.



I remember when I was a little kid, if you were being bad, they would always threaten to take you to the hospital. They would say, ""Oh, if you're a bad kid, I'm going to take you to the hospitals, and they can give you a shot,"" almost like a form of punishment.



There is a stigma about patients going to the hospital and dying. You have to go back to the historical trauma that the Navajo people had to endure in years past. Once upon a time, hospitals were not really sanctuaries or a place you went for help, but rather someplace you went to die. Hospitals were sanitariums, and that lingers on in our elders, and it's passed on.



Unfortunately, in this pandemic, there's a good chance that you could get sick enough and end up in the hospital. Worst-case scenario, they get a breathing tube put down their throat. In most cases, once that happens, they're basically alone and it's a good chance they're also going to die alone as well. That's the fact of this condition. It's very unfortunate, but that's what we're seeing right now.



This really hits home to the model that was preached initially from day one — our drive is to flatten the curve. We [at Fort Defiance] have been at the tail end of the pandemic more than in the eye of the hurricane.



Circumstances here as a whole are looking pretty good, and we want to stay optimistic. There's not a lot of optimism happening right now. We won't know until it arrives, but right now, I feel like we have the capacity, the bandwidth, and the manpower to deal with that at this time.



For many years we've had very, very limited resources. For many years the pattern has been to send grandma off to the big city – to Phoenix, Albuquerque or Flagstaff — because they had the technology. They had the specialists to provide definitive care. I mean, imagine if you were sent somewhere where you had no inclination for the language, the customs, the norms and the expectations.



What's really compelling for me is, for the first time in a long time, reservation hospitals are rising to that occasion. [Tsehootsooi Medical Center] actually has the people with the training, and Navajo physicians at that.



I think the fact that you actually have someone who looks, talks and walks like you offers so much reassurance. That's a testament to how far we've come and the direction we're going. We're moving up.



Dr. Michelle Tom

Winslow Indian Health Care Center and Little Colorado Medical Clinic, Winslow

Dr. Michelle Tom grew up in Navajo Nation and now practices family medicine. CBS News

Dr. Michelle Tom grew up in the southern region of the Navajo Nation. After her medical training, she returned home to practice family medicine. She transitioned to treating patients in Winslow Indian Health Care Center's urgent care and Little Colorado Medical Clinic's emergency room after COVID-19 patients began arriving at both facilities.



As a family medical doctor, you treat everyone from infants to the elders. It's such an amazing atmosphere. You get to know entire families. It's always great when I have a grandmother call me her daughter or her child and thank me for doing what I do because they've never met a Navajo doctor before. It's a dream come true for me.



And you got to see them, their faces, and they got to see mine. We gave handshakes and hugs. All my elders gave me hugs before they left. The medicine I love, and that of my own experiences growing up with Native American healers, was about connection, about touch, sharing a close space and helping to heal. We don't have that anymore. It's off the telephone, it's between me and PPE, or a door.



Now when I'm in the hospital, urgent care, emergency room, I'm wondering if a COVID patient is going to come in. How am I going to prevent them from getting worse? Or am I going to lose this person now? Is it this time that I'm going to contract it? Physicians and nurses, we're struggling.



We don't have an ICU per se in our facility, so we have to transport critical patients.

Dr. Michelle Tom shows CBSN Originals' Adam Yamaguchi the urgent care facility where she works. CBS News

When a young person who was vibrant the week before comes in and we have to tell him if he goes on another liter of oxygen we're going to have to intubate and send him out to another facility — how do you tell him that? And then he asks, ""When will they take it out?"" And you have to be honest, and say you don't know. I don't know how to put that feeling into words. He's someone's son, someone's brother.

People in the U.S. want to reopen the country. I believe in a public health standard, and as a physician, I think it's too early. The cases are steadily still climbing in Navajo Nation.

We are a strong people. I think that's what I'm most proud of. But when you see a brother or sister, kinship, and they're asking for help and there's not much more you can do for them, it's something you're really never fully trained for.

I think it humbles me to know that I can do only so much, but I will do what I can while I'm here. I ask for guidance from my ancestors and my healers in the past who have passed onto the next life. Remembering them, honoring them when I pray.

All I know is what we have today — a hope that the attention will move Congress and our administration. We need more access to health care and infrastructure, water, plumbing, electricity, education, and jobs that will help feed families. These are huge issues that have been going on for so long. It's not going to happen overnight, but I am hopeful. We're getting there, slowly but surely. Hopefully, in my lifetime, it will change.

CO2 reached an all-time daily high on May 3rd, hitting levels that haven’t been seen in the more than 60 years since records began.

The annual average is also expected to rise, according to an analysis published today by scientists at the national meteorological service for the UK and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They found that the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is still climbing steadily, and that the dramatic changes from the pandemic barely slowed it down.

Yesterday, the highest ever greenhouse gas concentration in history was observed at Mauna Loa Observatory: 418.12 parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere.



Improved national climate action plans are crucial to reverse the trend > https://t.co/QJrTeFrPw6 #NDCs pic.twitter.com/B5Ggnfr24p — UN Climate Change (@UNFCCC) May 4, 2020

The data shows how much more ambitious efforts need to be in order to stop heating up our planet. The temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions as people stay in during the pandemic just isn’t enough to undo the decades of damage humans have inflicted by burning fossil fuels.

“Humanity’s waste pile is in the atmosphere and that doesn’t go away,” says Scripps Oceanography geochemist Ralph Keeling. “The CO2 is building up in response to not just what we’re emitting right now but what we have emitted over the past century.”

It may feel like the world has come to a virtual stop amid orders to shut down businesses and shelter in place during the pandemic. The effect that’s had on how much planet-heating pollution people pump out is already about six times greater than the 2008 Great Recession had on carbon emissions. But the total drop in global greenhouse gas emissions this year as a result of the COVID-19 crisis is projected to be just about 8 percent, according to the International Energy Agency.

“Humanity’s waste pile is in the atmosphere”

“Eight percent is not an awful lot in the grand scheme of things,” says Sean Sublette, a meteorologist at the nonprofit Climate Central. The difference it will make in slowing down climate change is marginal.

An important thing to keep in mind is that carbon dioxide can persist in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years after it escapes our factories and tailpipes. “It’s like a bathtub and you’ve had the spigot on full blast for a while, and you turn it back 10%, but you’re still filling the bathtub,” says Sublette. “You haven’t really stopped filling the bathtub, you’ve just slowed it a tiny bit.”

May is a key time to pay attention to carbon dioxide levels because it’s when concentrations in the atmosphere typically peak. Levels fluctuate slightly throughout the year based on the seasons. In the summer, plants in the Northern Hemisphere — where there’s more land mass — are in full gear drawing down carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. They’re less active in the fall and winter, and when their leaves drop and decompose, they release carbon dioxide. The cycle ultimately leads to a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide in May, as spring transforms plants from leafless to bushy again, followed by a drop as summer approaches.

Carbon dioxide concentrations have peaked each year

Carbon dioxide concentrations have peaked each year since record-keeping began at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in 1958. From a starting point of 318 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in May 1958, the all-time high recorded this month reached 418.12 parts per million. The upward trend is called the Keeling Curve, after the scientist Charles David Keeling who began making the measurements.

To flatten that curve, emissions need to permanently drop by at least 50 percent, according to Ralph Keeling, who continues the research his father started. That will likely require a combination of behavior change — like we’re seeing now — and sweeping structural changes. “The changes are too big to expect it to happen just because of individual choices,” he says.

Ultimately, greenhouse gas emissions need to reach virtually zero by 2050 to avoid worst-case scenarios with climate change, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",real

Trump's demands, made in a letter Tuesday to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, are an escalation of his attacks on the organization. He accused the WHO of ""repeated missteps"" during the coronavirus pandemic and demanded it ""demonstrate independence"" from China.

'This will kill you':People warn others after Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

""My administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste,"" Trump wrote in his ultimatum, which comes about a month after he froze WHO funding, pending a formal investigation into the international health body and its coronavirus response.

The letter lists Trump's allegations that the United Nations agency missed warning signs of the virus's spread, then blithely accepted China's lack of transparency over the outbreak. The WHO initially circulated preliminary Chinese claims that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus.

COVID-19:Health Secretary Alex Azar slams WHO as China backs coronavirus investigation

In his letter, Trump did not outline specific actions the WHO needs to take to satisfy his demands. Monday, Trump called the U.N. health body a ""puppet of China.""

Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said Trump's letter was ""smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention."" He called it a Trump administration attempt ""to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic.""

The WHO said in a statement it was ""considering the contents"" of Trump's letter, but otherwise, it had no comment.

The organization has disputed claims from the Trump administration that it acted too slowly in sounding the alarm over coronavirus. Public health experts have long warned the agency is overly bureaucratic and in need of reform. Little evidence has emerged to substantiate accusations from Trump administration officials that the WHO deliberately acted in concert with China to obfuscate what it knew about the outbreak.

Monday, Ghebreyesus said he would launch an independent evaluation of the WHO’s coronavirus response ""at the earliest appropriate moment."" Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he would support an independent investigation into the pandemic, though it remains unclear whether any such review would probe the origins of the virus. Trump has speculated, without giving evidence, that the coronavirus escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged late last year.

The United States is the WHO's biggest donor. It paid $400 million to the WHO for 2018-2019, according to the organization's website. That money represents about 15% of the WHO's budget. When Trump said last month that he would temporarily freeze WHO spending, he said he would ""channel"" the money into other areas to combat the coronavirus outbreak. He has not provided specifics on that pledge.

Among the other accusations made in Trump's letter:

He suggested that the WHO, bowing to pressure from China, delayed an emergency declaration connected to the outbreak. (There is no known evidence for this claim.)

He highlighted the global health body's praise of China's government for its ""transparency"" with respect to the coronavirus, setting a ""new standard for outbreak control."" (True. The WHO has gone on record that it believes China has done a good job fighting the coronavirus.)

Trump accused the WHO of ""inexplicably"" opposing his closure of the U.S. border and travel ban from China. (The WHO has consistently argued for years against closing borders and travel bans during pandemics, saying such actions can exacerbate the spread of infectious disease. But it has not publicly questioned Trump's decision.)

He said the agency failed to publicly address accusations of ""China's racially discriminatory actions"" in China against African nationals. (True.)

Trump suggested The Lancet, a British medical journal, published a report in early December about a virus spreading in Wuhan. (False, according to The Lancet. Its editor said the first reports it published were from Chinese scientists Jan 24.)

Analysis: Trump halts funding to WHO. Experts say we need it now more than ever

The WHO held its annual general assembly online, which ends Tuesday. The forum was dominated by many of its 194 members pushing for a review of how the organization responded to the outbreak.

In an interview with the BBC, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it would be ""grossly irresponsible in international humanitarian terms"" for the United States to permanently withdraw its funding for the WHO because of its potential impact on poor countries around the world where the virus has yet to have its full impact.

""The WHO goes in and advises and/or provides direct material help with the setting up of health systems to deal with the crisis on the ground,"" he said.",real

""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do we're going to really be a big step ahead,"" Trump told a reporter Friday at a White House event detailing U.S. efforts to develop a vaccine. ""And if we don't, we're going to be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point, it'll go away,"" Trump said. ""It may flare up and it may not flare up, we'll have to see what happens, but if it does flare up we're going to put out the fire and we'll put it out quickly and efficiently. We've learned a lot."" The president had been asked about his comments earlier in the event, when he said, ""Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back. And we're starting the process. In many cases, they don't have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it."" Trump's remarks downplaying the need for a vaccine came during a Rose Garden announcement unveiling his administration's beefed-up efforts to fast-track the development and distribution of a vaccine for Covid-19. The new project, dubbed ""Operation Warp Speed,"" aims to have hundreds of millions of doses of an effective vaccine available by the end of the year.

Trump formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui and four-star Army Gen. Gustave Perna will help lead the Warp Speed project. Slaoui and Perna both said at the event that they are ""confident"" the operation will be able to achieve its ambitious goals. But Perna acknowledged that it will be a ""Herculean task"" to develop and distribute a vaccine in such a short time frame. It's unclear whether the virus will disappear on its own. Global and U.S. health officials have suggested the virus may be seasonal and relent in the summer before emerging again in the colder seasons. SARS, which emerged in China in 2002 and killed nearly 800 people worldwide, was able to be contained without a vaccine. Health experts, including Trump administration officials, have warned that the virus would likely persist through the fall and could become even more difficult to combat in the winter when flu season picks up. Experts and political leaders alike say that the U.S. won't be able to recover from the pandemic until a vaccine is widely available. Some doubt a vaccine will be ready even within 18 months. Rick Bright, a federal vaccine expert who blew the whistle on the Trump administration after he was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said everything would have to go ""perfectly"" to achieve results in that time. ""We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday in testimony before members of a House health subcommittee.

But the challenges of this spring pale in comparison to the shock many colleges are expecting in the fall, when social distancing measures and a possible second wave could create the most surreal semester ever.

That strangeness, experts project, could in turn cause a massive drop in college revenue. Well-endowed colleges and big research schools have the savings to weather those effects. But many schools are beholden to semi-annual tuition payments, which are about to undergo the biggest shock since the Second World War.

The result could see the shuttering of many universities, particularly small liberal arts colleges, accelerating a trend of rising closures since the Great Recession. At the same time, experts predict, the drop off in demand will be temporary, as a prolonged recession sends millions back to school—resulting in renewed profits, and power, for the schools that make it through to the other side.

When 20 million college students return to school this fall, their campuses will look very different. Schools are considering shortened school years, smaller class sizes, and keeping classes partially virtual. In addition to social distancing measures, Purdue University will use its on-campus laboratory to test students and trace contacts. The California State University system will be entirely online through the fall—its University of California sister schools are expected to follow suit.

These changes will radically alter not just campus life, but schools' balance sheets.

Added safety measures mean more expenses, Brown education professor Susanna Loeb told the Free Beacon. Colleges will need to pay fixed costs, like staff salaries and facilities maintenance, while simultaneously spending more on cleaning, testing, and added space for socially distanced classes and living. At the same time, money will stop flowing in; Robert Kelchen, a professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, said that colleges are expecting a 20 to 30 percent drop in revenue next year.

The net effect will be monumental. Hundrieser, whose organization represents over 1,900 schools, predicted that the crisis ""will transform the finances of a lot of institutions, and they'll have to be incredibly fiscally prudent and innovative in order for them to rebound in a year.""

""The effects of this crisis are likely to be much larger than the Great Recession,"" Kelchen said.

Universities, Kelchen explained, have four sources of income: tuition, public funding, on-campus fees (for housing, food services, etc.), and donations/endowments. Those funding streams are not equally distributed, however. Among 768 endowments surveyed by NACUBO, more than half of the value was held by the top 25, just 3 percent of schools.

Research funding is similarly concentrated: Data from the National Science Foundation show that the top 5 percent of recipient universities get over 60 percent of federal research dollars.

Wealthy Harvard or well-funded Johns Hopkins can smooth the coming bumps. But most colleges are dependent on either state budgets that are rapidly drying up, or on tuition and activities payments.

That explains why universities are scrambling to reopen. As Brown University president Christina Paxson wrote in the New York Times, ""remaining closed in the fall means losing as much as half of our revenue."" Even larger schools are afraid. Cornell University has a $7.3 billion endowment, but its president recently wrote that without a reopening, the school is looking at ""hundreds of millions"" in losses.

Unfortunately, absent a medical miracle, any reopening will only be partial—which still means substantial losses.

College costs a lot, over $40,000 at the average four-year school. For that much money, students expect the full package: not just classes, but the extracurriculars, parties, and social connections that come with attending a college.

Corona-college will be nothing like that, leaving many education consumers considering other options. Some will just be unwilling to keep forking out for online courses: Georgia resident Alex Popovich told the Free Beacon that his daughter, who is a freshman at William & Mary, is considering taking a semester off or taking classes at a local university in the fall if her school remains online.

Others are worried about in-person education: Thirty-five percent of students in a recent poll said that if colleges reopened in the fall, they would either only attend online (31 percent) or not attend at all (4 percent). Others are indecisive. One in six were considering taking a gap year as of April.

Those numbers might change further as it becomes apparent that many classes will remain online—63 percent of current students say e-learning is worse than in-person classes. Tuition will also be disproportionately affected by declining foreign enrollment, as foreign students generally pay full price.

Even if colleges manage a partial reopening, therefore, they will inevitably take a hit to their revenue. That's a recipe for financial disaster. As Paxson put it, ""It’s not a question of whether institutions will be forced to permanently close, it’s how many.""

Which colleges will be hardest hit? Kelchen said he was most worried about ""small, rural private colleges,"" where students will be less willing to travel to or live. Losing tuition and housing revenue, Kelchen said, ""will be more than these colleges can handle.""

Beth Akers, a higher education fellow at the Manhattan Institute, thinks the colleges most at risk are ""the expensive institutions that are offering that kind of boutique college experience, but ones that aren't sitting on the pile of cash that could help them weather this kind of storm."" Loeb noted that ""many small liberal arts schools"" were in financial straits even before the crisis began, adding ""that difficulty will likely increase.""

Will all of this mean the end of college education? Probably not—paradoxically, colleges which weather the crisis may find themselves on the other side with too many students, not too few. If one in six students take a gap year, then the fall of 2021 will see student populations swell.

There will be even more students if the current financial crisis persists and, as experts project, unemployment remains elevated. That's because in a recession, people return to school; college enrollment rose by 13 percent between 2007 and its peak in 2011.

""People like to go back to school"" when unemployment is high, education policy expert Preston Cooper told the Free Beacon. ""They say, ‘the labor market's really weak right now, there aren't a lot of job opportunities, this is my opportunity to go back and get that degree I always wanted.'""

Many of those who return will go back for associate's degrees, as enrollment in two-year colleges rose disproportionately during the Great Recession. Online colleges will likely also do well, as they have the infrastructure in place to absorb recession demand immediately. But high-prestige universities will benefit indirectly. The same demand, paired with lower supply, will necessarily lead potential students to attach more value to degrees.

Higher education resembles many other industries facing the coronavirus crisis. The small players look set to be decimated by the coming storm, while the ones that are big and wealthy enough to survive will wield even more power on the other side.",fake

(Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, as the department store chain’s stores remained shut for most of the first quarter due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

The company had earlier withdrawn its full-year forecast, suspended share buyback plan and borrowed money to combat the pandemic’s impact. The company said it ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash at hand.

The results come at a time peers when J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney (JCP.N) have filed for bankruptcy protection due to huge losses.

Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s was forced to close all its stores in the United States to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company is now reopening some stores across the country, while online operations remain open.

Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company has reopened about 50% of its U.S. stores.

Kohl’s said net sales fell to $2.16 billion from $3.82 billion a year earlier.

For the quarter ended May 2, the company reported net loss of $541 million, or $3.50 per share, compared with a profit of $62 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, it lost $3.20 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of a $1.80 loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients. Interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells particularly the enterocytes of the small intestine also express ACE2 receptors. Role of the gut microbiota in influencing lung diseases has been well articulated. It is also known that respiratory virus infection causes perturbations in the gut microbiota. Diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota which can influence immunity. Gut microbiota diversity is decreased in old age and Covid-19 has been mainly fatal in elderly patients which again points to the role the gut microbiota may play in this disease. Improving gut microbiota profile by personalized nutrition and supplementation known to improve immunity can be one of the prophylactic ways by which the impact of this disease can be minimized in old people and immune-compromised patients. More trials may be initiated to see the effect of co-supplementation of personalized functional food including prebiotics/probiotics along with current therapies.",fake

As a reminder, China didn’t inform the world about the evidence of human to human transmission (which they likely possessed for 6+ weeks at that point) until Jan. 22.

Despite all of this, Democrats have taken a distinctly “soft on China” tack, in opposition to President Trump’s increasing hawkishness, even going so far as to side with the CCP (which, remember, just put 1 million+ Muslims into concentration camps) over the White House, as the National Review pointed out in a recent article.

Humans around the world are stuck inside due to the coronavirus. How is the natural world reacting in the absence of all the noise we usually make?

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Life on lockdown inside our homes might be noisy. Outside, the streets and skies are noticeably quieter, and because there's less human sound out there, many people are hearing more wildlife. As Invisibilia's Abby Wendle reports, the relationship between human noise and the rest of nature is often discordant. So is our quiet in this moment having any impact?

ABBY WENDLE, BYLINE: The Internet is humming with rumors of animals reclaiming cities and towns. Dolphins are allegedly swimming in Venetian canals, black bears are supposedly raiding trash cans in LA, and mountain goats have been seen descending the Welsh hills to stroll through town. Some of these quarantine silver lining stories have been debunked, though for now, at least, the goats seem legit. But other anecdotes about nature being more present in the absence of humans come from reliable sources. NPR's own Eleanor Beardsley observed, for the first time in years, birds singing throughout Paris.

ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: But what really blew my mind is I'm sitting by the Seine River right now on a sunny evening, and I just heard a river bird - like, egrets on poles and stuff.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

BEARDSLEY: Is that not wild? I have never heard that before.

BERNIE KRAUSE: Yeah. We can hear subtlety of life around us that we haven't heard in a long, long time.

WENDLE: This is Bernie Krause, one of the founders of a field called soundscape ecology that studies how all the sounds in an ecosystem interact with each other and with us. Krause has been recording the natural world for more than 50 years, and in that time he's observed lots of ways our noise is disruptive to wildlife.

KRAUSE: Let's see if I have the frogs and jet flyover.

WENDLE: He tells this one story of how, back in the 1990s, he was recording thousands of frogs that gather in the spring at Mono Lake in California and croak in unison.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: Notice how they sound really big.

WENDLE: Almost like all the little frogs have joined together to become one giant frog. It's actually a defense mechanism - helps keep predators from locating and attacking individual frogs. But Krause says the military started doing test flights over Mono Basin, and the roar of the jets would cause the frogs to fall out of sync.

(SOUNDBITE OF FROGS CROAKING)

KRAUSE: They would take, like, 45 minutes before they could get in sync again. And during that period of time, we watched as a couple of great horned owls and a coyote came in and picked off a couple of frogs.

WENDLE: Eventually, this led to significant population decline all because of a jet. But Krause says it's not just jets. It's helicopters and chainsaws and tractors and traffic.

KRAUSE: I mean, just endless amounts of noise.

WENDLE: Until now. With billions of people stuck inside, our noise print is dramatically quieter. In Paris, for instance, a group that monitors noise pollution saw as much as a 90% drop in human sounds since the city went on lockdown. So how is this relative quiet impacting wildlife?

MEGAN GALL: There was a question trending on Google. Are birds singing louder?

WENDLE: This is Megan Gall, a sensory ecologist and professor at Vassar College.

GALL: If anything, I would actually guess that the birds are not singing as loud.

WENDLE: That's because, Gall says, they aren't having to compete against human sound, which could be a good thing for the birds.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

WENDLE: For one thing, Gall explains, noise has been shown to increase stress hormone responses in birds, which affects immune function. So less noise right now might equal less illness. Plus, birds living in bustling cities or even busy suburban neighborhoods have to expend a lot of energy singing louder. So now that things are quieter, she says the birds might have extra energy to use on different things.

GALL: Like spending time foraging, saving energy to feed your kids, et cetera. So possibly, we'll see animals that have larger broods or healthier offspring. You might also get changes in how females are selecting mates. Now, a lot of that's speculation, of course, but I think there's a lot of really interesting things that could be happening.

WENDLE: While how this all plays out for wildlife is, for the time being, left to informed speculation, one impact of our stillness is ringing clear as a bell.

So the Earth is, like, literally humming underneath of our feet.

ANDY FRASSETTO: That's right. Yep.

WENDLE: Andy Frassetto a seismologist who recently observed, along with colleagues in Brussels and California, a huge drop in human-caused vibrations on the Earth's crust.

FRASSETTO: It was impressive. It was just a reminder that we as a civilization have a noticeable imprint on the world in ways that, sometimes, we don't appreciate.

WENDLE: I, for one, did not appreciate that humans rattle the earth like a tiny earthquake, but we do, mostly from transportation. Automobiles, planes, trains, even our walking registers on seismographs as a kind of constant static. And now that static is way less noisy, giving seismologists a unique opportunity to perhaps detect more subtle vibrations that usually get drowned out, like the ones coming from inside volcanoes close to cities.

FRASSETTO: I think it's an open question how strong this change is, but it's something that I know people in the seismology community are really interested in exploring.

WENDLE: And some scientists are attempting to measure this strange and profound sonic experiment above ground. The Silent Cities project is a call for scientists, journalists, artists, really anyone with good enough audio equipment to record what they're hearing while stuck at home.

AMANDINE GASC: To me, it's very peaceful to walk and, like, able to, like, hear the teeny tiny sounds.

WENDLE: Amandine Gasc is a soundscape ecologist in southern France who helped create the project.

GASC: Like insects moving in leaves, for example, buzzing in the flowers - also, it's spring right now, so it increase also the noise, the wildlife sounds you can hear.

WENDLE: So far, participants are recording at 161 locations all over the world, and the data - an expected 35,000 hours or more of audio - will be available for any researcher who wants to analyze it in the future. Listening to our new sound environment is not just for researchers, though. Ecologist Megan Gall says it can be for everyone.

GALL: One of the potentially positive things that could come out of this is that people are having a chance to interact with the world around them in a way that they maybe haven't interacted with it before.

WENDLE: And those interactions could lead people like Eleanor Beardsley to not only consider the wildlife around them now - the birds singing on the Seine - but help them keep it in mind as things get back to being noisier.

BEARDSLEY: It makes me feel like they're here, and we don't pay attention to them. And we need to because they deserve to have the city as well. It's their land, too.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

BEARDSLEY: There he goes. Isn't he cute?

WENDLE: Yes, he is. In this incredibly scary and overwhelming time, he's a refuge.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLING)

SHAPIRO: That's Abby Wendle. The new season of NPR's Invisibilia is out now. You can hear it wherever you listen to podcasts.

Floyd Cardoz was an influential chef who married regional Indian cuisine with French and new American flavors. He died Wednesday morning of complications from the coronavirus in New Jersey, at age 59. He opened a string of acclaimed restaurants in both New York and Mumbai — and became a TV star along the way.

Cardoz was born in what was then Bombay, India, and grew up between that metropolis and his ancestral state of Goa. He took up cuisine against the wishes of his father. After training in Bombay and later in Switzerland, he came to New York. In 1998, he opened an influential fusion restaurant in Manhattan called Tabla with restaurateur Danny Meyer — the first in a string of innovative dining spots in both New York and Mumbai. In her review of Tabla for the New York Times, critic Ruth Reichl wrote: ""This is American food, viewed through a kaleidoscope of Indian spices. The flavors are so powerful, original and unexpected that they evoke intense emotions.""

He also became a television favorite. In 2011, he won Bravo's ""Top Chef Masters."" Earlier this month, he was in India to open a new venture. On Instagram, he was also sharing images from shooting an episode of the Netflix program Ugly Delicious with actor Aziz Ansari. On March 17, however, he shared that he had returned to the U.S. for medical treatment on March 8, writing that he was ""feeling feverish.""

Mexico’s culture secretary confirmed the singer’s death, but the Social Security Institute would not comment on local media reports saying he died Thursday of complications from COVID-19. A note on Chavez’s personal twitter account, signed by his staff, said he had been hospitalized Wednesday with symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Chávez was best known for folk-style songs lampooning Mexico’s corrupt political elite. One such song was “La Casita” (“The Little House”), which described an imaginary politician’s mansion.

Culture Secretary Alejandra Frausto wrote in her Twitter account: “Thank you, Oscar Chávez, your life was journey worthy of you! My deepest sympathy to your relatives, friends and companions in struggle and song.”

Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez wrote: “I have learned to my deep regret that a voice of the struggle has been silenced. My deepest sympathy to the family of Oscar Chávez.”

Chávez sang ballads since the 1960s and played in public as recently as 2019.

Mexico has reported 19,224 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,859 deaths.

Between 4.6 to 5.5 million people could be hospitalised under this scenario, severely straining limited health resources.

Nearly 250 million people could catch the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 aka SARS-CoV-2) across the African continent, with up to 190,000 of them dying if African countries don’t receive the support that they require. This is according to the latest peer-reviewed report by experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), due to be published soon in the British Medical Journal.

Dr Humphrey Karamagi is the Team Leader for Data, Analytics and Knowledge Management in the WHO Regional Office for Africa and co-authored this latest report.

Sputnik: How will non-African countries be affected if the African continent doesn't get the support it requires to avoid the worst-case scenario that your model predicts?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: All countries of the world will be affected negatively. At present, WHO has said it anticipates the virus would be around the globe for a few years.

Africa may become a source of new infections for other regions of the world, just as other regions may be a source of new infections for Africa. The support to the African countries therefore needs to be part of the overall global response for all countries.

Sputnik: Your report says that previous predictive models have failed to adequately reflect the socio-ecological factors which are unique to many African countries.

What is different about your model that results in a more fair and accurate prediction of what we can expect to occur in Africa?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: First, it takes into consideration new information about the epidemiology of SARS-Cov_2 infection, which the other models may not have had.

Second, it incorporates the information on how the infection interacts in the body to cause severe disease, particularly in relation to the elderly, and people with obesity, diabetes or are on hypertension management.

Third, it captures a wider range of socio-ecological factors influencing transmission, all of which country specific data is used to build country-specific models of transmission.

Sputnik: What must be done to avoid the worst-case scenarios of healthcare systems being overstretched due to the COVID-19 outbreak?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Effective public health measures focusing on the need to test, isolate, treat and quarantine suspected cases. The aim is to interrupt transmission enough to reduce the risk of infection to a level where a country can effectively respond to the cases its health system can manage. This will avoid unnecessary deaths and costs.

Sputnik: The African continent appears to have suffered less from COVID-19 compared to Europe, the US and parts of Latin America thus far.

Why is that? Could it be that a lack of sufficient testing is hiding the true figures of those who have contracted the virus?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: There are a number of potential explanations:

First, it could be that Africa is still at the early phase of the pandemic that Europe and America went through given its lower rate of transmission postulated from the model. Cases are now increasing in countries where public health containment measures are not effective and reducing in countries where they are (like Mauritius, Eritrea).

Secondly, levels of testing are very low in some countries and many cases may not be detected. As seen in the rest of the world, it is important to have expansive testing in order to identify and respond to cases.

Sputnik: Is your model open source and can its assumptions and data can be scrutinised and evaluated?

Dr Humphrey Karamagi: Obviously it is, and has even been peer reviewed by independent experts. All countries have received and are using it through the WHO Country Offices.",fake
1563,226,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/hcq-effective-covid-19-small-trial/,2020-04-02,HCQ Effective For COVID-19 In Small Trial,"Patients in China with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/hydroxychloroquine were observed to have a shorter time to clinical recovery as well as improved pneumonia in a randomized trial. HCQ is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus.

Those that received hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment were observed to have had a significantly shorter time to body temperature recovery of about one day as well as a significantly reduced time to cough remission of about a day compared to patients receiving only the standard treatment according to reports from Zhan Zhang, MD of Wuhan University.

A larger proportion of patients in the group receiving the hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment had improved pneumonia compared to those in the control group, according to a manuscript posted on the medRxiv preprint server.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been getting much attention lately, and the FDA is looking into conducting randomized trials against COVID-19, it is worth noting that some hospital have begun using a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis, and there are unconfirmed reports of some even using off label use of these agents.

Due to the attention the CDC has issued a warning to people against taking medications/remedies that they don’t understand as one unfortunate person died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate which is used to clean fish tanks, but thought it was the product getting all the attention in the media.

Previous trials exploring the in vivo activity of HCQ had found no benefit in clinical measures or viral clearance compared to standard care. The drug continues to be tested in trials including this randomized trial involving 62 hospitalized patients who were tested and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. All patients received standard care including oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin with/without corticosteroids: those in the intervention groups also received 400 mg tablets of oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate per day on days 1-5.

Primary endpoint was time to clinical recovery which was defined as being the ""return to body temperature and cough relief, maintained for more than 72 [hours]."" The mean patient age was 45 and almost half were men, with no significant differences in the age and sex distribution between the groups according to the authors.

4 of the 62 patients in the control group were noted to progress to severe illness, and 2 patients reported having mild adverse reactions ( rash and headache) in the HCQ group. Those in the HCQ group had a one day shorter time to body temperature recovery and similar results were seen for time to cough remission.

Retinopathy is a known side effect from long term therapy with hydroxychloroquine which can often be seen in lupus patients who may remain on the drug for years. Those on long term use may also experience arrhythmias, gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, and liver dysfunction. Patients on hydroxychloroquine therapy should be monitored for adverse reactions, but according to Zhang and colleagues the ""short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.""

The authors concluded that ""considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management,” while also acknowledging there is still a need for large scale clinical trials and other research to clarify the treatment mechanisms and to optimize the treatment plan.

The U.K. will most likely fail to strike a new trade agreement with the European Union by the end of the year, analysts said, as the coronavirus crisis threatens to derail official trade talks.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to conclude a post-Brexit trade deal this year. The U.K., which left the bloc on Jan. 31, is in a transition phase until December. During the transition, it is working to establish trade arrangements with the 27-nation EU.

However, this timeline is now at risk after the two lead negotiators had to isolate due to Covid-19 infections.

""The pandemic has completely taken over the agenda in both the EU and in London, and relegated the Brexit talks to a secondary issue,"" Constantine Fraser, European political analyst at research firm TS Lombard, told CNBC on Thursday.

""It was always going to be difficult to reach an agreement in the limited time available this year. The pandemic means it will now be impossible.""

British and European negotiating teams held a call on Wednesday for the first time since both lead negotiators were forced to self-isolate.

The EU's negotiator, Michel Barnier, tested positive for the virus in March but he has now recovered. The U.K.'s Johnson announced he had also tested positive for the virus last month. He was discharged from hospital on April 12 after three nights in intensive care, and continues to recover.",real

This briefing has ended. Follow our live national updates and global coverage on the coronavirus epidemic.
As millions more Americans lose their jobs, more federal aid is uncertain. The harsh economic toll of the social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic was underscored on Thursday when the Labor Department reported that another 6.6 million people had filed for unemployment benefits last week.
That brought the number of Americans who had lost their jobs over the past three weeks to more than 16 million, which is more job losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The dire figures suggested that Washington’s recent $2 trillion relief package was not working quickly enough to halt the economic devastation and the hemorrhaging of jobs in nearly every type of industry.
But efforts to bolster the relief package stalled in Washington. The Trump administration asked Congress to quickly approve $250 billion in spending to replenish a new loan program for distressed small businesses, but it hit a roadblock in the Senate on Thursday morning after Republicans and Democrats clashed over what to include.
Democrats want to double the size of the new emergency relief bill by adding $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local governments, which are facing enormous shortfalls as the outbreak drives their expenses up and their tax collections down.
Republicans argued that the small business program had a more urgent need for funds, and that additional demands for aid could be addressed in future legislation.
With Congress in recess and lawmakers scattered around the country, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, tried to push through the small business loan funding during a procedural session, a maneuver that would have required all senators to agree. But Democrats objected.
The House, which is scheduled to convene Friday in a procedural session, is not expected to try to pass either party’s proposal.
With help from Congress uncertain, the Federal Reserve on Thursday took action on its own round of emergency measures to help the economy. The central bank said it would use Treasury Department funds to buy municipal bonds and expand its purchases of corporate bonds. The efforts are aimed at shoring up companies as well as state and local governments, whose budgets are strained.
Positive coronavirus tests rise with age, White House data shows.
The White House coronavirus task force released a breakdown of testing data on Thursday, revealing that older Americans who are tested for the virus are more likely to test positive than other age groups.
Among people who were tested:11 percent of those under 25 were positive.17 percent of those between 25 and 45 were positive.21 percent of those between 45 and 65 were positive.22 percent of those between 65 and 85 were positive.24 percent of those over 85 were positive.Tests for the coronavirus are provided if people show symptoms such as a dry cough, fever or shortness of breath. Women are slightly more likely to get tested than men, although men seem to be more susceptible to the coronavirus, said Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House. Among women who were tested, 16 percent were positive; 23 percent of men who were tested had coronavirus infections.
The data, while disturbing, does not come entirely as a surprise. Similar trends have been observed in China and Italy, where men were both infected and succumbed to the coronavirus at higher rates than women.
“To all of our men out there, no matter what age group, if you have symptoms, you should be tested,” Dr. Birx said.
But one American man did not seem all that excited about wide-scale testing: President Trump.The president expressed reluctance to wait for comprehensive national testing before reopening the country for business and social life again. While he boasted that testing has increased drastically in recent days, he said it would be implausible to expect that the whole country could be screened for the virus as a condition of restoring normal life.
“Do you need it? No,” he said at his daily briefing. “Is it nice? Yes. We’re talking 325 million people. That’s not going to happen, as you can imagine.”
Even though more than 1,000 people are now dying every day in the United States, new infections have slowed in places where stringent measures have been in place for more than two weeks, offering some hope.
OPEC and Russia reach a deal to cut oil production amid lower demand.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others including Russia on Thursday reached an agreement to temporarily cut large volumes of production, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
OPEC and the other oil-producing countries agreed to cut about 10 million barrels a day, or about 10 percent from normal production levels, in May and June, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made official.
Possible further trims could come from a meeting of the Group of 20 nations on Friday.The Saudis have been engaged in a price war with Russia after Moscow refused to go along with a Saudi proposal in early March to trim output to deal with the effects of the pandemic. The spat threatened to swamp oil markets with vast oversupplies of crude.
Still, crude oil prices fell sharply on Thursday afternoon, in part because the production cuts were not expected to offset the fact that slowing economies and virus-related shutdowns have dampened demand for oil.
Stocks rose on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced an expansion of its emergency lending powers in another bid to backstop the U.S. economy, but the gains faded in the afternoon after oil prices fell and shares of energy companies followed.
Still, the S&P 500 rose about 1.5 percent, bringing its gains this week to 12 percent. Markets in the U.S. are closed on Friday, ahead of Easter.
New York State and Pennsylvania set single-day records.
The number of patients hospitalized with the virus in New York State on Wednesday rose by only 200 from the previous day, the governor said Thursday, the smallest increase since before the statewide lockdown, even as he announced that 799 more people — another bleak record — had died.
The state’s fatality count increased to 7,067. For the second consecutive day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the toll of the virus to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, calling the outbreak a “silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11.”
Although the governor said that some data, like the shrinking number of hospital admissions, suggested that New York was making headway, he warned against relaxing compliance with restrictions.
“The moment you stop following the policies, you will go right back and see that number shoot through the roof,” Mr. Cuomo.
At the same time, other New York officials have begun to cautiously envision an eventual return to some normalcy.
With transmission still widespread, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said Thursday that he thought the city could move as early as mid-May to the next stage: one with low-level spread of the virus, in which cases could be more easily traced.
“We can say that it’s time to start planning for the next phase very overtly,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference.
Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey on Thursday cited progress in the fight against the virus, even as he reported that another 198 people in the state had died.
In Pennsylvania, health officials on Thursday announced 1,989 new cases for a total of 18,228, the largest single-day jump so far. The number of cases in the state has doubled in a week, up from around 7,000 on April 2. The number of known deaths has also surged more than threefold in the same period, to 338 from 90.
At a White House briefing on Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence said Philadelphia had emerged as “an area of particular concern,” though local officials have pushed back against characterizing the city as a hot spot.
The outbreak spreads to the South, ‘a uniquely vulnerable population.’
With the virus spreading quickly across the South and expected to peak there in the next few weeks, public health experts said they were especially concerned about the toll it might take on an already vulnerable and at-risk population.
In the South, particularly in rural areas, dozens of hospitals have shuttered over the last decade. There are fewer insurance options for the poor, and the region has entrenched poverty and health issues, including high rates of diabetes and other ailments that worsen the effects of Covid-19.
Six of the nation’s poorest states are in the South, and the region is home to seven of the 10 unhealthiest states, according to the latest annual ranking by the United Health Foundation, which takes into account a mix of public health policy, environmental conditions and behaviors.
“I really don’t think we can say strongly enough that we are a uniquely vulnerable population here,” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said in a recent briefing.
Critics said governors who delayed issuing orders to keep residents at home created a disadvantage in confronting the pandemic. All but one of the southern states has since announced shelter-in-place orders, with Arkansas the lone holdout.
California’s governor defends his decision to send ventilators to other states.
California’s decision to ship hundreds of ventilators to other states this week has been met with alarm by some local officials, who expressed concern about a shortage.
Earlier this week, workers packed the equipment for heavily hit states like New York and New Jersey and wrote messages of support on the boxes. “Prayers from the West Coast,” one read.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said a total of 500 ventilators would be split among Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. He described the shipments as a loan.
But in places like Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, officials expressed concern about a “fragile” supply chain. Hospitals there were anxiously preparing for a shortage in ventilators, they said.
Riverside County has been among the hardest hit in California, with more than 1,100 cases, at least 32 deaths and an outbreak at a nursing home that forced evacuations this week after a beleaguered and sickened staff failed to show up two days in a row.
County officials said this week that the state had denied its request for ventilators, and that a second one was pending.
At his daily news briefing on Thursday, Mr. Newsom sought to allay those concerns and pushed back against the idea that the state was neglecting its own needs, although he did not name Riverside or Santa Clara Counties.
“It was the right thing to do, and it was the responsible thing to do as Americans,” he said. “We can’t just sit on assets when we could save lives in other states.”
Mr. Newsom also said he was encouraged by — but not drawing too many conclusions from — the state’s first drop in the number of coronavirus patients who were being treated in intensive care units.
He said there were 1,132 people receiving intensive care as of Thursday, a 1.9 percent decrease from the day before.
“One data point is not a trend,” he warned. “One data point is not a headline, so I caution anybody to read too much into that one point of data, but nonetheless it is encouraging and it just again reinforces the incredible work that all of you are doing.”
The modeling curve of coronavirus cases, he said, had been “bent” by the efforts of Californians who have been following suggested practices like staying indoors, avoiding other people and washing their hands.
A Louisiana lawmaker becomes the latest state legislator to die from the virus.A Louisiana state representative died this week from the coronavirus, according to his son, the latest sign that the pandemic is making incursions into the nation’s state legislatures.
The representative, Reggie Paul Bagala, was elected last year to represent Jefferson and Lafourche Parishes.
Mr. Bagala, a conservative businessman who also worked in local government, had been on a ventilator at Ochsner St. Anne Hospital in Raceland, La., according to his son, Tristan Paul Bagala, who had chronicled his father’s battle with the virus on Facebook. He was 54, according to Nola.com.
Mr. Bagala was at least the second state lawmaker nationwide to die of the virus. On April 3, Bob Glanzer, a Republican state representative from South Dakota, died at Avera McKennan Hospital & University Health Center in Sioux Falls. He was 74 and had served in the South Dakota House of Representatives since 2017, according to Gov. Kristi Noem.
Late last month, Isaac Robinson, a first-term Democratic state representative from Michigan, died at 44. A lawyer who had worked in the labor movement, he represented Hamtramck and parts of Detroit.
Mr. Robinson’s mother, Rose Mary C. Robinson, who was herself a former state representative, told The Associated Press that although no cause was given for her son’s death, she suspected he died of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. She said he had not been tested for the virus, but had been taken to the hospital for breathing problems.
Cruise ship passengers outside Miami face a 14-day quarantine at sea.
Thirteen cruise ship passengers who have been on board the Coral Princess for more than a month will have to spend two weeks in quarantine at sea with the crew, because travel restrictions in their countries of origin prevent them from going home, the cruise line said Thursday.
The authorities in Miami, where the ship has been docked since Saturday, have not allowed the passengers to stay in local hotels, the company said.
The Coral Princess, a ship owned by the Carnival Corporation, arrived in Florida last week with more than 1,000 passengers on board — two of them dead and at least a dozen with positive tests for the coronavirus. A third passenger waited hours on the dock for an ambulance and later died in a Miami hospital.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention required the cruise company to arrange charter flights to get passengers home. But four countries that have closed their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus — Colombia, Ecuador, Russia and Serbia — would not accept the passengers, even though they are their own citizens.
After everyone else evacuated the ship over the past four days, the remaining guests were to join the crew and depart Thursday night for a 14-day quarantine at sea.
On Thursday night, the C.D.C. modified and extended its so-called No Sail Order for cruise ships in ways that appeared to bring the industry to a halt in United States ports.
The order, the C.D.C. said, “ceases operations of cruise ships in waters in which the United States may exert jurisdiction” and requires them to develop a detailed, government-approved plan to monitor and address the pandemic’s effect on their operations. Operators are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew members at American ports, or return crew members to ships, without government approval “until further notice.”
European officials agree to spend more than a half-trillion euros on economic relief.
European Union finance ministers on Thursday agreed to the outlines of a loan package worth more than half a trillion euros to help the bloc’s nations relieve the severe economic blow from the pandemic.
The measures, which must be approved by the bloc’s leaders, could total up to €540 billion, or $590 billion, a show of solidarity as the economic and health crisis brought on by the virus strains bonds among the member countries.
The agreement includes €100 billion to fund unemployment benefits, €200 billion for loans to smaller businesses, and up to €240 billion lent by the Eurozone’s bailout fund to member states, to cover potentially crippling health care-related costs.
Some details, most notably on the terms and conditions of loans to countries from the bailout fund, were still unclear and could prove contentious. Countries like Italy that are likely to tap those loans want to ensure they don’t come with austerity conditions attached.
The ministers did not agree to issue bonds backed by the entire bloc, which had come to be known as “coronabonds,” in a defeat for Italy and Spain, the two worst-hit countries. Germany, the Netherlands and other richer northern European countries had staunchly opposed joint debt issuance.
In the race for virus drugs, a scientist on the front lines is urging caution.
Insistent calls and emails pile up each day for Dr. Andre Kalil at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Patients and their doctors are clamoring for untested virus treatments, encouraged by President Trump, who said that ill patients should have ready access to experimental medicines, like the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Dr. Kalil, 54, is a principal investigator in the federal government’s clinical trial of drugs that may treat the virus. It is starting with remdesivir, an antiviral drug. The first results will be ready within weeks.
Dr. Kalil has decades of experience grappling with questions about the use — and misuse — of experimental drugs, and he has rarely been more frustrated. He has seen what happens when desperation drives treatment decisions. “Many drugs we believed were fantastic ended up killing people,” he said in an interview. “It is so hard to keep explaining that.”
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Kalil said, have never been found to work against any viral disease, including Ebola. (Malaria is caused by a parasite, not a virus.) And the drugs have side effects, some of which could be fatal.
The virus is sickening and killing low-wage workers in meat plants.
The virus has reached the processing plants where thousands of workers typically stand elbow-to-elbow to do the low-wage work of cutting, deboning and packing the chicken and beef that Americans savor.
Some plants have offered financial incentives to keep workers on the job, but the virus’s swift spread is causing illness and forcing plants to close.
Smithfield Foods’ pork plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., announced on Thursday that it would close temporarily, after more than 80 workers tested positive. Workers have come down with the disease in several poultry plants in the South, including in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee.
JBS, the world’s largest meat processor, confirmed the death of one worker at a Colorado facility and shuttered a Pennsylvania plant for two weeks. Cargill this week closed a Pennsylvania facility that produces steaks, ground beef and ground pork. Tyson Foods halted operations at an Iowa pork plant after more than two dozen workers tested positive.
“How many more have to fight for their life, how many more families got to suffer before they realize we are more important than their production,” asked Tanisha Isom, 36, a deboner at a Tyson poultry plant in Camilla, Ga., where three workers have died in recent days. She recently learned she had bronchitis and missed two weeks of work.
At some plants, workers have staged walkouts over concerns that they are not being properly protected. Industry analysts said the plant closures were unlikely to result in serious disruptions to the food supply.
The White House gave virus tests to reporters.The White House for the first time conducted rapid coronavirus tests Thursday on all journalists attending the daily briefing led by President Trump after a reporter who was in the building earlier this week fell ill.
Journalists were tested one by one in a vacant office, with results delivered before the briefing. Last week White House doctors began administering rapid tests to others who came into “close proximity” to Mr. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, but this was the first time that journalists have been tested.
An unidentified news organization employee who was at the White House as recently as Tuesday has reported experiencing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus and is expected to have test results back later on Thursday.
Also on Thursday, Melania Trump, the first lady, posted a video on Twitter advising Americans to wear face coverings in public, echoing public health recommendations that Mr. Trump has personally eschewed.
Nurses and doctors who speak out about the risks they face also risk their jobs.
Workers as varied as grocery store cashiers, customer service representatives and flight attendants have clashed with their employers, whom they accuse of failing to protect and properly value them. Amazon drew widespread attention when it fired a worker who had led a protest over health concerns at a Staten Island warehouse.
But perhaps the most curious and persistent management-labor tension has arisen among health care providers like doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of the virus battle, and their administrators.
In New York City, the center of the crisis in the United States, every major private hospital system and some public hospitals in recent weeks sent memos ordering workers not to speak to the news media.
One system, NYU Langone Medical Center, sent an email on March 27 warning that staff members who spoke to the news media without permission would be “subject to disciplinary action, including termination.” The email was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Similar lines are being drawn nationwide. A doctor in Washington State was removed from his hospital position after speaking publicly about a shortage of protective equipment and testing; the staffing firm that employed him said he was being reassigned. Nurses in Detroit recently walked off the job to protest critically low staffing after a colleague who had spoken up on the issue was fired.
The first crew member from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is hospitalized because of virus.
A sailor stricken with the virus and assigned to the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has been admitted to an intensive care unit at a Navy hospital in Guam, a Defense Department official said, marking the first hospitalization of a crew member since an outbreak began aboard the ship last month.
At least 286 members of the crew have tested positive for the virus.“The sailor tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30 and at the time of hospitalization was in a 14-day isolation period on Naval Base Guam,” Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a Navy spokesman, said in an email.
The outbreak aboard the Roosevelt has been, in many ways, a microcosm of the Defense Department’s handling of the virus within its ranks as military officials have weighed military preparedness with the health of its personnel.
The ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, was relieved after he wrote a strongly worded letter to Navy officials pleading for more help aboard the carrier. The fallout from the episode led to the resignation of Thomas B. Modly, the acting Navy secretary, this week.
Inmates test positive, setting off a protest in a Washington State prison.
Police officers fired pepper spray and “sting balls” filled with rubber pellets to quell a protest of more than 100 inmates at a state prison in Monroe, Wash., on Wednesday evening after six prisoners tested positive for the coronavirus.
Prisoners in the minimum-security unit, where the men had tested positive, set off fire extinguishers to create the appearance of smoke and then refused to leave the recreation yard, according to a statement from the state’s Corrections Department. The protest ended without injuries, but prisoner movement at the facility, which holds about 450 inmates, was restricted.
The chaos came as the nation’s jails and prisons, where prisoners often live just feet apart, faced urgent reckonings over the virus and whether they could adequately protect inmates. Some prisoners have staged hunger strikes, and the courts have been considering lawsuits seeking the release of vulnerable inmates across the country.
As of Wednesday, The New York Times had identified at least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases tied to U.S. prisons and jails, including at least 32 deaths. Those numbers are most likely a vast undercount, because some state and local agencies have not released information, and others, including the federal Bureau of Prisons, are not testing everyone who falls ill.
According to Times data, the Cook County Jail in Chicago is the largest-known source of infection in the United States. As of Thursday morning, at least 401 inmates and employees had tested positive for the virus.
Texas man is accused of falsely claiming to have paid someone to spread the virus.
A San Antonio man who became upset that so many people were crowding into grocery stores took his frustration to a criminal extreme and made an untrue claim on Facebook that he had paid someone to spread the illness, the authorities have said.
The man, Christopher Charles Perez, 39, made the false claim in the hope that it would deter shoppers from visiting the stores, and in that way keep them from spreading the contagion, according to a federal complaint.
San Antonio has been contending with a surge of infections and deaths.An outbreak at the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has claimed at least 10 lives. Four San Antonio police officers have tested positive. And as hotel-occupancy tax revenues decline, officials said on Wednesday that about 270 city employees would be furloughed on April 23.
An anonymous tipster sent a screenshot of Mr. Perez’s Facebook post on Sunday to law enforcement, officials said in a statement on Wednesday. In the post, Mr. Perez warned a grocery store chain that his “homeboys cousin has Covid-19 and has licked every thing for past 2 days cause we paid him too,” according to court documents. Mr. Perez was arrested on Tuesday.
“To be clear, the alleged threat was false,” the office of John F. Bash, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said. “No one spread coronavirus at grocery stores, according to investigators.”

1576,1727,https://truepundit.com/doctors-raise-alarm-about-health-effects-of-continued-coronavirus-shutdown-mass-casualty-incident/,2020-05-22,Doctors raise alarm about health effects of continued coronavirus shutdown: 'Mass casualty incident' – True Pundit,"More than 600 doctors signed onto a letter sent to President Trump Tuesday pushing him to end the “national shutdown” aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, calling the widespread state orders keeping businesses closed and kids home from school a “mass casualty incident” with “exponentially growing health consequences.”

The letter outlines a variety of consequences that the doctors have observed resulting from the coronavirus shutdowns, including patients missing routine checkups that could detect things like heart problems or cancer, increases in substance and alcohol abuse, and increases in financial instability that could lead to “overty and financial uncertainty,” which “is closely linked to poor health.”

“We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future health of our patients,” the doctors say in their letter. “The downstream health effects … are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.”

The letter continues: “The millions of casualties of a continued shutdown will be hiding in plain sight, but they will be called alcoholism, homelessness, suicide, heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. In youths it will be called financial instability, unemployment, despair, drug addiction, unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and abuse.

“Because the harm is diffuse, there are those who hold that it does not exist. We, the undersigned, know otherwise.”

The letter comes as the battle over when and how to lift coronavirus restrictions continues to rage on cable television, in the courts, in protests and among government officials. Those for lifting the restrictions have warned about the economic consequences of keeping the shutdowns in effect. Those advocating a more cautious approach say that having more people out and about will necessarily end with more people becoming infected, causing what National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned in a Senate hearing last week would be preventable “suffering and death.” – READ MORE

Question: I have been working from home for about a month now due to the coronavirus. It was fine at first, but I’m beginning to feel disconnected from my work and my team. How can I ensure my colleagues and I remain on the same page? Unfortunately, things are not business as usual around here. – Anonymous

Answer: I’m sorry to hear you feel disconnected. Telework is certainly not ideal for everyone – especially when it’s effectively mandated, rather than freely chosen.

If it’s any consolation, you’re not alone in your remote work difficulties. Forty-one percent of U.S. employees feel burnt out from work during this pandemic as many find themselves working longer hours and struggling to stay connected with colleagues.

In fact, it’s likely your boss is struggling with the same problem – albeit from a different perspective: 65% of employers say maintaining employee morale has been a challenge.

Here’s my advice for you: Communicate, communicate, communicate.

If you think your team is desynchronized, be sure to let your boss know. Tackling this could mean scheduling weekly meetings to discuss projects, housekeeping items or even simple check-ins. Or there may be a better way to share information by centralizing and organizing the tasks and projects you’re collaborating on.

Missing workplace banter and face-to-face interaction? Set up a video call with a co-worker and ask how he or she manages remote work. Odds are, that person may feel disconnected, too, and will be happy to hear from you – and might be able to share some remote work tips. You could even start a group instant message about recommended TV shows, books and movies to enjoy during downtime under lockdown.

Believe me, I understand the difficulties. But as a radical optimist, I can’t help but see the silver lining.

Though we may be more isolated, we’re not alone – the struggle is shared by us all. The teams that see that and come together to create connection won’t merely survive this crisis. They’ll come out the other side better because of it.

Stay strong!

Saying no: How to respond when the boss has a get-rich-quick scheme. Ask HR

At risk for COVID-19:What if you are an at-risk worker and your company won't let you work from home? Ask HR

Q: Can you be fired for not getting the flu shot or other vaccinations? – Anonymous

A: I get this question a lot lately because the whole world is searching for a COVID-19 vaccine and employers want to know whether they can mandate their employers take it once it's available. The answer is complicated, so bear with me.

Generally speaking, the answer is yes. Your employer can require or mandate a vaccine as a term and condition of employment.

For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations – such as those for tetanus, polio or measles – since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people.

I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.

There are exemptions under federal and certain state laws protecting the rights of people who wish not to be vaccinated. These exceptions require more than an employee stating a generalized belief that vaccines may be harmful. Some exemptions pertain to religious or philosophical views, though there are also medical reasons – such as an underlying condition – that could put certain vaccines out of the question.

You didn’t mention whether you are personally concerned about required vaccines. If you are, and your job requires vaccination, you will need to have a conversation with your employer about your refusal, your reasoning and whether an accommodation can be made.",real

Britain, the world’s largest offshore wind market accounting for around 40% of global capacity, plans to generate more than a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Iberdrola’s East Anglia (EA) hub project comprises three projects off the east coast of England, capable of generating a total of 3.1 gigawatts of electricity, which would make it one of the largest offshore wind projects in the world.

Under Britain’s contract for difference (CfD) scheme, qualifying projects are guaranteed a minimum price at which they can sell electricity. Renewable power generators bid for CfD contracts at auction.

“The plan is to have all of the projects fully consented in Q1 (2021)… ready to bid into the auction later in the year as the combined hub,” Jonathan Cole, Managing Director, Iberdrola Renewables Offshore Wind said in an interview.

Cole added that the project could still go ahead, even if it is unsuccessful in the auction.

“We believe super-scale developments like EA Hub will be key to Europe’s decarbonisation plans, whether it sells power via government-backed contracts or private power sales arrangements. We are looking at all options.” he said.

Construction on the project could start in 2022 and will take around four years to complete.

Iberdrola is already developing the East Anglia One project in the same region and Cole said the last of the 102 turbines was installed last month.

The 714 megawatt project will be fully operational in the next few months, he said.

1585,1446,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/19/white-house-coronavirus-economic-recovery/,2020-05-19,"President Trump’s senior advisers now predict swift economic recovery, despite warnings that major problems could persist","“It almost feels like today is the first day,” Trump said during a White House meeting on Monday. “People are starting to go out. They’re opening. They get it.”



The White House’s rosy view of the U.S. economy’s trajectory clashes with the dire predictions of many mainstream economists, as well as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.



Powell said last week that lawmakers should strongly consider passing additional stimulus measures to avoid a severe and prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate rocketed from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, and it is projected to continue climbing.

Many economists and Wall Street analysts say the unemployment rate could remain above 10 percent into 2021 — a level unseen since the Great Depression — even if lawmakers approve more emergency aid. Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview that it could eclipse 25 percent later this year.



White House economic officials believe some of these trends can be quickly reversed. They are monitoring the reopening of states such as Georgia and Texas with cautious optimism that they could presage a broader recovery, according to two people in communication with them who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.



On Monday, White House economist Kevin Hassett cited what he called positive economic trends in retail, business reopenings, and credit card transaction data over the past two weeks. He said the administration has “a little bit of a luxury to watch and see” before having to approve additional aid.

“I’ve been really positively impressed by how quickly things are turning around,” Hassett told reporters on Monday. He added at a separate White House event: “I was pretty depressed about how bad it looked a few weeks ago, but you can really see it turning on faster than I thought.""



Numerous economists and the leader of the nation’s central bank are strongly warning against too sunny a view of the economic recovery. Critics say Trump and his aides have for months overstated how quickly the economy might rebound, and the White House risks exacerbating the already devastating economic impact of the virus by delaying additional emergency assistance.



Few economists outside the White House are talking about a “V” shaped recovery anymore, a scenario in which the economy rebounds just as quickly as it plummeted. Analysts believe major threats to the economy will persist even if states fully relax their public health restrictions because many Americans will not quickly return to work and consumer spending will lag.



The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected an unemployment rate of above 10 percent for 2020 and 2021. Goldman Sachs has similarly projected the unemployment rate could remain at 10 percent by the end of this year, even with an additional aid package.

Powell has urged Congress and Trump to consider spending more money to aid the economy. In the “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday, he urged lawmakers to focus on helping the unemployed pay their bills and assisting small businesses, many of which can only partially reopen. He warned the recovery is likely to be slow and could take until the end of 2021.



“If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there’ll be longer-term damage to the economy. The recovery will be slower,” Powell said in the “60 Minutes” interview. “The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now.""



The White House appears to be unlikely to approve help soon. Administration officials aren’t engaged in serious negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over the $3 trillion aid package approved by the House on Friday, according to a congressional aide.

The rate of economic growth probably will increase in the third quarter, analysts say, but even a dramatic increase may be insignificant given the steep contraction in the period from April to June. Among economists at big companies, 86 percent expect the U.S. economy will decline between March 2020 and March 2021, according to a survey of more than 100 economists last month who are part of the National Association of Business Economics.



“What matters to people is not GDP rates, seasonally adjusted at an annual growth rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “It is the labor market and unemployment and jobs. And it’s very likely that, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate could still be north of 10 percent.”



When the unemployment rate is high, Americans tend to pull back markedly on spending, which creates a huge drag on the economy. It can take a long time for consumer confidence to recover, a necessary step before Americans begin resuming sizable purchases.

On Monday, White House officials voiced increasing optimism about the economic recovery despite these dire predictions. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, cited improvements in housing and gasoline demand, as well as an increase in the New York State manufacturing index.



“Unemployment claims look terrible, but they look a lot less terrible,” Kudlow said at a White House event with restaurant executives. “Things are starting to turn — that’s my take.”



Trump has for weeks been the leading cheerleader of a rapid economic recovery, saying in early April it will take off “like a rocket ship” after the virus is contained. The president’s confidence in a “spectacular” economic comeback is shared by White House officials, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to the White House at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

“From the people at the White House I talked to over the weekend, there’s a renewed sense of optimism that things are working out,” Moore said. “They feel like the direction of things is good, very positive, in terms of the sense of crisis is lessening, and that this is playing up pretty much as had been hoped.”



White House officials have maintained they will step in and approve more aid if subsequent economic data shows it is necessary. Mnuchin has also proved willing to negotiate with congressional Democrats, helping to spearhead the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March.



Hassett said existing federal efforts have involved “really, really big — massive interventions” bigger than the efforts in the New Deal of the 1930s.

“It’s at least appropriate to see how they go,” Hassett said.

Some White House officials have also quietly signaled their openness to additional aid for states and cities, despite internal angst among some senior advisers about the growing deficit, suggesting the administration’s flexibility on additional spending measures. There is growing concern that state budget cuts could lead to large numbers of layoffs, which could create major political problems ahead of the presidential election in November.



“I don’t think, politically, that Senate Republicans or the White House can withstand the pressure from more bad economic news and the media drumbeat suggesting more help needs to come,” one senior Republican aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe internal dynamics.

Some economists warn that delaying relief measures now could mean more economic pain for Americans later, arguing the White House does not have time to waste.

Claudia Sahm, who served as an economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration, says unemployment could rise above 30 percent without trillions more in emergency federal spending. Downplaying the extent of the economic carnage may be what the president wants to hear, Sahm said, but it could backfire if it results in slower federal action.

Trump and Kudlow have minimized or downplayed the economic threat posed by the coronavirus since the outbreak began in the United States in February, predictions that have since proved incorrect. Kudlow said in late February that the U.S. had a “pretty close to airtight” containment of the virus, which proved untrue.

At the time, the stock market appeared to be ignoring the upbeat statements from White House officials as it fell precipitously. Lately, though, the market appears to be sharing some of the White House’s optimism, even if other measurements of the economy paint a much different picture.",real

Updated at on Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET

President Trump on Friday signed Congress' latest coronavirus economic relief package, which includes additional aid to small businesses and hospitals.

The measure passed overwhelmingly in the House on Thursday — 388-5, with one lawmaker voting present.

The five lawmakers who voted against the package included one Democrat — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — and four Republicans — Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jody Hice of Georgia, Ken Buck of Colorado and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

""We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill, and I am proud of that,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who made the case for ongoing, robust federal intervention as the only way out of the crisis. Pelosi on Thursday wore a white scarf to cover her face, but lowered it to speak on the House floor.

""I think that we have to do whatever we can to recognize that public policy has a role here, that governance carries with it responsibilities and opportunity and results and progress for the American people,"" she said. ""And that science and governance are the answers to meeting the health care needs and meeting the needs of our economy as we go forward.""

The Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent on Tuesday.

The details

The $484 billion package includes an additional $321 billion for the newly created Paycheck Protection Program, a lending program designed to help small businesses stay afloat with forgivable loans during the crisis. PPP was popular and ran out of its initial influx of $350 billion in just two weeks. It is likely the program will need additional funding. Republicans have criticized Democrats for holding up the bill — initially a stand-alone $250 billion request to fund PPP.

In the end, Democrats secured an additional $60 billion carved out for smaller banks to assist businesses, many minority-owned, that have struggled to borrow from bigger lenders. It also includes $100 billion Democrats sought for hospitals and more testing.

They were unsuccessful, however, in their efforts to include additional resources for state and local governments — a fight they vowed to carry on to the next round of funding talks.

""There will not be another bill without state and local government"" resources in it,"" Pelosi said on Friday.

Social distancing during votes

The House debate on Thursday included stark images reflective of the time: House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow mask, as did most lawmakers and aides who appeared in the chamber. The visitors' galleries, normally open to the public, were closed.

It was the first roll call vote in the House since it approved a prior coronavirus relief bill on March 14. After that vote, two lawmakers fell ill and about a dozen others self-quarantined as a result. One of those quarantined members, Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., later tested positive for COVID-19. House leaders installed more aggressive social distancing guidelines for today's votes.

""We should be mindful of the people surrounding us,"" said House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who is leading an ongoing effort to find ways to allow lawmakers to vote and hold hearings remotely.

Members were directed to vote in smaller groups broken down by alphabetical order for each vote. Between floor speeches and votes, lawmakers were asked to stay in their offices. And members were asked to vote by machine and not a manual card that requires more contact. Short recesses were held between debates and votes to clean the chamber.

The pandemic also continues to affect lawmakers personally. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., announced on the House floor that her sister is hospitalized with COVID-19. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced that her eldest brother died from the virus on Tuesday.

Next up

This is the fourth measure Congress has approved since March 1 to confront coronavirus and the economic fallout. While all four enjoyed fast, bipartisan support, there are signals that the parties are retreating to more familiar partisan lines for an anticipated fifth package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants a ""pause"" before Congress considers additional legislation, and that it is unlikely additional measures will be able to pass the Senate by unanimous consent, which is generally reserved for noncontroversial bills. He has also indicated he will oppose any no-strings-attached funding for states and that he supports a new legal channel for states to declare bankruptcy to address their fiscal woes.

Among the measures Congress is expected to debate for inclusion in future legislation is funding for state and local governments to make up for budget shortfalls, additional cash payments to American workers and families, extended unemployment benefits, aid for the U.S. Postal Service and first responders, and new infrastructure spending.",real

Subscribe here .

Oh hey, today is our 500th issue! Thanks to everyone who has been with us from the beginning, and each of you who has joined along the way. We can’t imagine a better use of our time during this weird era than bringing you news and analysis of the day’s big moments in tech, democracy, and the pandemic.

One result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that big tech companies, which long have been reluctant to intervene in questions of content moderation, have quickly become much more aggressive. At Google, for example, the company began showing news stories from trusted sources to anyone who searched for information about the virus. It stepped up efforts to remove videos containing misinformation about the pandemic from YouTube.

YouTube also added a “shelf” of high-quality breaking news videos, along with links to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health authorities. As a result, YouTube says, news consumption is up 75 percent from this time last year, and links to the WHO and CDC have received more than 20 billion impressions.

And on Tuesday, YouTube took a step that, among the big social platforms, has so far only been implemented by Facebook: adding fact-check articles to search results. I wrote about it at The Verge:

YouTube will begin adding informational panels containing information from its network of fact-checkers to videos in the United States, the company said. The panels, which were introduced last year in Brazil and India, appear on searches for topics where fact-checkers have published relevant articles on the subject. The move comes at a time when platforms have seen a surge in misinformation related to COVID-19 and its origin, possible cures, and other subjects. [...] YouTube says “more than a dozen” US publishers are already participating in its network of fact-checkers, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The network is open to any publisher that is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and signs its code of principles. Google recently announced that it would donate $1 million to the IFCN.

On Monday afternoon, I spoke with YouTube’s head of product, Neal Mohan, about how the company is navigating several challenges related to the pandemic. We talked about evolving advice from public health organizations, scrubbing bad content from the platform, and the company’s increasing reliance on automated systems for moderation.

“When users are searching on YouTube around a specific claim, we want to give an opportunity for those fact checks to show up right then and there, when our users are looking for information — especially around fast-moving, quickly changing topics like COVID-19,” Mohan told me.

Highlights from our interview are below, edited lightly for clarity and length.

Casey Newton: You rolled out fact checks in Brazil and India last year. What did you learn?

Neal Mohan: We happened to roll it out in India right around the time of their elections last year. Those are the largest elections in the world, and as a result of the number of people that vote, the election itself occurs over the course of a month. So there was time for the potential spread of a lot of misinformation between one election date and another.

We have information panels that we triggered in the case of more evergreen conspiracies, like flat earth and anti-vaccine. But what about fast-moving, changing news events where there might not be a robust Wikipedia article or a CDC entry or an Encyclopedia Britannica article to link to? And so that’s why we leaned on this concept of actually bringing professional fact checkers into our YouTube search results and triggering them there.

And our experience both in India and Brazil was positive. We think that we did our job in terms of curtailing the spread of misinformation in an otherwise sort of pretty flammable environment. Most importantly from my standpoint, we felt that we did right by our users in terms of doing our best to try to prevent this happening in those countries. And that that sort of positive result for our users led us to expand it here in the US. And our goal is not to just stop at these three countries — we want to continue to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.

One challenge of policing information about COVID-19 is that the disease itself is new, and the advice we get keeps evolving. In some cases, advice like “don’t wear masks” has changed to “everyone please wear masks.” How should a big tech platform approach that problem?

My perspective there is that we really do have to rely on sources — and in our case, that means channels — that have a track record of being relevant and credible in this space. Yes, lots of guidelines are changing, every single day, every single week. You’re literally seeing science being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so the reason why surfacing authoritative results feels like the best thing that we can do is because even if there’s a change, an authoritative source is going to give the context behind it.

So let’s say there’s a change in mask guidance. I would expect an authoritative news outlet, or a medical authority like the CDC, to give context on it and say, ‘this used to be our guidance, and our new guidance is this, and here’s the reason why.’ Or a news publication covering it says ‘CDC changes its guidelines: this is what they used to say, now they’re saying this, and this is the science that led them to change that.’ And by surfacing authoritative results, I think we’re doing what we can as a platform to deliver the most timely, but also the most credible information to our users.

I know YouTube has also been relying on more automated systems during the past couple months due to challenges with being able to bring third-party vendors into offices. How are you measuring the effect on your moderation decisions?

A lot of of this was really very, very simple, which was protecting the health of our extended workforce. And for me and I think for everybody else here at YouTube and Google, that was really the number one consideration, and frankly everything else we were going to do was going to be secondary.

You and I have talked before about the way that [content moderation] works best is through a combination of machines and machine learning, and the nuanced judgment of well trained raters who do this for a living. Without that second part, we’ve had to rely much more on handling things through appeals. Because there’s a lot of action taken by these machines, sometimes those appeals are impacted in terms of our response time. But generally speaking, we’ve been able to manage this.

Finally, we’re in a situation in which some of the people spreading misinformation about COVID-19 are elected officials. How is YouTube approaching that when it comes to moderation?

Just to be very clear, our community guidelines are based on the content. That applies to the content within the videos, and it also applies to comments and any other surface, if you will, on the YouTube platform. And so they’re not about the speaker. The policies apply equally, whether you or I say something, an elected official does, or a national leader does. This crisis is no different.

One of the enforcement examples that we gave around medical misinformation was explicitly encouraging somebody to flout state or national guidance around a stay-at-home order. And this happened in the case of the Brazilian president.

We removed a couple of videos that happened when there was an explicit call to flout those orders. Of course, you have to strike the right balance. If there are people who have different opinions or would like to express an opinion — in terms of economic trade-offs versus health trade-offs — then that discourse needs to be allowed and protected on our platform. But something that explicitly says, through false information, that stay-at-home doesn’t actually do anything, that would be an example of a policy violation, regardless of who the speaker is.

That speed of development was highly unusual for Apple, a company obsessed with making its products perfect before releasing them to the world. Project Bubble also required that Apple join forces with its historic rival, Google, to co-develop technology that could be used by health authorities in countries around the world.

In recent weeks, the employees have been working nights and weekends to incorporate external feedback. The companies still have their critics, but the transparency has helped them win over some unlikely supporters, including in countries like Germany where officials were initially reluctant to work with Big Tech.

The departure of long-serving directors, along with those of several longtime lieutenants over the past two years, means he is navigating this moment without key advisers who might be able to help him spot potential pitfalls.

Facebook restructured some of its security teams in a move that displaces more than two dozen employees. The company said it is “investing more in automated detection” to stay ahead of evolving threats. (Sheera Frenkel and Mike Isaac / The New York Times)

WhatsApp video calls can now include up to eight people instead of just four. The new upper limit is available now on iOS, but it doesn’t appear to be available from the Google Play Store just yet. Also: I’m still waiting on my Messenger Rooms! What gives? (Jon Porter / The Verge)

Checkout.com, a British payments start-up, joined the Libra Association. I have made this joke before, but this is the traditional first step toward eventually leaving the Libra Association.

Jay-Z ordered deepfake audio parodies of himself to be taken off YouTube. His copyright claim cited an unusual reason for removal: “This content unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client’s voice.” Is this a first? (Andy Baio / Waxy)

The Academy voted to significantly ease Oscar-eligibility requirements in response to the ongoing pandemic. Now, films can qualify for the competition if they are streamed, and do not have to be screened for at least one week in a Los Angeles-area theater. This applies only to the period that theaters are closed. (Scott Feinberg / The Hollywood Reporter)

Things to do

Stuff to occupy you online during the quarantine.

Take the shower challenge, men! Is it safe for work? No. Is it safe for working from home? Also no.

Watch a late-night talk show held inside Animal Crossing. It’s hosted by the writer of Rogue One.

Attend a virtual prom in Houseparty. It takes place May 7th from 8 to 10PM ET, and will include DJs you can bring into your private chats with friends.

Buy a puzzle. Or do what I do, and play Patterned on the Apple Arcade subscription service. It’s a lot of puzzles for less than the cost of most puzzles.

1619,400,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/04/do-black-and-hispanic-lives-really-matter-to-progressives/,2020-04-22,Do Black and Hispanic Lives Really Matter to Progressives?,"A stunning report that came out in January of this year received little attention at first, and was then completely buried due to the avalanche of coronavirus-related stories. “The Secret Shame: How America’s Most Progressive Cities Betray Their Commitment to Educational Opportunity for All” compares the minority-white proficiency gap in progressive and conservative cities. And it’s no contest. America’s left-most cities are doing an awful job of educating Blacks and Hispanics.

The study, courtesy of brightbream, a “nonprofit network of education activists demanding a better education and a brighter future for every child,” maintains that progressive cities, on average, have achievement gaps in math and reading “that are 15 and 13 percentage points higher than in conservative cities, respectively. In San Francisco, for example, 70% of white students are proficient in math, compared to only 12% of black students reaching proficiency — a 58-point gap. In Washington, D.C., 83% of white students scored proficient in reading compared to 23 percent of black students — a 60-point gap. In contrast, three of the 12 most conservative cities — Virginia Beach, Anaheim and Fort Worth — have effectively closed or even erased the gap in at least one of the academic categories we examined.”

Importantly, the authors of the study controlled for factors that might bias the outcome: per-pupil spending, level of income equality, racial density et al, but they write that “controlling for these factors did not erase the correlation between a city’s progressivism and the sizable racialized gaps in educational outcomes.” Although the report shows a striking interrelationship between progressivism and failure, the researchers make no claims of causation.

There are many possible reasons for the disparity. Blogger James Bacon suggests that the left’s constant push for treating minorities as victims disempowers them. He also claims that the self-esteem crowd has done damage by lowering expectations for those considered victims of white racism.

Walter Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University, offers that crime could be a factor. Many well-meaning but destructive fads have become part of the scenario at progressive schools. “Restorative justice” and other similar non-consequences for willful defiance and worse have become the norm. As a result, discipline suffers and a few disruptors can make life miserable for behaving students and teachers alike.

I would add that teachers unions are certainly part of the problem. School boards tend to represent the political leanings of the school district’s voters. Hence, collective bargaining agreements in conservative cities like Anaheim tend to be more student-friendly than in progressive cities like San Francisco. These contracts are especially problematic in that they restrict school district efforts to use compensation as a tool to recruit, reward and retain the most effective teachers. Additionally, the ability to assign or remove teachers on the basis of fit or performance is greatly impeded.

While it’s true that all kids are negatively affected by collective bargaining, less advantaged kids don’t always have the support to compensate for it. Well-to-do parents can hire a tutor for their child if he has an under-performing teacher, for example.

Whatever the cause of the disparity, the question remains how to deal with it. The answer is simple, though politically difficult to achieve. While many public schools are burdened with collective bargaining agreements, restorative justice, promoting victimology and other pillars of progressivism, private schools are not. Hence the best thing we can do to level the playing field is to let parents choose the best school for their kid via vouchers, educational savings accounts, tax-credit scholarships, etc., and let tax dollars follow the student.

Of course, this is a bête noire for many finger-pointing progressives who nonsensically insist that privatizing education further lines the pockets of the wealthy. They also claim that choice is “racist.” But they are projecting. Until we move toward parental choice, racial disparities in progressive cities will continue unabated. Choice lifts all boats. Now if only we could get the progressives, along with the NAACP and the “Black Lives Matter” crowd to sign on, the U.S. would have a much more equitable education system.

If only.

1620,1232,https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/05/coronavirus-restarting-business-child-care-travel-restaurants.html,2020-05-17,"6,000 people on what they’re comfortable doing in our new world: A Slate survey.","As the national conversation turns, perhaps prematurely, from flattening the curve to reopening businesses and restarting life, we’re all trying to figure out which parts of normal we’re comfortable resuming. Is it OK to bubble with another family this summer? Is it fine to go to the beach? Is it time to return to the office? When can we have child care again? As we enter this next phase of the coronavirus response, what’s reasonable and what’s not seem more and more determined not by government decree but by who you are, what your circumstances require, and sometimes just by how you feel.

Late last month, we asked readers what they think they’ll be comfortable doing when their city or state lifts stay-at-home orders. In other words: When you’re allowed to do these things, will you? More than 6,100 people responded to the survey, which included questions about getting back to office work and routine errands, child care, dining and entertainment, travel, and interpersonal habits we can’t believe we had to ask about, like hugging.

This survey was designed to identify how Slate readers feel and should not be taken as representative of the U.S. population. But the results did show noteworthy patterns among respondents. A hesitation to resume activities runs deep, though people who identified as Republicans were more willing to get back to normal than those who identified as Democrats, often by margins of 20 to 30 percentage points. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to answer a question with “I don’t know.”

Some activities, such as going to movie theaters, shaking hands, or hosting parties, remain a relic of the Before Times. Others, such as going to national parks and visiting the doctor for routine checkups, seem doable to many. Men were more likely than women to pick “yes”—as in, “yes, I will do this thing”—in almost every category. Young people age 18 to 24 were more likely to say yes to getting back to the things they used to do, sometimes by large margins, particularly activities that involve socializing.

Many respondents also wrote in to explain their answers to our questions and elaborate on their feelings. Quite a few parents, such as Dina in California, wrote about their need to get their kids back to day care or school: “It’s just not healthy for any of us. … She gets way too much screen time, and we get no work done. It’s miserable and unsustainable.” Others wrote about the need to visit the doctor, get a haircut, or go back to work—with proper precautions. Will in Alabama notes that some activities might not be a choice: “My ‘Yeses’ are actually ‘Maybe, if I fucking gotta.’ ” Others, such as Gretchen from Arizona, grappled with the uncertainty and anxiety of the future: “All of my ‘I don’t knows’ are the ones that are the most emotional to me. They all seem like they are a bad idea based on the current situation, but I really don’t think I can go an entire year without hugging someone. … My parents are in their 80s, and are out of state, and I don’t want the last time I saw them to be the last time ever!” Below are the results.

Work and Routine Activities

Routine activities and errands—such as returning to the office, shopping at nonessential businesses, and getting a haircut—produced some of the most evenly divided yes and no responses, when compared with questions about kids, travel, and entertainment.

Returning to the office tied with sending kids back to school for the largest amount of uncertainty in the survey, with 20 percent of respondents checking “I don’t know.” Many people wrote that they hoped to keep working from home, some permanently, but others had bosses who’d made it clear that they were eager for employees to get back, or simply had to return for much-needed paychecks.

“I will go back to my job so I can pay rent. Period. I don’t have the option of working from home, so when my store reopens, I’ll be going back.”

—Jessica, California

“The boss of my company has informed us that we will be back in the office in two weeks, as long as the governor doesn’t extend the stay at home order, and it looks like he probably won’t. I’m concerned about it. I share an office with someone, and I’m getting some messaging from my boss about ‘clean desk initiatives’ and sanitation practices, but … if someone is an asymptomatic carrier, we are all sealed in a building getting prolonged exposure to that person, and maybe not knowing about it for weeks. I don’t understand why it’s a rush to get back in the office. We’ve been handling everything working from home.”

—Barbara, Louisiana

“I’m a psychotherapist, so to go back to the office would require me to sit in close proximity to about 20 different people a week for an hour at a time each. … As long as insurance continues to cover telehealth sessions, I will keep doing that for the foreseeable future, even though I absolutely despise doing Zoom therapy—it’s better than the alternative.”

—Marissa, Illinois

“I’m 78, have immunity issues, and have mild COPD. Getting the bug would almost certainly kill me. On the other hand, I need the money I get from working at the local supermarket. It’s going to be a tough call.”

—Norman, New York

“I’m already shopping in person at liquor stores—if I can do the mental gymnastics required to call that essential, I expect I’ll be able to go to a nonessential business like my local bookstore once it opens.”

—Margaret, Massachusetts

“I’m extremely conflicted. Personally, I want to avoid crowds and avoid being in a store where I may try on clothes someone carrying the virus just tried on. However, I’m also a fashion designer. My company, and my job stability, is partially dependent on people returning to stores. How can I want people to shop from the selfish perspective of hopefully keeping my job, while also not wanting to do that myself?”

—Jessica, New York

“It feels stupid dangerous to go to a hair salon, but I really need it for my mental health. I live alone and am getting increasingly depressed. My only coping mechanism is to put the pandemic out of my mind, but I’m reminded every time I look in the mirror or hop on a conference call. I can’t do blond at home, so I’m hoping that if my hairdresser and I both wear masks and are the only ones there, it will be OK.”

—Cece, Tennessee

“It’s insane thinking you can get personal services done like a haircut or mani/pedi while socially distancing! I’m not dying over beauty. I’ll be DIY’ing it until the virus is well under control. And the beauty police can take a hike for judging otherwise.”

—Robyn, Virginia

Our question about resuming routine doctor’s appointments got one of the highest tallies of yeses. It also offered some of the smallest margins among different demographics. Men and women said yes to going to the doctor in nearly equal numbers. It was also the smallest margin between Democrats and Republicans, with 60 percent of Democrats and 74 percent of Republicans saying they would schedule health care appointments. That still leaves plenty who remain apprehensive.

“I’m turning 40 this summer, with a family history of breast cancer, and will need to start getting mammograms. And my son needs to go to the dentist. But what is ‘necessary’ and what is ‘elective’ now?”

—Sarah, Texas

“I have chronic health issues, that while not acutely life-threatening, do significantly impact my quality of life. I was undergoing testing in order to pursue new treatment approaches when my state’s stay-at-home order was issued. It is hard to put those doctor’s appointments on hold when I know I might find a way to feel much better.”

—Breein, Idaho

Many respondents hoped for expanded absentee voting or voting by mail for the remaining primaries and the November general election. But barring that, many swore to vote by any means necessary: “swim through COVID,” “draped in plastic wrap,” and “crawl through clouds of Ebola” were just a few choice phrases respondents used to describe what they would do to vote. One notable finding: While respondents age 18 to 24 were often more likely than their elders to say they’d be comfortable resuming an activity, voting was one place where they backed off. Compared with respondents ages 25 to 65, fewer young people expressed a willingness to vote in person on Election Day. People over 65 were also less willing to venture to the polls.

“I will vote by mail but if not available because Republicans are trying to suppress voting, I will not be disenfranchised. I would rather be dead.”

—Chris, California

“I would want to show ID when I vote in person on Election Day.”

—Charlie, New York

“I would not ‘feel comfortable’ going out to vote in person. I, however, live in Mississippi and have no reason to believe that the officials of this state will make any allowances for voting other than in person. And I will vote.”

—AZ, Mississippi

Child Care

Questions about child care saw some of the thinnest gender gaps, with moms and dads in largely equal numbers wanting to send kids back to day care, school, or camp—or keep them home. Sending kids back to K–12 produced a high level of uncertainty: 20 percent of respondents said they didn’t know whether they’d send their kids if their districts reopened, the same percentage who were unsure about returning to the office. And the two are correlated for many respondents.

“I need some time away from my kids! Either a nanny/babysitter or back in school. I don’t care. I need a break!!!!!”

—Sasha, Maryland

“I wouldn’t send my kids back to day care because … my kid and his day care is bar none the reason I get sick above all others.”

—Graham, California

“I would hire a nanny or babysitter as soon as possible. … I have a newborn and a 6-year-old, and if I don’t get help soon, I see myself spiraling into [postpartum depression]. I would hire someone I trusted who is also following proper social distancing as much as possible.”

—Austin, Missouri

“Once we [send the kids to day care], we may as well do everything else. I am so tempted, because I am struggling so much with my kids, but they are so touchy-feely and unhygienic—if we send them to camp/afterschool we may as well just have a houseparty and bob for apples.”

—Brenan, Illinois

“If my office ‘allows’ us to return to work, I assume that means work from home is no longer allowed. Therefore, I would need some sort of child care, whether I felt it was safe or not. Likewise with school. I don’t have the luxury to choose not to send my children to school if schools reopen.”

—Laura, Illinois

“My high school kid is really struggling to focus in online school, and I’m at work and not able to monitor him. It feels like the same result as if he had dropped out, and I’m worried about his ability to keep up.”

—Meg, Idaho

“The kids need school and activities. My kids are 9 and 5. They have become anxious, lonely, and bored, all of which contribute to more emotional acting out and some noticeable depression (especially in the older child). It is worth the relatively small risk to send them out so that they can be more socially stable.”

—Monica, California

“My daughter has asthma and is high risk. I dread having to send her back to school before a vaccine. I may not, even if schools open. For us, this doesn’t feel theoretical—it’s life or death.”

—Monica, Washington

We also heard from a few teachers who aren’t certain about the prospect of going back.

“When we reopen, I’ll be headed to the school building, even if it’s unsafe. I’m dedicated to the kids and in a low-risk category, so if I get sick it’s likely not the end of the world. I’ll be fighting tooth and nail for safe policies, the right to wear masks (usually we’re not allowed to cover our face or heads at school except for religious reasons), and even if other teachers are relaxing the rules, I’ll be very strict with my students. They deserve to have an education without getting sick and killing their grandparents.”

—Catherine, Washington

“If schools go back in the fall, I have no choice but to be around 1,200 kids and 300 adults a day. I’m terrified, as my partner is autoimmune compromised.”

—Robin, Georgia

Few respondents will be thrilled to send their kids to day camp if allowed, and even fewer were eager to send kids to sleepaway camp. But as with sending kids back to school, many parents are relying on camps to provide summer child care.

“I said yes to a lot of kid-based [survey questions] because working full time and having a 6-year-old has been impossible. I don’t necessarily think these are the safest out of all the things listed, but I need some other form of child care, so I’m willing to take the associated risks. My daughter’s summer camp has confirmed it will run with lots of precautions in place, and I’m planning on sending her.”

—Celia, Colorado

“I don’t know if I would send my child to day camp because I worry about that being a place the virus can spread. They are outside, and that seems safer, but I don’t know that it is a place that is clean—not washing hands enough, touching shared objects. It’s hard to keep kids 6 feet apart. But if I have to go back to work full time, the only other option is sending her away to my sister, who is a teacher and would be off. And I hate the idea of not seeing my child all summer so I can work.”

—Erica, Connecticut

Dining, Entertainment, and Socializing

People age 18 to 24 were more likely than any other age group to say they are comfortable going to a restaurant, to a movie, or on a date. Entertainment-related questions also represented one of the largest gulfs between Democrats and Republicans, with Republicans expressing far more eagerness to resume these activities.

Pretty much everyone prefers outdoor to indoor dining, but there is a real partisan divide when you dig into the numbers. About 71 percent of Republicans are OK with eating outdoors at a restaurant, versus only 34 percent of Democrats; 50 percent of Republicans say “yes” to eating indoors with social distancing measures, while only 13 percent of Democrats say the same.

“I have been craving a meal at a certain Mexican restaurant that has free queso with your chips, a ‘salsa bar,’ margaritas you need two hands to hold, and the best carne asada tacos ever. It seems a small thing, but it makes me salivate to think about after over a month of cooking at home. Also, the restaurant is locally owned and operated, so my money will stay local for sure.”

—Lori, Oklahoma

“As much as I have missed eating out and want to support our local restaurants, I don’t see how they can provide the distancing and cleanliness required. We are a tourist destination with most coming from Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida. I am concerned that Georgia and Florida leadership has not taken the situation seriously and thus many tourists from those states could travel here carrying the virus into our restaurants.”

—Geneva, North Carolina

About even numbers would attend a dinner or host a dinner, but no one’s in the mood for a party, with 89 percent of respondents saying no.

“Truthfully, I don’t think I could stand the change in behavior that would be necessary for an in-home dinner party. Every interaction would be so strange—do we just freely pass dishes and wine bottles? Should we not all squeeze onto the couch for a movie night? How do board games work now? My friendships are strong enough to survive the awkwardness and boundaries, but it would be heartbreaking to pull ourselves back from connection again and again.”

—Jess, Colorado

Almost no one wants to go to a movie theater: 91 percent of respondents—the highest tally of the survey—rejected the idea of going to a theater without social distancing policies. And 71 percent of respondents are hesitant to go to the theater even with distancing measures.

“I absolutely live for movies. I’m 74. I have doubts that I will ever attend a movie again, I cannot imagine feeling safe.”

—Penny, Colorado

“I would potentially go to an outdoor concert if it was guaranteed that we would all be really spread out and there were spread-out areas for going to the bathroom so not everyone was clustered around the port-a-potties, or ideally if it was short enough that I wouldn’t need to use the restroom while I was there. And no food or beverage service because people would congregate in line. It would have to be a large venue with capacity capped at a much lower number than usual, or a small neighborhood concert in the park.”

—Kelly, Oregon

“Why not just drink a nice hot cup of Plague Espresso?”

—John, Oregon

Dating showed one of the largest gaps between men and women, with 38 percent of men and 24 percent of women willing to get back to it.

“I’m extremely single, and this experience has made me aware of how much I want a romantic relationship. Realistically, that’s going to require some physical contact at some point.”

—Yana, Pennsylvania

“I think for dates, it is just an acceptable risk for me. I cannot stay inside for forever, and I will let my date decide the level of contact they are comfortable with, but a walk outdoors seems pretty safe to me.”

—Brian, North Carolina

“I feel like dating is so awkward normally. A date right now is just going to be even more awkward. People get so weird in general when you tell them deal breakers early on. I imagine trying to have a convo about social distancing/when you can get close would just bring out everyone’s inner weirdo. I’m busy enough dealing with my own inner weirdo.”

—Brenda, Texas

“To go on a date, I’d need to know more details about the other person’s stance on mitigation/distancing. In some ways it feels like any in-person meetup logistics conversation will sound a bit like a safer sex conversation—what are your risk factors, what are your exposure risks, what are your mitigation practices, do our practices line up?”

—Mary, D.C.

Travel

Many respondents expressed concerns about crowds and only wanted to venture to places close to home. But visiting a beach or national park was one of the more acceptable activities.

“The beach is a big part of our lives. I think we could easily maintain proper social distancing while sitting under an umbrella, tossing a football, and boogie boarding. We have always tended to go to the beach before noon or after 5 p.m. anyway, just to avoid crowds and the hottest part of the day, so we’d continue to do that. It would be a huge boost to our happiness and our ability to sustain social distancing for many more weeks/months.”

—Megan, California

“Despite consistent warnings from the governor, our open space and state park trailheads have been packed. We’ve been avoiding those and will continue to do so, but we might consider doing some backcountry camping in the coming months. Definitely no campgrounds or anywhere with shared facilities.”

—Kathleen, Colorado

“I think this may be an urban/rural divide question. We live out in the sticks right near a national park, and have been going there regularly throughout lock-in. My wife and I rarely see a soul, and when we do, it’s ‘howdy!’ and wave from a distance. If we still lived in L.A.? Definitely would not be going to Venice Beach or Griffith Park, nor to our own park now if there were a bunch of people/cars. Ultimately, it’s situational.”

—Alex, Vermont

“Renting a vacation house just seems unethical right now. We don’t want to unwittingly spread the virus to rural communities just because it would be nice to get away. And going to a beach or national park also seems unnecessary. We’ll be able to do those things again but why expose others, and ourselves, to risk for something so optional?”

—Robin, Wisconsin

“For a rental vacation house, I’m fairly confident in my cleaning skills so would come prepared to clean all surfaces and bring my own linens. I might also rent Saturday but not show up until Sunday to give anything in the air time to settle. And it would have to be in driving distance and not require a stop on the way.”

—Amy, North Carolina

“What’s the point of flying anywhere or staying in a vacation house, other than to meet new and interesting people to breathe on and get breathed on by in return? And isn’t going on vacation an insult to all the people who’ve been sent on involuntary vacation over the past two months?”

—Jess, Texas

“The only reason I say I don’t know rather than no is because I already have a vacation booked for July. They make it so hard to cancel!”

—Belinda, Missouri

“I had to cancel my honeymoon because of the pandemic, and as much as I am itching to get on a trans-Atlantic flight and take a sorely needed vacation, it’s definitely not the first thing I’m doing. I want to be clear of a second wave before I get on a flight.”

—Ben, New York

“My father has been locked down in a nursing home and can no longer work a phone. So, I have to go there and see him in person to assess how he is doing. I could be risking the lives of the entire nursing home and all the workers just because I need to see my ailing father. This is a horrible Sophie’s choice, and I really should not do it, but I know I will.”

—Mark, Texas

“I am terrified to visit my 86-year-old grandmother. We just lost my grandfather in December of 2019. Now not only can we not visit her, but she is also alone for the first time in 60 years. It breaks my heart that she is alone and sad. The idea of losing Gram is terrifying, so I am staying away.”

—Melissa, Montana

“My mother is 91 (and a half!) years old and lives in a different state. We had to cancel our trip to see her in April. The last thing I want to do is go visit her and carry the virus to her, in which case she would likely die from it. … But let’s face it, at her age every day is a gift, and I don’t want to put off visiting her for so long that she dies in the next year while I wait for a vaccine, meaning I would never see her alive again.”

—Susan, California

Physical Contact

Shaking hands elicited one of the most decisive responses. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said no to handshaking, and many called the tradition “outdated” and “gross” and hoped the pandemic would hasten its demise. Hugging was the single largest divide among age groups: 65 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they would hug friends, compared with 36 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds, 27 percent of 45- to 54-year-olds, and 16 percent of 65- to 74-year-olds. About one-fifth of respondents said they were unsure about hugging a friend.

“I think I will really miss shaking hands, but it’s not always necessary and just seems like both an unnecessary risk and an easy way to protect someone else.”

—Sean, Ohio

“Shaking hands, screw it, dumb tradition. Just hit ‘em with the curtsy before they can offer and see what they do. Or, if you’re truly second level, give them the extended-hand ‘psyche’ and hair brush-back. Frankly, that should be the new normal.”

—Russell, Kentucky

“I’m unsure about shaking hands, as I had a [tradesman] come over who held out his hand, and I shook it before I thought about it. Habit? I felt rude not doing it, though I would have preferred not to.”

—Annmarie, Texas

“I’m fine with never shaking hands again, but damn, I don’t think I can live without hugs.”

—Emily, Washington

“I desperately need a hug. I’m grieving the loss of my husband and dealing with my mom’s severe illness. I’m willing to risk a hug with a close friend if they are willing to risk it with me.”

—Lori, California

“I want so very much to hug and kiss my 90-year-old mom, but I would never forgive myself if she became sick.”

—Heidi, Washington

“Hug a friend—I don’t care if it’s risky. I know it is. But I love my friends, and I miss them, and want to hug them.”

The military has the authority to treat troops with drugs approved for other conditions or with newly developed drugs, which presents a legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

Infectious disease has always been one of the military's greatest threats. By its own estimates, the US Army lost almost as many soldiers from the 1918 flu as died on the battlefields of the first World War.

Troops are at risk during an outbreak due to the tight quarters in which they live and work. It is therefore not surprising that all branches of the service — Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard — have been hit hard by COVID-19.

The military has also played an important role in responding to the virus, from evacuating State Department officials from Wuhan in January to its current role building and staffing civilian field hospitals and augmenting civilian research teams.

To mitigate any risk, the Department of Defense has enforced rigorous social distancing policies and a military-wide travel ban halting nonessential deployments.

New treatments

But in addition to measures aimed at keeping people away from sources of infection, the military is also treating active-duty personnel who become infected. Because the COVID-19 virus is new, there are as yet no FDA approved treatments.

As a result, military physicians are turning to either treatments approved for other conditions or seeking access to newly developed treatments, such as the antiviral Remdesivir, which to date has received FDA emergency use approval only for COVID-19 patients with severe conditions. That presents a significant legal challenge due to existing laws protecting military personnel by recognizing that their obligation to follow orders reduces their ability to provide informed consent.

As an expert in public health law and human subject research, I study the tension between protecting participants of biomedical research and responding quickly to emerging threats. But I have also had personal experience with the events that led to the passing of the law that allows the military to work with the FDA in order to get emergency authorization to respond quickly to emerging threats.

Gulf War syndrome

In 1998, I was working for now US Senator, then Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal when I met Russ Dingle and Thomas ""Buzz"" Rempfer, two remarkable airmen who filed a whistleblower complaint seeking protection from what they described as forced participation in an unlawful research experiment.

Specifically, they asserted that the Department of Defense was mandating that all active duty personnel be vaccinated against anthrax using a product, AVA, not yet approved by the FDA for the purpose the Army was now using it.

The vaccine had been in use since the 1970s to protect wool workers and veterinarians at risk from touching naturally occurring anthrax spores, but had not been approved for protection against inhaling them, a method of spread reportedly developed by Iraqi scientists as a bioweapon.

But many in the military were reluctant to be vaccinated because of their concern that it might be a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. To this day, there is no agreement about the specific symptoms, let alone cause, of Gulf War Syndrome.

A 2000 report by the well-respected Institute of Medicine found ""no conclusive link to the vaccine."" But the causal connection seemed plausible to many sufferers, especially given the continuing emergence of long-term harm suffered by veterans of the Vietnam War and their children from exposure to Agent Orange.

The whistleblower's primary claim was that the anthrax vaccination program was ""research"" and therefore the army was required to abide by two different protections. The first, called the Common Rule, is a law establishing that all research conducted by the federal government require the informed consent of participants.

Their second claim was that even if it was being used as a preventative measure, the Department of Defense was constrained by a 1998 law passed in direct response to concerns over possible links between unapproved drugs and Gulf War Syndrome. It prohibited ""the administration of investigational new drugs, or drugs unapproved for their intended use, to service members without their informed consent"" unless consent was waived by the president.

Blumenthal wrote to the secretary of defense warning him that administering an unapproved vaccine risked violating both laws and demanding that the research be stopped. That letter became part of a larger debate over whether the military's need for force protection exceeded the risks to any individual serviceperson.

Emergency use

In 2003, Col. Rempfer and six other at first unnamed plaintiffs brought suit in federal court which resulted in a preliminary injunction halting the vaccine program.

Responding to the lawsuit, the Department of Defense denied that they were conducting research and claimed the authority to waive consent because it was necessary to prevent infection with weaponized anthrax.

But in winning the battle, those seeking to stop the vaccine program lost the war. The Department of Defense appealed to Congress for a workaround. It resulted in the passing of the BioShield Act in 2004, creating the Emergency Use Authorization.

This gave the FDA authority to recharacterize the status of a drug or vaccine from investigational to approved for emergency use. In December of 2005 it issued a ""final order concluding that [the Anthrax Vaccine] was the best available medical countermeasure to the potential military emergency.""

Although Col. Rempfer filed a lawsuit to protest the FDA's decision, it was to no avail, and shortly afterward the Department of Defense resumed the vaccine program. Col. Dingle died of cancer in 2008, but Col. Rempfer remained critical of the anthrax vaccine program and still actively advocates on behalf of past and future military personnel.

A compromise

Since the passage of the BioShield Act, Congress has continued to support the FDA's authority to make unapproved drugs available in response to new threats. In 2017, the Department of Defense sought power to unilaterally authorize use of unapproved drugs in battlefield situations.

In the face of FDA objections to this level of autonomy, Congress created a compromise measure memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding that allows the Department of Defense broad authority to declare the need for emergency use permission and request that the FDA ""take actions to expedite the development of a medical product."" But final authority to issue an emergency use order rests with the president.

It is because of the servicemen committed to the preservation of informed consent that troops today have early access to potential COVID-19 drugs and vaccines while still respecting their vulnerability as patients without the complete ability to give informed consent.

“Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible but probably absolutely necessary.”

He added, “And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.”

Earlier this month, infamous left-wing billionaire George Soros discussed how the coronavirus will shape the world in an interview with Project Syndicate’s Gregor Peter Schmitz.

George Soros is giddy and excited these days, why? Because he sees the COVID-19 “plandemic” doing amazing things to destroy the economy, to destroy capitalism, and the weaken the United States to the breaking point so his army of low-information Liberal minions can swoop in and remake it.

You can watch the PLANDEMIC documentary below:

You will always hear Liberals saying things like ‘transforming America’, ‘changing America’, but you will never hear them talking about America’s greatness because they don’t believe it is.

Soros has been quiet in 2020, but his bank accounts have not, he continues to provide over 1 billion dollars per year to support radical and anarchist Leftist groups and causes.

Black Lives Matter? That’s Soros. ANTIFA? Yep, Soros. All those races riots from a few years back? Yep, that’s Soros too.

George Soros even funded Antichrist-in-training Emmanuel Macron when he ran for president in 2017.

Did you know? America Is Under Attack By 187 Groups Funded By George Soros

You can look for him to provide all the millions necessary for the Democrats to have their ‘mail-in ballot’ election in November, and even if people go to the polls, they are voting with a Soros-financed machine.

These are happy, happy days for Globalist Schwartz György, not since he sided with the Nazis as a teenager to rob his fellow Jewish neighbors and help send them to concentration camps has he been this happy.

Watch the video below, and listen as George Soros tells how that time in his life were some of his happiest moments. Until, that is, the COVID-19 Plannedemic.

George Soros Describes COVID-19 Pandemic As ‘Revolutionary Moment’ In Which ‘Everything Is Up For Grabs’

FROM ACTIVIST MOMMY: In the May 11th interview, Soros referred to the coronavirus ordeal as “the crisis of my lifetime” and gave his radical views for change and progress in the wake of the pandemic.

“Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible but probably absolutely necessary,” he said during the interview, adding,

“And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization.”

He went on to say,

“We will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started. That is pretty certain. But that is the only thing that is certain. Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve.”

Soros also discussed the “threats” now facing the European Union. Soros is a well-known supporter of the globalist organization. He asserted that “Europe is facing several existential dangers” and that he is “particularly concerned about the survival of the EU because it is an incomplete union.”

According to the Hungarian-born billionaire, the European Union was “in the process of being created,” but that process “was never completed.”

Soros contended that the EU is “exceptionally vulnerable – more vulnerable than the US not just because it is an incomplete union but also because it is based on the rule of law.”

During the interview, the progressive philanthropist also discussed a recent conflict between Germany and the EU that involved a ruling from Germany’s highest court on May 5 that one of the EU’s Court of Justice decisions regarding policies of the European Central Bank (ECB) was not legally binding.

This resulted in the European Court of Justice asserting that it alone had jurisdiction over the ECB.

George Soros, a globalist, sided with the EU during the interview. “When Germany joined the EU, it committed itself to abide by European law,” he argued.

He expressed fears that this ruling “poses a threat that could destroy the European Union as an institution based on the rule of law” as it could lead to other countries like Poland or Hungary to try to become more independent of the EU since “the German court can question the decisions of the European Court of Justice.”

Soros asked, “Can Hungary and Poland decide whether they follow European law or their own courts – whose legitimacy the EU has questioned? That question goes to the very heart of the EU, which is built on the rule of law. Poland has immediately risen to the occasion and asserted the supremacy of its government-controlled courts over European law. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán has already used the COVID-19 emergency and a captured parliament to appoint himself dictator,” Soros claimed.

Soros claims that Orbán has positioned himself as a dictator but a new poll shows that the majority of Hungarians (54 percent) approve of the Orbán administration’s measures and would vote for him in the coming election scheduled for this year. Orbán isn’t the only world leader Soros labeled as a dictator.

In the interview he briefly talked about President Donald Trump, accusing him of wanting “to be a dictator” but going on to say that “he cannot be one because there is a constitution in the United States that people still respect.”

George Soros remained vague in discussing the “things” President Trump allegedly wants to do but said the constitution “will prevent him from doing certain things” but that it isn’t stopping Trump from trying “because he is literally fighting for his life.”

He went on to add,

“I will also say that I have put my faith in Trump to destroy himself, and he has exceeded my wildest expectations.”

It’s safe to assume that Soros has labeled Trump as an aspiring dictator simply because POTUS presents opposition for the progressive, globalist agenda that Soros heavily finances and actively advocates for.

He has $5.1 million alone invested in a super PAC that is dedicated to funding groups working against the re-election of President Trump.

George Soros also notoriously finances left-wing causes throughout the United States and around the world to the tune of $1 billion each year including abortion, euthanasia, population control, transgenderism, and same-sex “marriage.”

If there ever was an arch-nemesis for conservatives, Soros would most definitely be it. (Read more)

The giant coronavirus stimulus legislation signed into law Friday provides federal money for the state to provide extra and extended unemployment benefits.

The Department of Employment Security has not yet revised its website to reflect how newly eligible people can apply for the new federally funded assistance, with state officials still working out the details.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a “deluge” of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.

Under the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an “emergency increase in unemployment compensation” of “an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. “

Tens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just “essential” businesses in operation.

The result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state’s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.

To handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.

Unemployment insurance (UI) basics

In normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.

The amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.

The new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn’t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.

Additionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.

Workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI

Illinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.

The state isn’t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they’ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.

Under emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.

Workers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI

Unlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers’ closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says “an individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.”

Parents who leave work due to a child’s school closure can get UI

With all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they “could be considered as unemployed through no fault of” their own.

You must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.

Anyone who’s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits

With the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.

“If you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,” IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.

Here’s how to apply for UI

You can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.

To accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:

People whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.

Last names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.

Saturdays are set aside for people who aren’t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.

People without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:",real

Dr. Andrew Kaufman may be the most censored doctor in the U.S. right now. His videos are removed and censored from YouTube very quickly.

Dr. Kaufman is so intelligent, and so articulate, that the “mainstream” media and medical authorities obviously fear him and his message, and they are doing everything in their power to suppress him.

This video (below) he did with Spiro Skouras, for example, was immediately removed from YouTube, although Spiro’s other videos remain for the most part (for now).

Andrew Kaufman is a medical doctor. Here is his full bio from his website:

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse. He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future. I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now. And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing. There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask. I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore. I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important. I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures. I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home. I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces. But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary. Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary. And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing. So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government. They already have permission because they have inalienable rights. It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

In early February, China's ruling Communist Party was facing one of its biggest political crises in more than three decades. A rapidly spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus was a ""massive risk and challenge"" to social stability, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top party officials in an internal speech that was later published publicly.

But with new domestic infections near zero, China has claimed victory over a virus that much of the world is still struggling to curtail. Newly confident and sensitive to criticisms that it initially covered up the outbreak, China's leadership is now seeking to recast the pandemic as a political win by arguing that its centralized, top-down governance system made it uniquely well-suited for containing and managing the virus; according to official figures, the virus has claimed fewer than 5,000 Chinese lives.

""The way the Chinese handled the coronavirus is coupled with technology, with culture and with very effective government coordination,"" said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. ""That's something unthinkable in Western countries.""

Emboldened, China has also taken a bellicose, sometimes-threatening approach to countries that are critical of its response to the coronavirus. China has pressured European Union officials to tone down or outright remove language describing disinformation that Beijing put out during the pandemic — a story The New York Times first reported. On Twitter, Chinese diplomats have lashed out at those criticizing China's handling of the pandemic.

China has been especially aggressive in countering a narrative pushed forth with no evidence by senior U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the virus originated — perhaps accidentally — in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease specialist, say the novel coronavirus probably developed in nature. ""The sole purpose for some U.S. politicians trying to fool others with their obvious lies is to shift the blame of their own incompetence,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said last month. China's state broadcaster recently released a satirical cartoon video depicting Lego characters representing China and the U.S., with America's Statue of Liberty making contradictory statements and throwing insults as China's mask-wearing terra cotta warrior patiently explains.

YouTube

""One of the most striking elements of Chinese diplomacy at this particular time is just how undiplomatic it's been,"" said Elizabeth Economy, Asia director at the Council on Foreign Relations.

When Australia joined the U.S. in demanding an investigation into the origins of the virus in China, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the Global Times state tabloid, likened Australia to ""chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off."" ""You do not know how aggressive, how unreasonable the West can be in making up their fictions,"" Hu told NPR.

A colorful provocateur who supports his country's more aggressive diplomacy, Hu justified China's more hawkish behavior as a natural response to American aggression. ""China is getting better and better, while the future success of the U.S. is not assured,"" said Hu. ""When the U.S. continually attacks China, mocks China, can you expect us to say nothing?""

While striking a more combative tone may have found support among its own more nationalistic citizenry, Beijing may not have expected the global backlash it is now encountering.

Faulty Chinese medical products, including face masks, have led some European countries to reject medical donations from China. Racism against thousands of Africans living in China's southern city of Guangzhou has wiped out much of the goodwill Beijing built up on the African continent. Several American lawmakers have argued that the U.S. should waive China's sovereign legal immunity; that would allow at least two states suing China for damages from the coronavirus to proceed to court.

China has shifted blame by accusing the U.S. military, without providing evidence, of first bringing the virus to Wuhan when it competed in sports games last October. The claim has gained traction on the mainland.

Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson known for his bellicose Twitter presence, has suggested several times that the coronavirus did not originate in China. State media outlets have repeatedly accused the U.S. of downplaying the severity of its outbreak.

""We think Americans came to the Wuhan seafood market in October when there were military sports games being held in Wuhan,"" said one former vendor at the Wuhan market where the first cluster of human coronavirus cases was reported.

Behind China's hostile rhetoric is a strong sense of aggrievement that other countries have overlooked its role in containing the coronavirus pandemic.

""People in China feel a sense of pride because they had to sacrifice and that the leadership in the [Chinese Communist] party led them in an effective way,"" said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who's now chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.

Others sense a more nefarious purpose behind the China bashing. ""The ultimate purpose behind fanning the flames for racial discrimination and assigning responsibility is to demonize China and suppress China's rise,"" wrote Lin Yueqin, a scholar at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in April.

Ultimately, what may be driving Chinese leaders' strident messaging is less a desire to impress other countries and more one to reassure its own citizens that China is standing up to American criticism.

""Either the Chinese diplomats are delusional, or they are simply doing their very best to prevent the international narrative from seeping into domestic Chinese discourse and undermining the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. And I would wager that the second is probably more likely than the first,"" said Economy, of the Council on Foreign Relations.

While assigning blame might score points with populist elements in both China and the U.S., it comes at a cost for an important geopolitical relationship.

""The epidemic at home was a real domestic crisis for the party leadership, and I think they've gone into overdrive to shore up domestic support,"" said Shirk, who is writing a book titled Overreach, about Chinese politics and diplomacy. ""But what's happened is they're overdoing it in a way that's causing this international backlash against them. So it's very counterproductive.""

Instead of collaborating on a global health crisis, the two countries are now even further apart, according to U.S.-China relations experts.

""The situation has decayed so much that to turn things around now and restore the level of international trust that China had previously enjoyed is all but impossible. It would be a challenge for even the most talented, cultivated and practiced diplomats,"" Zi Zhongyun, a widely respected scholar of U.S.-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in late April.

The voices of reason are increasingly being censored and silenced in China, leaving only those at the extremes of the political spectrum, Zi lamented.

""And as for the ignorant and the shameless online thugs,"" she wrote, ""well, they get a free pass.""",real

Updated on April 23 at 8:20 a.m. ET

A high-ranking federal scientist focused on vaccine development says he was removed from his post because of his ""insistence"" that the government spend funds on ""safe and scientifically vetted solutions"" to address the coronavirus crisis and not on ""drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.""

In a statement Wednesday that was released by his attorneys, Richard Bright specifically cited his pushback against unproven potential treatments that President Trump has repeatedly advocated for during White House briefings and on Twitter.

Bright was director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and a deputy assistant secretary with the Department of Health and Human Services until, he says, he was removed on Tuesday. Bright said he has been transferred to ""a more limited and less impactful position"" at the National Institutes of Health.

Asked about the removal during Wednesday evening's coronavirus briefing, Trump said he'd never heard of Bright. ""Maybe he was [removed after raising concerns], maybe he wasn't,"" Trump said. ""You'd have to hear the other side.""

In an emailed statement, Caitlin Oakley, an HHS spokeswoman, said: ""As it relates to chloroquine, it was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on COVID-19 patients.""

Bright said his career in vaccine development has prepared him for a crisis like this one. ""To this point, I have led the government's efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with HHS political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early in vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections.""

He added: ""Specifically, and contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.""

The president suggested last month on Twitter that taking a combination of hydroxychloroquine — which is used to treat lupus and to prevent malaria — and azithromycin could be ""one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.""

He has also repeated a line about patients suffering from the coronavirus who are inquiring about taking hydroxychloroquine: ""What do you have to lose?""

As NPR reported Tuesday, a panel of experts convened by the NIH recommended against doctors using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19, because of potential toxicities.

As for using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alone, the panel said there was ""insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against.""

In fact, Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the NIH and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, said last month that hydroxychloroquine was not considered a treatment for the coronavirus.

Bright said in his statement that he is ""speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science – not politics or cronyism – has to lead the way."" He said he will request the HHS' inspector general to ""investigate the manner in which this Administration has politicized the work of BARDA and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections as well as efforts that lack scientific merit.""

Bright's attorneys, Debra Katz and Lisa Banks, added that they are seeking a stay of his termination. The attorneys have also represented several high-profile whistleblowers and #MeToo accusers, including Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.

The New York Times, which first reported Bright's statement, said he had led BARDA since 2016. The online health publication STAT first reported he was no longer leading the agency on Tuesday.",real
1655,502,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/29/21241197/remdesivir-gilead-sciences-coronavirus-covid-19-gilead,2020-04-29,"Remdesivir proves effective against coronavirus in major study: ‘We’ve got a drug that works,’ UIC researcher says","Promising results from a major study into an experimental drug used to treat the new coronavirus should give people a sense of relief that “we’ve got a drug that works,” a physician at University of Illinois at Chicago Health who participated in the study says.

“They’re really good results,” Dr. Richard Novak, chief of infectious disease at UIC, told the Sun-Times Wednesday of the drug made by Gilead Sciences, called remdesivir.

He added: “That’s great and should give some people a sense of relief who are concerned about getting sick.”

Remdesivir is the first drug to show such promising results against the virus, which has killed more than 218,000 people since it emerged late last year in China. Having a treatment could have a profound effect on the global pandemic, especially because health officials say any vaccine is likely a year or more away.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The study, run by the National Institutes of Health, tested remdesivir versus the usual care given in 1,063 hospitalized coronavirus patients around the world. At the White House, NIH’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said the drug reduced the time it takes patients to recover by 31% — 11 days on average versus 15 days for those just given usual care.

Can block virus

He also said there was a trend toward fewer deaths among those on remdesivir, and that full results would soon be published in a medical journal.

“What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Fauci said. “This will be the standard of care.”

A statement from the Food and Drug Administration says that the agency has been talking with California-based Gilead “regarding making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible, as appropriate.”

The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with the virus’s ability to copy its genetic material. In animal tests against SARS and MERS, diseases caused by similar coronaviruses, the drug helped prevent infection and reduced the severity of symptoms when given early enough in the course of illness. But it is not yet approved anywhere in the world for any use.

Only hospitalized patients can use

Because the drug is given through an IV, only patients who are hospitalized will be able to receive it for the time being, Novak said.

“It’s going to be challenging to give in an outpatient setting,” Novak said.

The drug will also continue to be tested with other drugs to see if a combination of treatments will produce more positive outcomes, he said.

“We’re not done yet. We still need to find more and better treatments,” Novak said.

A less encouraging picture came from partial results from a separate study testing remdesivir in severely ill patients in China, published Wednesday in the British medical journal Lancet. Treatment did not speed recovery in that study, which was stopped after only 237 of a planned 453 patients were enrolled.

2nd study shows improvements

Separately on Wednesday, Gilead announced partial results from its own ongoing study of the drug in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The company said of patients who were treated with remdesivir within five days of an onset of symptoms, 65% achieved clinical recovery and 60% were discharged.

However, the results are difficult to interpret because there is no comparison group of people getting usual care, so it’s impossible to know how much patients would have improved on their own.

Stroger Hospital, which is taking part in the trial, has seen results that are “similar and consistent” with the overall results released by Gilead so far, said Dr. Gregory Huhn, an infectious disease physician for Cook County Health and principal site investigator for the trial here.

Huhn, however, said it will take more than a single drug to beat back this novel coronavirus.

“We need multiple strategies to defeat COVID-19,” Huhn said. “I think this drug ... in combination with a future vaccine, [could] provide a multi-pronged attack on COVID-19. So, I really think that an effective therapeutic along with effective prevention is going to get us to the other side of this pandemic.”

Stroger is also taking part in a trial examining more moderate COVID-19 cases. No results have yet been announced from that second study, which does have a comparison group getting usual care. The company said no new safety problems emerged in that study, and that it would publish results in a medical journal soon.

Other drugs researched

In other treatment-related news this week, two studies gave updates on anti-inflammatory drugs that aim to tamp down the severe inflammation that often develops in later stages of severe COVID-19 and often proves fatal.

A French hospital consortium reported success with using Acetemra, a Roche drug sold for rheumatoid arthritis and some other conditions, in a study of 129 coronavirus patients where 65 got the drug and the rest, usual care. No details were released; doctors said they were preparing to publish results.

A similar drug, Kevzara, did not work as well at low doses in a study of severely ill coronavirus patients, its makers Sanofi and Regeneron said. They’re continuing to test it at higher doses in critically ill patients, though.

Social distancing still needed

Novak said that the success of treating patients with remdesivir doesn’t mean that its use will necessarily have a significant impact on the need to continue social distancing.

“People are still dying from COVID-19, even with treatment from remdesivir,” Novak said. “The biggest concern has been [sick patients] overwhelming our hospitals with the number of cases. This won’t change that. We still need to be reducing the number of new cases.”

1670,22,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/next-frontier-mitochondrial-medical-applications-2020/,2020-02-19,The Next Frontier of Mitochondrial Medical Applications (2020),"Becoming the world's most advanced and largest professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader is the vision of most biotech companies in the field of mitochondria and mitochondrial research, and preventive medicine.

Mitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine.

There is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care is largely restricted to negating the complications of these diseases or assisting prevention through prenatal testing, mitochondrial donation therapy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. As such, the limited options and lack of curative treatment options have created more opportunities and investments into individual therapy trials, focused on optimizing oxidative phosphorylation and improving antioxidant capacity. In essence, a combination of vitamins, including coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), thiamine and riboflavin in addition to other regenerative medicinal approaches in the telomeres, stem cell and senescent cells is recommended. As of February 2020, more than 250 trials are ongoing worldwide investigating potential therapeutic approaches.

Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MAB or MitoBioMed) is one such company conducting such trials and aims to fulfil this mission by forming a strong competitive team with our medical institutions and customers, as a long-term and trusted technology and capacity provider in the global mitochondrial /cell therapy industry. Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus. An East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course.

With the advent of an ageing society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to ageing and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

MAB also establishes a series of training and certification mechanisms for medical personnel (such as doctors) and cooperates with medical institutions and academic institutions around the world. This makes it a prime candidate for impact investing towards sustainability development, in alignment with the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Company along with other biotech companies in the field have developed many product lines, including mitochondrial activated stem cells (Mitocell), mitochondrial biologics (Mitobio), mitochondrial activated immune cells (MAKcell), mitochondrial function tests (Mitoscan), mitochondrial aesthetic medicine, mitochondrial cell bank(Mitobank), mitochondria activated herbal extracts (Dynamito), mitochondria activated health food (Mitofood), mitochondria activation culture medium(Stemoto), etc., Mitocell, Mitobio, and MAKcell are all ready for the next phase of clinical development. Other products are cooperatively sold in the fields of preventive health care, medical beauty, cell culture, detection and analysis. These products have proven safety and effectiveness in preliminary studies.

Furthermore, Mitochondria for stem cell therapy is another frontier for regenerative medicine. Stem cells are primitive and unspecialized cells, they are a type of cells that are not sufficiently differentiated and have the potential to regenerate various tissues and organs. In medicine, stem cells have long been considered to have potential for medical applications because of their strong potential for treating physical damage caused by disease, aging, genetic factors or trauma. In international research, mitochondria are an important factor affecting the quality of stem cells. By analyzing the function of mitochondria in stem cells as a way to identify the quality of cells, it provides a scientific way to identify cell quality. The company's research is to improve the quality and function of stem cells by screening and increasing mitochondrial function. Stem cells activated by mitochondria have better therapeutic effects. Our company's mitochondrial activated stem cells have also been proven to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Osteoarthritis, Multiple System Atrophy

Lastly, in addition to the aforementioned products in the market, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT) work to prevent transmitting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases from mother to the next generation. Such diseases vary in presentation and severity. The goal of MRT is to prevent the transmission of such diseases by creating an embryo with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from the intended mother and mtDNA from a woman with non-pathogenic mtDNA through modification of either an oocyte (egg) or zygote (fertilized egg). This will help alleviate common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, and heart problems, which in combination lead to an increase of morbidity and in some cases premature death. While research continues to be conducted, if effective, MRT could satisfy the desire of women seeking to have a genetically related child without the risk of passing on mtDNA disease.

In the US alone, mitochondrial diseases affect around 1 in 5,000 individuals. It is also estimated that 1,000-4,000 children are born with a mitochondrial disease every year Therefore, there is a direct need to focus on building a world class professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader, with a purpose in creating affordable healthcare and biotech leadership in preventative medicine. It also creates a space for the community of social impact investing to be more deeply involved in health and wellbeing.",fake
1674,736,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nih-cancelled-coronavirus-research-grant-60-minutes-2020-05-10/,2020-05-10,Why it matters that the NIH canceled a coronavirus research grant,"When 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley recently sought to report on the origin of the novel coronavirus sweeping the globe, producer Ashley Velie pointed him to Dr. Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist whose work in sampling and researching coronaviruses in wildlife has helped identify potentially dangerous emerging diseases in humans. It turns out Pelley had previously reported on Daszak and was familiar with his research into how coronaviruses—such as the one causing COVID-19—move from bats to humans.

But this time, Daszak's story took an unexpected turn. Shortly after Pelley finished interviewing him last month about COVID-19's origin, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) abruptly canceled a five-year, $3.7 million grant supporting his research. Pelley and Velie had a new story to report and returned to Daszak for a second interview.

Several U.S. officials, including Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, had raised suspicions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one of Daszak's key collaborators in China. When a reporter mischaracterized key details of the NIH grant during a White House press conference last month, President Trump said he would check if any U.S. funds had been granted to the Wuhan Institute, and if so, he said, they would immediately be terminated.

But the $3.7 million grant was not given to the Wuhan Institute. It had been awarded to Daszak's New York-based organization, EcoHealth Alliance. A week after President Trump said the funds would be terminated in China, the NIH took action against EcoHealth Alliance, giving the organization no reason for the grant's termination. Ending an NIH grant usually requires a full investigation and proof of an egregious action like scientific or financial fraud—neither of which applied to EcoHealth Alliance.

Fellow scientists have spoken out about the unsettling precedent the NIH set. ""This is cutting off your face to spite your nose,"" Gerald Keusch, a former director of NIH's Fogarty International Center, told Science. ""This is the worst kind of thing that political interference can cause in a democracy.""

Recognizing the ramifications of NIH's decision involves understanding of the scope of Daszak's work—and its impact on future coronavirus pandemics.

Pelley and 60 Minutes first met Daszak for a 2004 report. At the time, scientists were still trying to determine the origin of the coronavirus that had caused a global outbreak of SARS, and ecologists like Daszak were among the virus hunters on the case.

For this earlier report, Pelley traveled to Malaysia, where Daszak and a colleague were trying to find the source of another deadly virus, Nipah, which had killed 40 percent of the people it infected. The ecologists eventually traced the virus to bats, which ate the fruit from trees farmers had planted over their pigsties for shade. Pigs then ate bits of tainted fruit the bats had dropped near them.

But even as he was trying to figure out how Malaysian pig farmers had contracted Nipah, Daszak had his eye on future outbreaks.

""What worries me the most is that we are going to miss the next emerging disease,"" Daszak told Pelley at the time, ""that we're suddenly going to find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.""

From the archives: Hunting viruses

As part of his efforts to predict and prevent future pandemics, Daszak subsequently became president of EcoHealth Alliance, which researches where pandemics come from and how to stop them. Much of his work involves bats, which have become breeding grounds for deadly viruses.

As Daszak explained to 60 Minutes, no one knows for sure why bats are such adept hosts for disease, but one theory is that bats are the only mammal naturally capable of sustained flight. Flying, Daszak explains, burns a lot of oxygen and puts a lot of stress on bats' cells. As a result, their immune system kicks in.

""Bats can't live with that sort of immune response all the time, so they dampen down their immune response. That's been shown,"" Daszak said. ""And in dampening down their own immunity, they allow viruses to proliferate. So bats carry a higher amount of virus and a higher diversity of viruses than other mammals.""

Bats, Daszak and a team of international scientists discovered, were the origin of the 2003 SARS outbreak. While scientists do not yet know the origin species of COVID-19, the closest match has been found in a bat coronavirus in China's Yunnan province that shared 96 percent of its genetic material with the virus that's known to cause COVID-19.

As hunting for virus origins shows, partnerships with scientists around the world are key. Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance has worked for years with the Wuhan Institute, and together they've catalogued hundreds of bat viruses, including dozens of previously unknown coronaviruses. The antiviral medication Remdesivir, the only drug so far proven to help patients with COVID-19, was initially tested against the viruses Daszak and his team had discovered under previous funding from the NIH.

Daszak said EcoHealth Alliance had been spending about $100,000 a year collaborating with the Wuhan Institute.



""I can't just show up in China and say, 'Hi, I want to work on your viruses,'"" he said. ""I have to do this through the correct channels. So, what we do is we talk to NIH, and they approve the people we can work with in China. And that happened. And our collaboration with Wuhan was preapproved by NIH.""

Last year, the NIH reauthorized EcoHealth's five-year grant after independent scientists reviewed the application. According to Daszak, EcoHealth's grant received a high-priority score and was in the top three percent of grants the NIH reviewed last year.

The NIH would not tell 60 Minutes why EcoHealth Alliance's grant was canceled or whether anything like it had happened before.

Daszak says the consequence of NIH pulling the $3.7 million grant will be felt for years to come.

""It matters because number one, our work is used in developing vaccines and drugs to save American lives and the lives of people around the world. So that matters a lot,"" Daszak said. ""Number two, if we really want to know where viruses are going to emerge and cause the next pandemic, we need to have scientific collaborations like this. They're our only eyes and ears on the ground in countries that are very difficult, for political reasons, to work in.""

""We are the frontline of preventing the next pandemic,"" he said. ""And we need to get on with our job.""

Russia, however, started to build up its reserves long before the crisis emerged.

Russia has become a saviour of the global gold markets as the pandemic has spurred abnormally high demand for the precious metal while it has at the same time also crippled companies' ability to produce gold in the amounts requested by market players, the vice president of Russian gold industry giant Zolotoy Monetnyy Dom, Alexey Vyazovsky, says.

""When a pandemic or war emerges, gold is everyone's first choice to buy. But right now buying gold is problematic. Refineries where gold alloys are purified, mints where gold coins are minted, some banks and exchanges, all infrastructure, including even some mines are closed due to quarantine"", Vyazovsky says.

The gold expert explains that Russia mines some 300 tonnes of gold each year and has huge amounts of gold stashed in reserves - something that is now saving the market. Vyazovsky stresses that the Russian government has allowed companies to export gold, with the main flows of the precious metal now going to the two main European gold hubs - London and Switzerland - which were experiencing acute shortages of physical gold.

This situation turned out to be highly profitable for Russian gold companies, the expert notes.

""Gold prices are on the rise in Russia as it's traded in rubles. So now the gold-mining companies are getting incredible profits"", Vyazovsky says.

Russia has indeed been boosting its gold reserves for some time and started doing so long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. When Moscow started dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds, it also started buying the precious metal, supposedly as a replacement for its dollar-nominated assets. In 2019, Russia became the biggest gold buyer in the world, closely followed by China.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Fake ID papers used by Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler in an attempt to flee Germany in May 1945 have been donated to the Military Intelligence Museum in the UK town of Shefford, the BBC reports.

The documents, which were unearthed 75 years after Himmler’s death, have recently been handed over to the museum by the great niece of Lieutenant-Colonel Sidney Noakes, a lawyer who joined the UK Intelligence Corps in 1943.

The papers are expected to be put on display after the planned reopening of the museum, which was closed due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Himmler used the fake documents, which identified him as Sergeant Heinrich Hizinger, as he planned to hide out in northern Germany’s Harz Mountains following Adolf Hitler’s suicide and the subsequent unconditional surrender of the country in World War Two.

On 22 May 1945, Himmler and his two companions were arrested after an Allied patrol asked for their identity papers, which carried an official stamp used by SS members in a bid to flee Germany.

The three men were then sent to a detention camp, where Himmler revealed his real identity and was then reportedly given a “gentle interrogation” by the British security service MI5; shortly after, the SS head committed suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule.

Bill Steadman, curator of the Military Intelligence Museum, has meanwhile been cited by the Daily Mail as saying that “without this damning stamp on the document it is possible that Himmler may have been able to pass through the system unnoticed, and escape as did many other wanted Nazis”.

As one of the masterminds of the Holocaust, Himmler oversaw the implementation of the so-called “Final Solution”, a plan for the genocide of all European Jews.",fake

The U.S. is fast approaching a full 100,000 Coronavirus deaths, but this weekend, Trump went golfing at a course in northern Virginia that’s a part of his own company. During a recent appearance on MSNBC, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered a memorable takedown of the efforts from the president and his allies to distract Americans from the actual devastation at hand. Ahead of the November election, Trump seems desperate to rush into any kind of rhetoric except the reality of the situation.

As Schiff summarized on Twitter:

‘Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn’t want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement.’

The conspiracy theories from the president and his allies have been numerous at this point. Towards the beginning of the crisis, the president even claimed that concern about the virus was a “hoax” and suggested that coverage of the then-growing crisis was some kind of plot to make him look bad. That obviously was not true. More recently, the president’s team’s conspiracy theories have included the idea that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is some kind of untapped goldmine for Coronavirus treatment, but a new study reveals that among tens of thousands of Coronavirus cases, usage of the drug was linked with a higher death rate across the board.

Hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by President Trump, is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to analysis of 96,000 patients published in the Lancet. Hydroxychloroquine is unproven for fighting coronavirus. https://t.co/LpHS9CuEmL — MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 23, 2020

Most recently, Trump staged a spectacle at a White House press conference on Friday when he claimed that governors must allow churches and other houses of worship to reopen this weekend or else he would “override” them and reopen the churches himself. Trump has no authority to “override” governors, and besides, religious and political authorities around the country have already been collaborating on the development of safe reopening plans for houses of worship. Trump’s spectacle was for show.

Change the economy.,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

One might think that more than 84,000 U.S. deaths from the disease would have put life in perspective for adults involved in a kid’s game. One might think that money wouldn’t matter so much now to a bunch of millionaires and billionaires.

If one thinks that, one might be a complete idiot.

Baseball players are complaining about owners trying to pull a fast one on them with revenue splits as they negotiate to start the season, probably because the owners usually are trying to pull a fast one. And the owners surely are wondering why the players’ union is being a pain in the butt under such trying circumstances for the nation. Answer: The players’ union is always a pain in the butt.

With the country craving sports, the two sides are arguing over who gets what if and when the season starts in July, a plan the owners recently approved. The players are worried that the owners are using the pandemic to introduce a salary cap to the game, a non-starter for the union. The arguing might eventually give way to peace and an agreement, but it’s almost beside the point. While the virus was bringing the world to its knees, these rich knuckleheads were fighting over dollars.

I don’t believe Tampa Bay pitcher Blake Snell speaks for all baseball players, but his outlook is so outrageously self-centered that it’s a nice starting point for our discussion of sports and money, which are conjoined at the decimal point. Snell said in a recent video interview that he would not play for a reduced salary this season. He said he’s worried about his health, given the COVID-19 outbreak. He should be.

But for him to tie it to money is so … so … baseball.

“Y’all gotta understand, man, for me to go, for me to take a pay cut is not happening, because the risk is through the roof,’’ said Snell, who was scheduled to make $7 million this season. “It’s a shorter season, less pay. I gotta get my money. I’m not playing unless I get mine, OK? And that’s just the way it is for me.

”Like, I’m sorry you guys think differently, but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I’m making is way lower. Why would I think about doing that? Like, you know, I’m just, I’m sorry.”

You want to talk about a bad look? You could have two noses and three eyes and still look better than this guy. Lest you believe Snell is a lone wolf, Phillies star Bryce Harper said: “Somebody’s gotta say it. At least he manned up and said it. Good for him.’’

Here are words to live by: If you’re looking for greed, big-time sports will never let you down. There’s something comforting about that. It’s nice to know that, in a constantly changing blur of a world, there’s something you can count on. You can also count on death.

I’m ashamed to admit that part of me thought there was no way in the world the two sides would get bogged down in money. Surely, I thought, everyone involved would realize how bad financial wrangling would look in this climate. What’s the word everyone uses now? Optics. Right. Arguing over money would be terrible optics.

Forgive me my naiveté.

There are still plenty of concerns over how baseball can return safely in this scary new world. Is it realistic to think that teams can hold the virus at bay while teammates are around each other daily and competing against other players? Is it possible to keep a clubhouse free of germs? Isn’t that like trying to tell a 3-year-old to stay out of the mud? What happens when someone tests positive for COVID-19? Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle was correct when he pointed out recently that the players union and Major League Baseball officials had skipped right past health and safety issues in favor of conversation about logistics. Read: money.

They can’t help themselves. They just can’t.

But they need to know there could be a price to pay if they allow their haggling to become protracted. They would be wise to remember how angry fans were after the 1994-95 strike and how that anger led to empty seats for several years.

Baseball fans want baseball back. That’s the prize. But they’d like it to be safe for everyone involved. And they’d like it without the greed that pervades professional sports.

The ventilators will be used to help treat COVID-19 patients and could help bolster the national supply of the medical devices, which have been in need during the pandemic.

“There was a lot of concern about the shortage of ventilators and we realized we had expertise already around the supply chain,” Park said to CNBC.

Fitbit plans to submit the designs for the ventilator to the FDA under an emergency use authorization

Fitbit plans to submit the designs for its ventilator to the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization “in the coming days,” according to CNBC. An emergency use authorization is exactly what it sounds like: it allows a medical device or product that hasn’t been officially approved by the FDA to be used to treat a life-threatening disease.

Park aims for the ventilators to be the “most advanced” emergency user ventilator available for a “lower” cost, but that a price hasn’t been determined, according to CNBC. Most ventilators cost thousands of dollars, and high-end ones can cost as much at $50,000. A Fitbit spokesperson declined to give more details to The Verge.

A number of organizations have contributed manufacturing resources to make ventilators. GM and Ford have offered manufacturing space to some ventilator companies to help them produce more units. NASA developed a ventilator designed specifically for COVID-19 patients; the ventilator received emergency use authorization on April 30th, meaning it can enter production. Phone accessory maker Belkin has developed a single-use emergency ventilator in partnership with the University of Illinois which is under review for an emergency use authorization.

The hires of sporting director Georg Heitz and coach Raphael Wicky were well-received, and the WGN-TV and Arlo White announcements were applauded. The work of the business staff was set to pay off with a record crowd as the Fire made their return to Soldier Field against Atlanta United, a franchise they hope to emulate

But that has been put on hold by COVID-19, which forced MLS to pause its season and postponed the Fire’s big day. Understandably, chief operating officer John Urban said there was some disappointment within the front-office staff when that news came down, though the overriding reaction has been a sense of resolve and optimism.

“When you ask about morale, the reality is that the success that was there and will be there, we’ll still have that day,” Urban told the Chicago Sun-Times. “It’s just going to come a little later than planned, but for right now we’re focused on the health and wellness of the entire Fire family and our fans and players and partners. We’ll get back to it, but that momentum is something that has stuck with everybody.”

Urban said the Fire were tracking toward 60,000 tickets sold for March 21, which would have been a sellout. Eventually, the Fire business side will welcome fans to Soldier Field for an opener, and they’re already considering the delicate balance of celebrating a big day while keeping the right tone in the wake of the pandemic.

Urban said the Fire want to “be a source of strength in these times.”

“We can be a source of enjoyment or diversion through some of the stories and connections that we have with fans and players and memories,” Urban said. “Not a day goes by that we don’t think about finding that right voice, finding our place in the citywide landscape and dialogue. It’s going to be an important thing. When we do come back, we’ve got to make sure we’re calibrated properly. It’s going to be key.”

That consideration also relates to how the front office is trying to maintain that momentum through what could be a lengthy break in the season. Urban said staying in touch with the fans thoughtfully and sensitively is a goal, and he’s proud of the Fire’s participation in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s “We Are Not Playing” campaign along with the city’s other major-league professional teams.

The unique situation also gives the Fire staff, which sources say hasn’t been furloughed or seen a pay cut, a chance to work in ways they otherwise wouldn’t.

“We’re working remotely here, every day we’re looking at opportunities, we’re looking at things that we can do to take advantage of some of the time that we now have to plan and to lean into some initiatives, both things that have arisen through the current situation, but also our business and the 2020 season generally,” Urban said. “The word momentum and the level of energy and commitment, we’re still working on it every day.

“If there are things we can do or ideas we can now explore because we have the luxury of a little bit of time, we’re taking advantage of all of that and being aware of the situation around us.”",real

In a new study, researchers created a model that uses a trio of biological markers to predict whether a patient was likely to die from COVID-19.

The model was able to forecast the death of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with at least 90% accuracy.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Doctors are struggling to identify which coronavirus patients will develop severe cases that require hospitalization and put them at risk of death.

Newly published research may offer a way to accurately predict a patient's risk of dying from COVID-19. The authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence created a model that looks at three biological markers — which can be measured in a drop of blood — that can indicate whether a patient's case might get dangerously severe more than 10 days ahead of time, with at least 90% accuracy.

Taken together, these three clues could ""play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention,"" the authors wrote, adding that their model ""provides a simple and intuitive clinical test to precisely and quickly quantify the risk of death.""

A trio of indicators that suggest a higher risk of death

In Wuhan, China, research shows 14%-19% of infected patients became severely sick. Among those critically ill cases, the death rate was higher than 60%.

To identify commonalities between these severe cases, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken repeatedly from 485 coronavirus patients at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 10 and February 18. They tested for myriad kidney, heart, and blood-clotting issues, noted whether those patients had survived or died, then used machine-learning algorithms to look for biological patterns.

The results found that the following indicators can predict whether a patient had a higher risk of death than other infected people:

High levels of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). This is associated with lung damage and the type of tissue breakdown that happens during pneumonia. Lymphopenia, the term for low levels of lymphocytes — white blood cells that defend the body against invading pathogens. An increase in high-sensitivity C-reactive proteins, or hs-CRP for short. This indicates inflammation in the lungs.

Using those indicators, the computer model could predict what happened to the hospital patients 10 days in advance of their clinical outcomes.

""The three key features, LDH, lymphocytes and hs-CRP, can be easily collected in any hospital,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""In crowded hospitals, and with shortages of medical resources, this simple model can help to quickly prioritize patients, especially during a pandemic when limited healthcare resources have to be allocated.""

A coronavirus 'risk score'

Another study published this week took a similar approach, pinpointing 10 biomarkers that can help doctors assess individual patients' risk levels. That research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, suggested using these markers to determine the likelihood that a hospitalized COVID-19 patient will become critically ill — admitted to an intensive-care unit or put on a ventilator — or die.

The researchers retrospectively examined medical records from 1,590 patients who were treated in 575 hospitals across China between November 21, 2019 and January 31.

Two of those biomarkers overlap with those suggested in the Nature study: high levels of LDH and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (which is associated with lower levels of lymphocytes).

The other eight risk predictors include a history of cancer, high number of preexisting medical conditions, older age, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, unconsciousness, abnormal chest X-rays, and high levels of bilirubin (a substance in the blood that, in elevated amounts, indicates liver damage).

The researchers used those 10 indicators to develop an online coronavirus risk ""calculator"" that could help predict which hospitalized COVID-19 patients will become critically ill.

That prediction tool could enable doctors and healthcare workers optimize hospital resources, the study authors wrote.

""If the patient's estimated risk for critical illness is low, the clinician may choose to monitor, whereas high-risk estimates might support aggressive treatment or admission to the ICU,"" they said.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

1754,1356,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-data-suggest-covid-19-may-not-be-deadly-thought/,2020-05-18,New Data Suggest COVID-19 May Not Be As Deadly As Thought,"With more antibody testing being done a recent study has found that there may be as many as 50-85% as many infections as there are known cases, based on their findings, this suggests that there could actually be a lower fatality rate and COVID-19 may not be as deadly as we once thought. This is not to say that it is not something to be concerned about, especially for those with pre-existing conditions, just that the fatality rates may be lower.

The shut down and lock downs of recent months have all been based on the premise that COVID-19 would kill more than 2 million Americans without taking some serious actions to slow down the spread of the virus, as we didn’t have any immunity to this novel disease. The model used at that time assumed the case fatality rates being at 1-3%, and at the time W.H.O estimated a case fatality rate of 3.4%.

Some experts are questioning these assumptions, arguing that without widespread accurate testing the known cases are likely to be only a very small portion of the true number of infections given the ease of spread, and thus high case fatality rate could be well off the mark by orders of magnitude. The truth is that we don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected and probably since cleared in the vast majority of the population due to lack of testing, the highly restrictive qualifications to get tested, and the potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection to this highly contagious virus running amok since January at an unknown rate.

As the weeks pass more data is being released supporting these views such as a recent preliminary study from researchers at Stanford which conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, California on April 3-4, 2020 studying a representative sampling of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood to show if they had previously been infected with COVID-19.

This study revealed that the Bay Area infections based on the antibody testing were 85 times higher than what had been reported, which is largely due to the lack of testing and asymptomatic carriers allowing the virus to spread unknown. The researchers suggest that their data may help to better estimate the true fatality rate of this virus; the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara among the 3,300 adults and children ranged from 2.49% to 4.16%.

“The most important implication of these findings is that the number of infections is much greater than the reported number of cases,” the researchers wrote, in a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study. “Our data imply that, by April 1 (three days prior to the end of our survey) between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in Santa Clara County. The reported number of confirmed positive cases in the county on April 1 was 956, 50-85-fold lower than the number of infections predicted by this study.”

“Many estimates of fatality rate use a ratio of deaths to lagged cases (because of duration from case confirmation to death), with an infections-to-cases ratio in the 1-5 fold range as an estimate of under-ascertainment,” the researchers wrote. “Our study suggests that adjustments for under-ascertainment may need to be much higher.”

Detecting previously unreported cases of COVID-19 infections could lead to a better estimation of the fatality rate. This study was not without limitations, but after adjustments were made to take these into account the researchers suggest these results could be applied to other areas.

“While our study was limited to Santa Clara County, it demonstrates the feasibility of seroprevalence surveys of population samples now, and in the future, to inform our understanding of this pandemic’s progression, project estimates of community vulnerability, and monitor infection fatality rates in different populations over time,” the researchers said. “It is also an important tool for reducing uncertainty about the state of the epidemic, which may have important public benefits.”

“This probably aligns with what overall national exposure may be, on order of about 5 percent once we do wide serology,” tweeted Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, agreeing that these findings likely align with what the overall national exposure may look like. “Santa Clara was a hot spot and I would have expected exposure to be higher. Overall we’re probably diagnosing 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 infections.”

Gottlieb also suggests that other hot zones such as New York that have reported over 223,000 cases of infection have data “to suggest the infection rate may be much higher.”

“We’re also likely to find higher rates of infection among certain jobs,” he tweeted. “But the data so far suggest that nationally, total exposure is still low.”

As several states begin to cautiously reopen there has been an increased push for antibody testing which, if accurate, may be able to reveal who already had the virus who may not have been tested for it. Antibody testing can be conducted via blood but can also be done using saliva looking to detect IgM and IgG antibodies that can take up to 14 days to develop.

“Those who test positive for immunity, in theory, are safe to return to work but it is to be very cautioned against doing so considering medical professionals are still learning about this virus,” said Dr. Robert Segal. “The human race has not developed an immunity to this virus, there is a possibility that re-infections could occur. We cannot be certain of that at this time.”

Accuracy of these rushed to market tests have however been called into question. As with any test accuracy is always a concern, and many of these rushed serology tests have yet to be approved by the FDA.

John Brownstein an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital said that there is growing recognition in the field that the numbers of those infected are far greater than the official numbers, and ultimately he says about this study that, “It adds to growing body of work that suggests a huge amount of cases that went undetected.”",fake
1758,241,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/diy-face-masks/,2020-04-06,DIY Face Masks,"After weeks of saying that face masks aren’t needed for the general public, the CDC as well as others are now recommending that the general public wear face masks, in fact the Surgeon General has even offered instructions on how to make some at home given that supplies are long sold out and near impossible to find. ( links to videos at bottom of article)

“CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

Some suggest that using blue shop towels as insert filters to make DIY face masks can improve filtering particles 2-3 times better than cotton after three clothing designers tested dozens of fabrics. The masks that are currently circulating the internet really are not geared towards professional, industrial production, but this is a case of something being better than nothing. Even the CDC has told healthcare workers unable to obtain proper PPE to use a bandanna or a scarf as a last resort.

This recommendation to medical professionals may be alarming as there is no evidence of homemade masks protecting against the virus. ""While wearing a scarf or bandana might help prevent a sick person from transmitting coronavirus infection to others by trapping respiratory droplets, it is unsafe for healthcare workers to rely on scarves and bandanas to protect themselves against infection by their patients,"" says Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at New York University.

In the recommendation even the CDC acknowledges that homemade PPE for the face still is not considered to be PPE noting that ""their capability to protect [healthcare professionals] is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option,” and adds that ideally a full face shield should be used in combination with homemade masks.

The National Nurses United professional association and union pushed back against the loosening of PPE standards against the CDC suggesting that surgical masks could be worn instead of the more specialized N95 masks: ""If nurses and health care workers aren't protected, that means patients and the public are not protected,"" NNU executive director Bonnie Castillo said in a press release. ""This is a major public health crisis of unknown proportions. Now is not the time to be weakening our standards and protections, or cutting corners. Now is the time we should be stepping up our efforts.""

Amid the shortages health organizations are partnering with private companies and donors to help make more crucial medical equipment available. Grounder suggests that such collaboration may be critical to bridging gaps in needed supplies during this trying time. ""We are at war against the coronavirus,"" she said. ""In prior wars, we asked families to donate their wedding rings, jewelry, and other items to the war effort. We should be pleading with the public and corporations who are hoarding respirator masks to donate their N95 masks to those serving on the frontlines of this war.""

For most homemade face masks are the only option. It has been suggested that by adding two blue shop towels to a face mask design that is tighter fitting homemade masks could block up to 95% of the particles tested, while cotton masks only blocked 20-60%. These masks are not meant to replace N95 masks, but as an alternative when proper PPE is not available.

Chloe Schempf, Lindsay Medoff and Heather Pavlu of Suay Sew Shop have dusted off their sewing machine and are making about 200,000 masks or as many as they can before they run out of supplies of these masks with blue shop towels they suggest are more effective to give to those people who are working in the front lines risking it all, as well as raising money to get them properly tested to see if their design can be validated as a safer solution to cotton during the mask shortage.

Not to contradict CDC recommendations for a cloth masks but, ""We spent a few days researching and brainstorming any material that could filter: coffee filters, batting, window shades, Swiffer, interfacing, etc., all the way to more technical materials that are available to specialized industrial sectors like aviation, oil refinery, medical fields,"" Schempf said.

They tested many materials to find materials that breath as easily as cotton but filtered better. HEPA bags for instance filter great but are too suffocating to wear(and they contain fiberglass). Inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask was found to bring the filtration capacity up to 93% of particles as small as 0.3 microns which is the smallest size their machines can test for; cotton masks alone filtered up to 60% in their best test, according to Schempf. They also suggest that the masks held the 95% filtration for 3 machine washes.

""This is by community, for community,"" Medoff said. ""This is ordinary people taking their power back.""

Health experts still say that masks such as these are not likely to protect a healthy person from getting the virus, but if those that are infected with the virus and are not aware of it happen to be wearing a homemade mask while following social distancing it could help to minimize the spread.

The Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, has even released a video showing people how to make their own cloth face covering in a few easy steps using an old T-shirt and rubber bands after the CDC announcement. Amid the shortage besides bandannas, scarves, towels, and bedding, people can make their own using items from around the house, he explains in the recently released video.

“Remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. And if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they're wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting coronavirus because they could have asymptomatic spread,” said Dr. Adams.

Here videos showing how to make a face mask, please note these are not to replace proper protective equipment, rather when nothing else is available:

The Dearborn Truck Plant, where Ford assembles the F-150 and Raptor pickups, halted production Wednesday after an employee there tested positive for the virus, Kelli Felker, Ford's global manufacturing and labor communications manager, said in a statement. Production is expected to resume Wednesday night.

""When a Dearborn Truck Plant employee who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately began to notify people known to have been in close contact with the infected individual and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,"" Felker said. ""We are deep cleaning and disinfecting the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.""

In Chicago, two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for the virus. The same protocols were applied in those cases, and Chicago Assembly now is running again. Due to the known incubation time of the virus, Ford said ""we know (these employees) did not contract COVID-19 while at work.""

The cases illustrate the potential perils of restarting production amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Michigan. Autoworkers employed by Detroit's automakers returned to work Monday following an eight-week shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At facilities operated by all three companies, employees must follow stringent health and safety protocols that are designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in plants. Those protocols include wearing personal protective equipment, having their temperatures checked before entering, and daily health self-certifications.

While COVID-19 testing is not available to the entire workforce of any of the automakers, all are making testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms of the virus or who believe they have been exposed to it. Ford, for example, has contracts with health systems in major metro areas where it operates. In southeast Michigan, the Blue Oval is partnering with Beaumont Health on testing.

General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Wednesday they have not been forced to stop production at their plants. Starting and stopping production is costly and something automakers would prefer to avoid — except for potential health and safety concerns.

Monday's resumption of production was the first time that the entire global automotive supply chain and major automakers all came back online at once, posing a major test to the industry. After a two-month shutdown in which the automakers bled billions of dollars, the goal has been to make the restart process as smooth as possible.

1767,891,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/officials-release-edited-coronavirus-reopening-guidance,2020-05-14,Officials release edited coronavirus reopening guidance,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Thursday released some of their long-delayed guidance that schools, businesses and other organizations can use as states reopen from coronavirus shutdowns.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted six one-page “decision tool” documents that use traffic signs and other graphics to tell organizations what they should consider before reopening.

The tools are for schools, workplaces, camps, childcare centers, mass transit systems, and bars and restaurants. The CDC originally also authored a document for churches and other religious facilities, but that wasn’t posted Thursday. The agency declined to say why.

Early versions of the documents included detailed information for churches wanting to restart in-person services, with suggestions including maintaining distance between parishioners and limiting the size of gatherings. The faith-related guidance was taken out after the White House raised concerns about the recommended restrictions, according to government emails obtained by the AP and a person inside the agency who didn’t have permission to talk with reporters and spoke on condition of anonymity.

On Thursday, a Trump administration official also speaking on condition of anonymity said there were concerns about the propriety of the government making specific dictates to places of worship.

President Donald Trump has championed religious freedom as a way to connect with conservative evangelical voters and has shown eagerness for in-person religious services to restart. He consulted interfaith leaders last month for suggestions on how to reopen and said on a recent Fox News town hall that “we have to get our people back to churches, and we’re going to start doing it soon.”

The CDC drafted the reopening guidance more than a month ago and it was initially shelved by the administration, The Associated Press reported last week.

The agency also had prepared even more extensive guidance — about 57 pages of it — that has not been posted.

That longer document, which the AP obtained, would give different organizations specifics about how to reopen while still limiting spread of the virus, including by spacing workers or students 6 feet apart and closing break rooms and cafeterias to limit gatherings. Many of the suggestions already appear on federal websites but they haven’t been presented as reopening advice.

Some health experts and politicians have been pushing for the CDC to release as much guidance as possible to help businesses and organizations decide how to proceed.

“They want to be able to tell their own employees the guidance of the federal government,” Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, said at a congressional hearing Wednesday. “They want to be able to tell their customers, ‘We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us.’”

The guidance relates to another document released by the Trump administration on April 17. That phased-in reopening plan broadly outlines how to move away from stay-at-home orders, school closures and other measures designed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus that has caused more than 1.3 million reported U.S. illnesses and more than 80,000 deaths.

U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, on Wednesday offered a resolution — blocked by Republicans — to encourage release of all the documents.

“America needs and must have the candid guidance of our best scientists unfiltered, unedited, uncensored by president Trump or his political minions. The CDC report on reopening the country is an important piece of that guidance,” Schumer said.

The decision tools have been undergoing review by different federal officials, and they’ve been edited from earlier versions.

For example, an earlier draft of the one-page document on camps obtained by the AP asked organizers if their program would limit attendance to people who live nearby. If the answer was no, the camp was advised not to reopen. That local attendance limitation was dropped and was not in the version posted Thursday.

And in that document and others, language has been dropped that asked if the organization is in a community that is still requiring significant disease mitigation. If the answer was yes, the organization was advised not to reopen.

Many of the changes provide more wiggle room than what was in the initial versions.

For example, in the document for people who run child care centers, the older version obtained by the AP stated that CDC recommended “checking for signs and symptoms of children and staff.” The new guidelines add “as feasible” to the end.

Similar new language about feasibility appears in sections about promoting healthy hygiene such as hand washing and employees wearing cloth masks.

1775,1826,https://www.pravdareport.com/news/science/144584-russian_scientists_vaccine/,2020-05-22,"Russian scientists test vector vaccine, report no side effects","Russian scientists test vector vaccine against COVID-19 on themselves

Employees of the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after N. F. Gamalei of the Ministry of Health of Russia tested their vector vaccine against COVID-19. The experiment was successful: immunity was confirmed, no negative effects were found, Alexander Gunzburg, the director of the center said.

""As for the developers, they tested it on themselves to protect themselves in the first place, so that they could continue developing the vaccine during the pandemic. Everyone involved in the development are protected accordingly,"" said Alexander Gunzburg.

Answering the question of whether there were any side effects, the academician replied:

""No. Everyone is alive, healthy and happy.""

He did not specify the number of colleagues who tested the vaccine on themselves, although, according to him, it goes about a wide circle of employees of the center - developers, organizers of preclinical studies and technologists.



The vaccine that the research center is developing is a promising vector vaccine based on the DNA of the adenovirus, in which the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus gene was integrated. The adenovirus is used as a ""container"" to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells, launch the synthesis of the coat proteins of the new coronavirus (the 'corona,' which earned the coronavirus its name) and thereby ""introduce"" the immune system to the potential enemy. Vaccines of this type are known as vector vaccines.



In mid-May, Alexander Gunzburg said that the vaccine was successfully tested on small animals - mice and guinea pigs. He also said that if the trials on primates, and then on volunteers, end successfully, the production of the vaccine against coronavirus in Russia may begin in August. However, it will be impossible to provide the vaccine to all citizens of the Russian Federation, the academician said. The vaccine will be delivered to doctors, law enforcement officers and social workers in the first place.

The daily increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Russia remains at about the same level for three consecutive days, while the number of deaths in one day was the largest for the entire period of the coronavirus situation in Russia.

For the time being, there are a total of 326,448 cases of coronavirus infection in the country. The growth rate makes up 2.8%, and the indicator shows a steady downward trend. As many as 8,894 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected in 84 regions, of which 42.2% did not have any clinical manifestations of the disease.



A total of 150 deaths were recorded in one day, which became a daily record for Russia. In total, 3,249 people have died from complications, while a total of 99,825 have recovered.",fake

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him.

The Grant Park Music Festival on Monday announced the cancellation of its 2020 season, originally set for June 10-Aug. 15 at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park and other locations across the Chicago area. More than 300,000 people attend the festival each year.

The free classical music festival, featuring the Grant Park Orchestra, under the direction of artistic director and principal conductor Carlos Kalmar, and the Grant Park Chorus, under the direction of Christopher Bell, has been a summertime tradition since 1935. Attracting world-renowned musicians and singers from across the country and around the world, the festival has continuously provided a diverse repertoire of classical music favorites and world premieres. In addition, the festival has been home to classic movie nights (featuring the orchestra providing live accompaniment to screenings of some of Hollywood’s greatest musicals) and Broadway show celebrations.

Among the festival’s canceled events are the annual Independence Day Salute extravaganza, all neighborhood parks programming, as well as master classes and open rehearsals.

“We’re still working to calculate the losses we will experience as a result of a summer without the Grant Park Music Festival,” said festival president and CEO Paul Winberg in statement. ”We hope our longstanding friends and donors will continue to maintain their support during this difficult time, helping the festival to return next summer stronger and more vibrant than ever.”

North American culture practically worships the pharmaceutical industry and often fails to recognize many of the issues within it. Many Americans are completely unaware that new prescription drugs have a 1 in 5 chance of causing serious reactions, even after being approved.

In fact, approximately 1.9 million people are hospitalized annually due to properly prescribed medication (not including any overdoses, self-prescriptions, or mis-prescribing). 128,000 people die every year in the U.S. from drugs prescribed to them, so why is this still happening? The reality is, drug companies make a lot of money from selling prescriptions, and they even pay doctors to do it for them.

If you’ve ever questioned this industry and your doctor’s motives, here is some good news: You can now find out how much your doctor is paid annually to prescribe any drug. In addition, you can also search any company name and find out how much they pay doctors in total every year.

The Database That’s Exposing Big Pharma’s Money Trail

The governmental website Open Payments Data

The two former options allow you to see how much doctors and hospitals are paid annually by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe drugs. If you search a specific company, on the other hand, you can see a detailed summary of their spendings. There’s specific information outlining which doctors are paid the highest amounts, how many doctors they pay nationwide, the nature of these payments, and then specific details of every single payment they made to doctors that year.

For example, when you type Big Pharma giant Gilead Science Inc. into the tool bar, you can see that the company spent $36,830,535.40 in Total General Payments and $45,394,349.76 in Total Research Payments in the year 2015 alone. 48.4% of payments were classified as “Compensation for services other than consulting, including serving as faculty or as a speaker at a venue other than a continuing education program.” The top paid physician made more than $600,000 in 2015 from simply prescribing drugs manufactured by Gilead Science Inc.

It doesn’t take much common sense to understand what this could mean, particularly since it’s hardly a secret that pharmaceutical companies essentially buy out the medical industry. Numerous pharmaceutical companies have paid doctors and researchers to understate the dangers of both drugs and their negative side effects, and to falsify research as well.

Arnold Relman, Harvard Professor and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, put it perfectly when he said, “The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. . . . The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.”

Don’t Be So Quick to Blame Your Doctor…

If you’ve visited Open Payments Data‘s platform and searched your doctor within their database, take a moment to reflect on what you’re really looking at. Just because your doctors receive payments from pharmaceutical companies doesn’t necessarily mean they’re terrible people; it could just mean that they’re doing their jobs.

It’s unlikely your personal doctor designed the current structure of the medical industry. Your doctor may not even understand the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry because MDs aren’t properly educated on these drugs. Many doctors genuinely believe they’re helping people through the use of medication; they don’t see the bigger picture here because it’s not included in their education. Plus, it’s often illegal for MDs to prescribe natural cures instead of pharmaceutical drugs and conventional treatments, particularly when it comes to the cancer industry (check out this CE article that exposes the truth about cancer).

In addition, when you actually think about it, it makes perfect sense that some doctors are being paid by pharmaceutical companies. Of course Big Pharma would require doctors’ help in creating drugs and validating their use; it’s completely legal and should be expected of them. However, there’s clearly a grey area here that cannot be ignored.

Pharmaceutical companies, rather than qualified and unbiased doctors, define a lot of the information that MDs are taught, and Big Pharma often influences medical professors and funds university programs. For example, 1,600 Harvard professors stated that they or a family member have ties to drug companies that could bias their teachings or research. The pharmaceutical industry donated more than $11.5 million to Harvard in 2008 for “research and continuing education classes.” Many Harvard students have expressed concern over this and it even made mainstream news when a student was belittled by his professor for asking about the side effects of a drug his professor was unlawfully promoting in class.

This has also been a prevalent issue within psychiatry. As Dr. Irwin Savodnik of UCLA explains, “The very vocabulary of psychiatry is now defined at all levels by the pharmaceutical industry.” This is partially because the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the text most psychiatrists in the U.S. refer to to diagnose and treat their patients, is heavily biased toward using pharmaceutical drugs instead of therapy. Read more about this in our CE article here.

If you haven’t yet been exposed to this side of the U.S. medical industry, I can understand that there may be some confusion. Why would pharmaceutical companies and some doctors conspire to over-prescribe or mis-prescribe people when their sole purpose should be to help their patients? The simple answer is profit.

The main reason we take so many drugs is that drug companies don t sell drugs, they sell lies about drugs. This is what makes drugs so different from anything else in life… Virtually everything we know about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our doctors… the reason patients trust their medicine is that they extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they prescribe. The patients don’t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very little about drugs that’ve been carefully concocted and dressed up by the drug industry… If you don t think the system is out of control, please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of death… If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new bacterium or a virus, or even one-hundredth of it, we would have done everything we could to get it under control. – Dr. Peter Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration (source)

Why Big Pharma Wants You To Take Pills

This may be obvious to many of you, but, just to be clear: The entire medical industry is focused around profit. It’s similar to any other industry in that every service it provides you with, or item it convinces you to purchase, makes someone else a lot of many. In the case of a pharmaceutical company, they can only make money if you’re sick.

So, it wouldn’t really be in the best interest of Big Pharma to sell drugs without any negative side effects. If they produced drugs that actually 100% cured people, how would they continue to profit off our illnesses?

This is precisely why Big Pharma does not get involved with all-natural medicines; there is no profit to be made in plants. Anyone can grow a plant with the right climate and it’s much cheaper to manufacture than synthetic drugs. It’s also easier to make pills in larger quantities than plants. and then when you consider the economies of scale, Big Pharma is able to generate an even greater profit.

Big Pharma has infiltrated pharmaceutical drugs into other industries too. If you eat animal products, then you’re inadvertently ingesting the hormones, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical drugs given to those animals. Antibiotics, birth control pills, painkillers, and other pharmaceutical drugs can be found in tap water as well.

Let’s take a moment to look at the bigger picture: Most industries are currently driven by money, not passion. It seems strange, but this is precisely the issue within the medical industry. I’m sure many doctors choose their occupation because they’re passionate about helping people. However, until Big Pharma stops playing such a crucial role in creating their job descriptions, it will be difficult for MDs to actually help people without simultaneously hurting them.

It’s clear that we need a systemic change in values. Until we start to work “for the people” rather than “for the profit,” we cannot expect these outcomes to change. It’s hardly surprising that Big Pharma wants you to be sick because they’re not just in the business to cure people — they also need to make a profit.",fake

Amazon Prime Air’s mechanical design and hardware teams adapted the design for the shields from the Washington State 3D Face Shield Hub, upgrading the shields to be more comfortable and the design more practical based on feedback from medical professionals. The new design, for instance, has fewer sharp corners that could snag on hair or clothing and a headband that reduces the amount of pressure on the user’s forehead.

The face shield design has been approved by the NIH

“When you think of Amazon you don’t naturally think of hardware design,” Amazon vice president of robotics Brad Porter wrote in the blog post. “But many teams across the company specialize in this discipline.” The company repurposed its manufacturing facilities, Porter wrote, converting a machine normally used to cut material for making drones into one that cuts screens for the face shields.

Sales of the face shields will be restricted to frontline workers at first, Amazon said, but the company expects to sell them “at a significantly lower price” than others on the market, Porter wrote. The design has been approved by the National Institutes of Health and should be for sale on Amazon soon, the company said.

Amazon also produced an open-sourced design package for both 3D printing and injection molding to allow anyone with the equipment to make their own shields. The company says it has donated 10,000 shields already.

Amazon did not respond to an email from The Verge asking whether it planned to provide the face shields to its own workers. Many of Amazon’s warehouse workers have complained that they haven’t been given enough personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their workplaces.",real

The spread of the coronavirus is dominating the news and has halted pretty much all of North American sports.

But talking about soccer — and sports in general — can be a pleasant and worthwhile distraction that allows fans to shift their minds to something more fun. That’s something Fire TV analyst Tony Meola is witnessing from his role on SiriusXM FC’s ‘‘Counter Attack.’’

‘‘Our talk on the radio is just hopefully to give people a couple of hours of an opportunity to listen to something, if they have the time, to get away from everything that you see on TV,’’ Meola told the Sun-Times. ‘‘There are still soccer stories there. People still want to know how teams are getting on and how they’re dealing with all of this.’’

In late March, the soccer chatter should be about the exploits of national teams as they prepare for their next tournaments or qualifying for a big event. European leagues are hitting their crescendos as spring approaches, and the season is just getting started in the United States.

But thanks to the coronavirus, news stories are different. The questions are about whether European leagues can award trophies and how those seasons can finish. In the United States, the Major League Soccer season has been paused and the Fire still are waiting to make their return to Soldier Field.

Of course, there aren’t any games to discuss and most news developments are related to the pandemic. ‘‘Counter Attack’’ is using the time without matches to look back at the first 25 years of MLS. And Meola, a U.S. soccer luminary who was the starting goalie in two World Cups, is grateful for the ability to talk soccer in this unprecedented and scary situation.

‘‘It’s definitely a nice diversion from what we’re doing personally here every day,’’ he said. ‘‘There are not many people that have the outlet to really enjoy very much. I love the game so much. I love knowing what’s going on in the world of soccer.’’

The games eventually will return, and Meola eventually will get back to talking about what’s happening on the field. He’ll be able to analyze how the Fire are doing under coach Raphael Wicky and whether all their new acquisitions are coming together in what is an incredibly important season for the franchise.

His voice, already known from his career in soccer broadcasting, eventually will feel more familiar on the Fire’s WGN-TV and ESPN+ broadcasts. Meola also will get back to working with frequent partner and Fire play-by-play announcer Tyler Terens, then with Arlo White when his schedule allows.

When that’s happening is unclear. Meola, however, is eager for the restart.

‘‘I can’t wait to call a live game,’’ Meola said. ‘‘I can’t wait to analyze a Champions League game on the radio. I can’t wait to get back in the booth and do a Fire game, an MLS game. That’s the most fun you have in this business. I’m looking forward to that day.’’",real
1790,834,https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2020/5/12/21251998/coronavirus-international-nurses-day-michelle-latona-mount-sinai-hospital,2020-05-12,"Nurses: Tough, tender pros who love their jobs","Michelle Latona is no hero. She’s a nurse, in the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.

Latona certainly doesn’t consider herself heroic.

“No, I don’t,” she said. “I wake up every morning and I come to work and do my job.”

A job that demands she tend to the sick and the dying for 12 hours at a stretch. To juggle patients, rooms, medicines, doses, equipment, colleagues, hours, breaks, all the time keeping focused on the central task: making people well again.

“We’ve been saving lives the entire time,” she said, admitting that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Chicago in mid-March, things have changed.

“This is a different time,” she said. “But I’ve continued to show up to work and do what I do.”

Latona never knows what’s coming through the door.

“This is a trauma center,” she said. “We still have gunshots, car accidents. Kids still fall off bunk beds. Now there are extra precautions. We have to go under the assumption that everyone is positive until they’ve proven negative. The COVID adds a little bit of extra stress.”

That “little bit of extra stress” has to be heroic, the modesty of the truly courageous, since most folks feel extra stress going to the supermarket, never mind having to intubate COVID-19 patients in an ongoing worldwide crisis hitting nursing much harder than most professions.

Nurses are the tip of the spear. The National Nurses Union reports at least 50 nurses have died in the United States from the coronavirus, and some 10,000 have been sickened by it. The only reason the death toll isn’t higher is because nurses tend to be younger, and fitter. Latona says her main hobby outside the hospital is working out.

She is one of almost 4 million registered nurses in the United States. Since Tuesday is International Nurses Day, it’s worth mentioning that there are 20 million nurses in the world, according to the World Health Organization.

If you haven’t heard of International Nurses Day, that isn’t because it’s new — the celebration began in 1965. It’s on May 12 because it’s the birthday of British nurse Florence Nightingale, who was in charge of nursing in military hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War. Like nurses ever since, she had to overcome hostile doctors, who at first would not allow the new female nurses in the hospital wards. And like today, Nightingale battled obstinate authorities to get desperately-needed equipment, which she often dug into her pocket to pay for. Nightingale shrugged off attempts to honor her after the war, taking the collection grateful Londoners had taken up for her benefit and using it to found a nursing school in 1860, the first in the world.

Asked what she likes most about nursing, Latona replied:

“Our team here, we have such a strong team. We’re like family. We’re showing up. We’re picking up extra shifts. We’re filling in holes where we need to. We’re helping each other so much.”

Pandemic hits home

Latona grew up in Bensenville, her father a Mexican immigrant. Before she worked at Mount Sinai, she worked at a clinic for underserved patients. “I just really enjoyed working with that population,” she said. “Low-income, uninsured, immigrants with no paperwork. I could relate. Just because they’re here doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be cared for.”

Her husband is a lawyer, and they have three young children: two boys, Theodore and Benjamin, 6 and 3, and a girl, Victoria, 22 months.

“My oldest always says, ‘Do you have to go to work?’ I say, ‘Yes, I have to go help sick people.’ He’s said, ‘Mom, I want to go to work to help sick people.’ He understands. All the kids understand when I come home, nobody can touch me until I take a shower.”

Latona feels safe, feels confident coming home to her husband and children.

“I do,” she said. “We feel comfortable. We’re taking the proper precautions. My kids are all really healthy, we have no preexisting conditions. My husband said, ‘Do you want to quarantine in a hotel?’ and I said, ‘Who knows how long I’ll be gone?’ ”

Victoria is named after her mother, “probably my best friend, probably the strongest person. I know.”

“She was a huge caregiver for my kids,” said Latona. Then her mother was diagnosed with COVID-19.

“She got sick back in March, right when this took off,” Latona said. “She was intubated, in the ICU for three weeks.”

Being a nurse, Latona knew what being intubated meant: About 90% of people who go on ventilators don’t survive.

“The worst part was, she was alone. I couldn’t go to the hospital with her,” Latona said. “She is in the ER by herself. She calls me and says, ‘They want to intubate me.’ I immediately started crying, because I knew what that meant. I hung up thinking, ‘Was that the last time I talked to my mother?’”

Latona had to care for everyone but the one person she most wanted to care for.

“It was definitely hard to come to work, seeing everything here; trying to focus, trying not to think of my mom,” said Latona. “I want to be present and care for my patient. Especially knowing what my mom is going through.”

Her mother is off the ventilator and recovering; in an odd way, her getting sick made her daughter an even better nurse.

“The fact my mom is by herself, it makes me more empathetic and understanding of the stress family members are feeling, the panic they are having,” Latona said. “Sometimes we’ll get phone calls from the family, and before you might feel, ‘We’re trying to do work!’ Now there is realization: They’re scared. I completely get it. The patient is scared. The family is scared they can’t be there, and they don’t know what’s going on.”

Second career

Latona wasn’t one of those girls who grew up bandaging her dolls and taking their temperature. Nursing wasn’t on her radar.

“It was actually a second career for me,” she said. She went to Illinois State, studied marketing, soon found herself wrangling the Shrek toys that went into McDonald’s Happy Meals.

“I was thinking: ‘What did I accomplish today?’ I felt very unfulfilled, not happy with it. I was thinking: ‘I want to do something to help people.’ I always liked science, and I always liked people. I was having a conversation with my mom, and she said, ‘I wish I had gone to nursing school.’ That got me thinking that’s the route I want to go. I went to nursing school.”

And what part of nursing is more fulfilling than marketing?

“All of it,” she replied. “In the emergency room you learn something new every day. You never feel stagnant. You ask, ‘What can I do?’ and there is always something to improve on, something to learn. The fun part of medicine is you’re never done learning what you can do better.

“We are such a family here. If you see somebody struggling, you go over to help them. ‘Give me something to do; what do you need?’ I never feel alone at my job.”

And COVID-19? Another chance for nurses to step up and shine.

“Even with everything going on personally, after all this started, I never called in [to take time off]. I felt I owed it to my work family to be here and help them.”

Five years into the profession, Latona has found her home.

“Something about nursing just called to me, and I’ve been very happy in that decision,” she said. “I don’t see myself doing anything else ever. You’re always learning something.”

Like Marines, like firefighters, there’s an annealed-in-flame quality to nursing. They’ve gone through the worst, together, which makes them strong, as a group and as individuals.

“It’s all pretty true,” she said. “We’re a tough group of people. We love our job. We see the worst of the worst. The ER is hard because we see somebody’s worst day, every day. We go from somebody passed away in that room, the worst day of that life, and we go in the next room, and that person is having the worst day of their life. That’s why our job is hard. It gets hard.”

Hard, though the job is not without benefits. The praise can be a little embarrassing. But the food is appreciated.

“We’re been very spoiled, lunch provided for us, really frequently,” she said. “We don’t think of ourselves as heroes. We’re just showing up doing our job. That said, we’re not going to say no to a nice lunch.”",real

Children in foster care may be vaccinated without a court order, against parental wishes, because vaccination is not considered a “serious medical treatment” that would justify High Court intervention, a three-judge appeals court panel ruled on Friday. Absent any “significant” or “unusual” reason a shot might not be in the child’s “best interests,” the London Borough of Tower Hamlets had full authority to arrange for a nine-month-old child in foster care to be vaccinated, the judges said in their decision.

The child was taken from his parents in September and placed into care after the government – which had previously removed children from the home due to the “parents’ chaotic lifestyle,” violence, and neglect – deemed his living conditions unsafe. While the parents had refused to have the child vaccinated, declaring the state should have no role in the raising of their son, they lost their initial case in February.

After an appeals hearing last month, the parents had already acquiesced to the state’s wishes, apparently seeing the writing on the wall and opting to allow their son to be vaccinated. However, the ruling is likely to have repercussions far beyond that case as the UK fast-tracks several Covid-19 vaccines to market.

Infant vaccinations are not mandatory in the UK, but the judges pointed out in their ruling that there was no precedent for a vaccination dispute being decided against inoculating the child and scientific opinion was largely settled in favor of the risks of not vaccinating outweighing any potential vaccine risks. Indeed, a 1989 law specifically categorizes the jabs as “preventative healthcare” rather than “medical treatment” and permits the state to arrange inoculations for children in care without consulting their parents. While parental wishes on immunization “must always be taken into account,” they can be put aside “unless the view has a real bearing on the child’s welfare,” the judges concluded.

The decision will likely have some parents up in arms, especially as the UK rushes various Covid-19 vaccines through trials despite a lackluster showing in clinical trials so far. Oxford University’s vaccine failed to prevent viral infection in any of the six rhesus monkeys that had been inoculated in its initial trial earlier this week, but the government dumped another £65.5 million ($80 million) into that project and human trials of the formulation will apparently continue despite the flop. On Thursday, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured orders for 400 million doses of the unproven Oxford jab, with plans to start delivering it as early as September.

Also on rt.com The more you know? Over a third of Americans apprehensive about Covid-19 vaccine, citing rushed development & trust issues

The UK has an especially poor history with vaccines being rushed to market – the government is still paying out reparations for citizens injured by the 2009 Pandemrix vaccine, which hit the market during a swine flu epidemic after just six months of safety testing. The shot left over 1,000 people, mostly children, with permanent brain damage.

No statements have been made yet as to whether the coronavirus vaccine will be mandatory, but a significant minority of respondents to polls in the US and France have balked at both the rushed development timetable – vaccines usually take upwards of 10 years to go through clinical trials and safety testing – and their respective governments’ politicization of the process.

In 2009-2010, more than a quarter of a million people fell victim to the swine flu – a previously unknown strain of influenza that might have infected up to 21% of the planet’s population.

As the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated worldwide, many people have discovered or re-watched movies that look strikingly similar to the 2020 real-world pandemic. In Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 film “Contagion”, several people – from an unfortunate family in the American Midwest to journalists, doctors and government officials – find themselves in the midst of the outbreak of a terrible disease that suddenly starts killing millions. Freelance journalist, portrayed by Jude Law, describes the situation:

“On day one there were two people, and then four, and then 16. In six months – it’s a billion. That’s where we’re heading”.

Sound familiar? But despite predicting in detail some aspects of the current coronavirus pandemic (you have to watch the very final moments of the film to see the most obvious clue), “Contagion” was based on the 2009 swine flu and the earlier 2002 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreaks. The film’s crew consulted a top-level virologist to make depictions of the pandemic look more realistic.

It is believed that the new H1N1 influenza strain originally “jumped” from pigs to humans in 2008. Even though some US officials believed that the virus surfaced in Asia and was brought to North America by a human carrier, later studies pointed to factory farms in Mexico as its place of origin.

The symptoms of the swine flu included fever, headache, dry cough, and a runny nose. Just like COVID-19, it was a big threat for those with underlying health complications, but unlike the coronavirus, which is known to be less dangerous to younger patients, the swine flu was much deadlier for small children and pregnant women. Its complications included pneumonia and respiratory failure, with the patients’ conditions often worsening significantly within three to five days and eventually killing them.

Doctors used a variety of treatments – from antiviral therapy to antibiotics – to treat the disease. But an effective vaccine was needed to completely thwart the pandemic.

Major pharmaceutical companies in several countries entered the race to produce and test a vaccine against the swine flu and by the end of 2009, it was commercially available.

One year after the outbreak started, the US Centres for Disease Control was encouraging people to get vaccinated. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases:

“Today I’m happy to say that we have a very good supply of the H1N1 vaccine all around the country. Many people have gotten the vaccine already, many more people want to get the vaccine, and we want people to get the vaccine”.

Just like the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1920, which neither originated in nor was the worst in Spain, the swine flu wasn’t a disease that was spreading from pigs to people on a regular basis. Despite its zoonotic origin – meaning that it passed the cross-species boundary from animals to humans, it was, just like other influenza types, spread through interpersonal contacts. At one point virologists even had to explain to people that eating pork does not put them in danger of becoming infected.

At the height of the swine flu pandemic, several countries, including China, Australia, Egypt, and Japan, imposed quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease by checking incoming travelers or locking down ships, hotels, and other facilities where outbreaks of the swine flu were detected. These measures, however, could not be compared to the scale and seriousness of the global coronavirus restrictions that have been seen around the world in 2020.

1793,87,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html,2020-03-17,Behind the Virus Report That Jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to Action,"
LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York.",real

2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet.

Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar protein cutting main protease enzymes in coronaviruses and the 3C protease in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication.

X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the enzyme’s active sites to interfere with their function. Test tube and petri dish testing identified one versatile inhibitor that blocked multiple coronaviruses and enteroviruses, as well as another molecule that showed strong activity against MERS-CoV with moderate activity against other viruses.

Due to the main proteases of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 being very similar the inhibitors will likely have good antiviral activity against the Wuhan coronavirus, according to the researchers. The next phase will be to test these inhibitors in animal models of disease before eventually moving onto human testing.",fake

Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Legoland and regional U.S. theme parks are expected to operate with social distancing-friendly attendance caps in place once they reopen following their extended coronavirus closures.

Post-COVID-19 theme park capacity limits will vary widely by state and change over time as each locale gets the coronavirus outbreak under control. But most parks are expected to reopen with limits of 25% to 75% of normal capacity.

But what does normal capacity mean? Is that the fire code limit for the park? A theoretical maximum capacity? Or the average daily attendance?

Florida’s Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force laid out preliminary plans for a phased reopening of theme parks in the Orlando area once the coronavirus crisis begins to wane. The Florida task force’s initial recommendations call for Disney World and Universal Orlando theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity in Phase 1 and at 75% in Phase 2.

SEE ALSO: Analysts say park closures could cost Disney $27 million daily

California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a four-stage plan for reopening the state economy that didn’t specifically mention theme parks and offered no details on what restrictions would be put in place when Disneyland, Universal and other parks eventually reopen their gates. No post-COVID-19 reopening dates have been set for Disney, Universal and SeaWorld parks in California.

The Shanghai Disneyland theme park in China reopened to visitors with advance reservations on May 11. Attendance was limited to 24,000 visitors — 30% of Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000 capacity. New Disney CEO Bob Chapek said actual attendance at Shanghai Disneyland would start “far below that” and increase by 5,000 visitors each week with the Chinese government’s permission.

SEE ALSO: First Florida theme parks set post-coronavirus reopening dates in June

Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000-visitor capacity is similar to Disneyland’s estimated capacity.

Disneyland’s capacity was approximately 75,000 visitors before the addition of Galaxy’s Edge and is approximately 85,000 when you include the new 14-acre Star Wars themed land, according to Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily theme park crowd sizes.

An attendance cap of 25% would bring Disneyland’s theoretical COVID-19 capacity down to 21,250 visitors. A 50% cap would work out to 42,500 Disneyland visitors.

“That’s why the phased ‘50% capacity’ guideline doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Touring Plans president Len Testa said by email. “That’s probably pretty close to how many people are in the park at peak time during an average day.”

Disneyland attracts an average of 51,000 visitors per day, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.

“But all of those people aren’t in the park at the same time,” Testa said.

Testa estimates 45,000 visitors are in Disneyland at any one time on an average day.

SEE ALSO: Which Six Flags parks will reopen first? These 6 are the top contenders

Disney California Adventure attracts an average of 27,000 daily visitors, according to TEA. Touring Plans estimates the capacity for DCA at about 50,000 visitors.

DCA could allow 12,500 visitors a day with a 25% attendance cap and 25,000 with a 50% cap, based on Touring Plans estimates.

The reality is that Disney theme parks rarely reach capacity. Disneyland occasionally halts visitors from entering when the park reaches capacity during the busy Christmas holiday season.

SEE ALSO: SeaWorld and Busch Gardens coasters could be delayed until 2021 due to coronavirus closures

The Walt Disney World resort in Florida attracts nearly a quarter million visitors per day, according to TEA. Disney World’s average daily attendance per TEA: Magic Kingdom (57,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (38,000), Epcot (34,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (31,000).

Much like their California counterparts, Disney’s four Florida theme parks have a theoretical attendance capacity far greater than their average daily attendance.

Disney World’s estimated attendance capacity according to Touring Plans: Magic Kingdom (90,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (60,000), Epcot (110,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (60,000).

Initial recommendations from the Florida task force call for Disney World’s four theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity before increasing to 75%.

Theoretical Disney World COVID-19 attendance caps based on Touring Plans capacity estimates:

Magic Kingdom: 45,000 (50%) and 67,500 (75%)

Disney’s Animal Kingdom: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

Epcot: 55,000 (50%) and 82,500 (75%)

Disney’s Hollywood Studios: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

SEE ALSO: Disney theme parks face $21 billion coronavirus loss through 2022, analysts warn

Calculating theme park capacity depends on two key factors: Open space and attraction capacity. A park like Disney’s Hollywood Studios might have room for 80,000 people, but only enough ride capacity to comfortably handle 60,000 visitors without wait times becoming excessive, Testa said.

“They don’t have enough rides or restaurants to support that level of attendance with reasonable waits,” Testa said via email. “So that’s what limits capacity.”

Disney officials, who declined to comment, rarely discuss visitor attendance or capacity.",real
1802,128,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/covid-19-stable-hours-days-surfaces/,2020-03-23,COVID-19 Stable For Hours To Days On Surfaces,"Recent research published in The New England Journal of Medicine has found that COVID-19 is stable for several hours to even days in aerosols and on surfaces; it was found detectable in aerosols for up to 3 hours, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to 2-3 days on both plastic and stainless steel surfaces.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA, and Princeton Universities have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can remain stable for long periods of time on surfaces and in aerosols. Their results may help to provide needed clues to the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, and suggests that people may be acquiring the virus through the air as well as after touching contaminated surfaces; this study has been shared widely after the researchers placed it on a preprint server to rapidly share their data with other colleagues.

The environmental effects of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov-1 which cause SARS were compared. SARS-CoV-1 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, and regarding stability both behave similarly, but this fails to explain when COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

This study mimics the virus after being deposited from an infected person to common everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting through coughing or touching objects, investigating how long the virus remains infectious on these surfaces. The scientists observed that the 2 viruses have similar viability, and that those infected may be spreading the virus without recognizing prior to displaying symptoms making control measures less effective. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces is likely what is contributing to the transmission of the virus in any setting.

Their findings confirm the guidance issued from public health professionals for people to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to help prevent the further spread of SARS-CoV-2: avoid close contact with those who appear to be sick; avoid touching food, eyes, nose and mouth until your hands have been washed with soap and water; use a tissue to cover when you cough or sneeze and dispose of it into the trash; be sure to wash your hands frequently along with cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces such as handles, door knobs, steering wheels, elevator buttons, ATM machines, store card terminals, stair railings, and counter tops among others.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Pooja Tewari: This is not how I thought I would end college.

Daniela Beck: My school where I'm from has really been impacted by the virus.

Emma O'Brien: We expected something to happen soon, but we didn't know it would be this drastic so quickly.

Masha Pescheryakova: When my chancellor first sent out an email telling us that UCSB's going remote, I was shocked.

Hasumi Tani: Students who were off campus during spring break were essentially told to not come back to campus, and they were ordered to either stay or go back to their permanent address.

Daniela Dwek: Last week was my last time in the facilities.

Belkis Anane: School is closed. Students were instructed to evacuate and join their families. But I cannot, because I'm an international student, and I cannot leave because of travel bans.

Hasumi: As an international student, I do not have a place to stay here, and, currently, I'm in a pretty sticky situation. My visa was rejected this week, so I literally do not have a place to go back right now. And my only choice is to stay here in America, and hopefully Georgetown.

Preet Kaur: I have chosen to stay in Santa Cruz. This is mainly because if I am exposed to the virus and I'm asymptomatic right now, I don't want to go back to my parents' house and accidentally expose my family.

Huma Manjra: When I came home yesterday, I had a lot of paranoia around, I really just sat through a flight, I really just went through two of the biggest airports, and who knows what I touched, and I had this fear that, OK, if I come home, am I gonna give anything to my parents, am I gonna give anything to my older, like, relatives, like my grandparents? Being here in LA County, where the cases are soaring, and doubling and tripling with each day, is really heightening my fear.

Genevieve Korn: I may not be able to see my parents for an extended period of time. Due to their age, they are in one of the at-risk categories, and I'm very afraid that the next time I look at my phone someone I know and love will be gone.

Belkis: Few of us are left here, but everyone I know and care about is halfway across the globe. So it is definitely very hard to go through this on your own. Housing is not a problem because I already live off campus, but I believe it is a great challenge to see all of my roommates and classmates leave and join their families while I cannot do that. It is very, very hard to be productive and work online when you are very worried for your family, who's in a very serious outbreak.

AJ Yablonsky: The whole university is now pass/fail, mandatory. You can't even opt in to take letter grade, because for people who are going home to family situations that they have to take care of a loved one who's sick with this illness or, you know, provide for their family because someone might have lost a job, they can't worry about their grades right now.

Genevieve: No one knows what's happening. But in terms of the professors and the universities, they're doing the best they can. They don't know how to cope just as much as we don't know how to cope.

Emma: It is, you know, really difficult to cater to all of the needs of students online, and I think a lot of classes will struggle. We really rely on the student to professor contact and relationship, and I just don't think that's really possible online.

Amona Saleh: Having our classes being moved to online has definitely lessened the quality of our education. Like, my science classes, all of our labs have been just canceled.

Emily Herrmann: What really stood out to me is just how radically unprepared the education system was for this switch. I know of some professors in the humanities who didn't even use email before all of this went down.

Genevieve: There are a lot of students out there that are really feeling lost right now and really need a friend. And they need someone to talk to because everything they knew was ripped away from them in a set of emails.

Preet: A lot of extracurriculars on campus have also been totally eliminated. I personally do research in a lab, and I am not allowed to go on campus currently unless I have things that I need to keep alive.

Emily: I'm an athlete on the track team. Our entire spring season got canceled, which has been really tough.

Genevieve: An organization that I'm the president of, all of our competitions were canceled, which I understand why for the safety of everyone, I agree with that they were canceled. I cried a lot when I found out that all of the work we had put in for months and months and months wasn't gonna happen this year.

Pooja: I am in my final semester of college, I was supposed to be abroad, had that taken away from me. I'm supposed to be graduating, walking in May, and there's a chance my commencement ceremony could get canceled.

AJ: Today actually we just got an email that our commencement ceremonies have been canceled. It feels surreal. Like, it's... I'm not even, like, sad. And I know I should be sad and disappointed, and I guess I am to an extent, but it doesn't feel real.

Huma: Just having to pick up, you know, leave everything, has been very, it's been a lot for me to process.

Emily: Not getting to say goodbye to friends in person has led to a lot of really emotional FaceTime calls and texting calls just thanking them for being a friend for four years. And I should have said stuff before coronavirus happened, and I'm learning that.

Elizabeth Camele: I go through periods where I feel very angry about the situation, and I also go through periods where I'm just in shock. Like, I can't believe this has happened.

Emma: So, a high moment of this experience is, you know, just the sense of community and love and support.

Daniela: Going on Facebook, different pages have been really uplifting with other students and new graduates being in the same position. And it's making me feel a lot better.

Katrina Jackson: They're just a nice dose of humor and a place for all the students that are more or less my age to come together in solidarity and just laugh about things and provide support if things are more serious.

Daniela: Like, we're all in this together, and the class of 2020 will be remembered, for sure, with all of this. And we will be celebrated one day or another, even if it's months after this pandemic.

Genevieve: It's terrible. I may not get to have a graduation ceremony. I may not get to see some of my friends again, but in the end it hopefully will be because lives were saved.",real

But how is it impacting at-risk children who are in the custody of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services? How has DCFS been handing the crisis?

Opinion

First, the good news. Overall, DCFS has been doing a good job handling this unprecedented situation. These are some of the positive steps DCFS has taken:

DCFS has given guidance to its private agency partners, and has done so in a transparent manner. Every directive and protocol related to COVID-19 is collected in a prominent location on DCFS’s website.

About 85% of DCFS’s operations are being conducted remotely. This includes remote interviews of children, foster parents and other care providers. Even operators at DCFS’s child abuse hotline are handling calls remotely, from their homes.

DCFS is giving foster parents $100 supplemental payments for March and April, for a total of $200, due to the additional costs of caring for children who are at home instead of in school.

A coalition of advocates urged DCFS to provide services to assist youth and young adults who have recently “aged out” of DCFS or are about to age out. These youth, many of whom have special needs, are particularly vulnerable for loss of wages, mental health issues and homelessness. DCFS is extending services to these youth including assistance with housing, food, unemployment, mental health and medical care and casework support.

DCFS was scheduled to rollout a problematic managed care plan for all medical care for the 17,000 children in its care, many of whom have complex medical needs, on April 1. The rollout in February for 19,000 children who were formerly in DCFS care — children who have been adopted or are in subsidized guardianship — was a disaster, with some 2,500 children being dropped from their health coverage for up to a week and many other problems. DCFS agreed to delay the managed care rollout indefinitely due to COVID-19.

Although there is good news in DCFS’s handling of the pandemic, there’s a lot to be worried about:

Calls to DCFS’s child abuse hotline dropped by more than 50% since the shelter-in-place order went into effect. Yet there is every reason to believe that incidents of child abuse and domestic violence are up with families hunkered down and isolated at home under stressors that are associated with increased incidents of abuse such as worries about work, money, and health.

DCFS’s move to remote interviews of children was necessary to protect children, families, foster parents, DCFS personnel and the public. But remote interviews, especially of young children about sensitive topics such as abuse and neglect, are not as effective as live interactions. It’s just not possible to pick up on all of the child’s subtle body language and facial expressions. It’s also more difficult to monitor whether someone in the next room is coaching the child.

Most concerning, all of the systemic problems plaguing DCFS for years haven’t gone into abeyance because of the crisis. As just one example, DCFS is managing the coronavirus crisis with the sever shortage of placements for children that existed before. As a result, children continue to languish needlessly in out-of-state placements, in what are supposed to be emergency short-term shelters, and in locked psychiatric hospitals long after they are ready to be discharged, just like before the crisis. Only now it is far more difficult to monitor these children.

Regarding children who are in out-of-state placements, even before sheltering-in-place measures and remote interviews, it was difficult if not impossible to properly monitor these children and the quality of the faraway placements. In addition, even before sheltering in place, it was difficult to support visits with siblings, parents, and other family members in these faraway placements.

Regarding children languishing in locked psychiatric hospitals for weeks and months after they are ready for discharge, in addition to being antithetical to the children’s civil rights, these children are needlessly in congregate care settings with shift staff coming and going and new patients coming and going. These children are thus at needless increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This is a result of DCFS’s dangerous shortage of placements, a problem that DCFS has known about for years and which has gotten much worse over the past five years, during which DCFS lost hundreds of placements.

While DCFS has been doing an admirable job during the crisis, DCFS is operating under the many and severe systemic problems that existed before. Most all organizations, under these unprecedented circumstances, are understandably not running on all cylinders. But if they started with eight fully-charged cylinders, there are hopefully redundancies if a cylinder goes out. Unfortunately, before the pandemic started, DCFS was chocking along on only a few cylinders.

Children, like other vulnerable populations, will be disproportionally impacted by this crisis. When the crisis is behind us, Illinois must commit to meaningful reform of DCFS. Children are our most important asset, and they deserve better.

1807,940,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/14/how-covid-19-exacerbated-americas-racial-health-disparities.html,2020-05-14,Racial health disparities already existed in America— the coronavirus just exacerbated them,"In April, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States' leading expert on infectious diseases, spoke in a press conference about the impact Covid-19 is having on communities of color, particularly African Americans. ""When all this is over — and as we've said, it will end — we will get over coronavirus, but there will still be health disparities, which we really do need to address in the African American community,"" he said in an April 7 press briefing. Those ""disparities"" Fauci mentioned are linked to early numbers that show African Americans are disproportionately dying from Covid-19. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the state's population, but account for 41% of coronavirus deaths, according to data released by Michigan's government. In Illinois, black people make up 14% of the population, but account for 32.5% of coronavirus deaths, according to the state's Department of Public Health. In Louisiana, where black people make up about 33% of the population, Gov. John Bel Edwards said in early April they account for more than 70% of the state's coronavirus deaths, with the majority of these fatalities taking place in New Orleans. And in New York City, black and Latino people are twice as likely to die from the virus than their white peers, according to data by the local government. All of these figures are based on the most recent data released to the public, with more states and local governments being pressured to share a racial breakdown of their numbers.

""There are definitely multiple reasons why we're seeing black communities be disproportionately impacted by Covid-19,"" New York-based physician Dr. Uche Blackstock tells CNBC Make It. She explains that when you look at the ""social determinants of health,"" such as where a person lives, works and the quality of health care they have access to, you will see that structural racism has left African Americans ""vulnerable and marginalized."" ""Even before this [pandemic], we had significant health inequities,"" she adds, while emphasizing the increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension, asthma and obesity in the black community. ""And what we're finding out is that these are the underlying medical conditions that result in very serious complications from Covid-19."" CNBC Make It spoke with Blackstock, along with five other black doctors, nurses and experts, to get their thoughts on how housing location, health-care access and distrust in the medical system have all contributed to the racial health disparities we see today.

Housing location and resources

Due to a history of housing discrimination and redlining, which is the systemic practice of refusing government resources to predominantly black neighborhoods because they've been deemed a financial risk, generations of African Americans have been forced to live in areas that lack access to healthy food options. Many of these neighborhoods, which researchers have categorized as ""food deserts"" are filled with fast food restaurants and small corner stores that have more junk food options than fresh fruits and vegetables. ""I think it's really important to understand that dietary choices aren't moral choices,"" says Chinara Tate, director of nutrition at Mount Sinai Eating and Weight Disorders Center of Excellence in New York. She explains that for many black and brown people living in poor communities, the food choices they make are made through a survival mindset, and they don't have the luxury of thinking about the long-term impact of their diet. ""If you have the option of purchasing an onion for a dollar or purchasing a meal for a dollar, it makes the most sense to purchase the meal, even if it's not the healthiest option because an onion is not going to feed your family."" As a result, residents in these communities tend to rely on high calorie foods that are cheaper and more accessible, says Dr. Jessie Marshall, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School. ""And we know that results in chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity,"" she says. ""So again, Covid-19 did not create these racial disparities that we are seeing. It simply magnified these disparities in unbelievable ways.""

Employment and health-care options

In 2017, 55.5% of African Americans had private health insurance, compared to 75.4% of white Americans, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That same year, 43.9% of African Americans relied on Medicaid or public health insurance and 9.9% were uninsured altogether. This disparity in health care is linked to the employment of African Americans who, along with Latinos and Hispanics, are overly represented in low-income roles that often lack insurance and benefits for hourly workers. Today, 63% of Latino or Hispanic workers and 54% of black workers earn low wages, compared to 40% of Asian American workers and 37% of white workers, according to a 2019 report by the Brookings Institution, which found that even in these low-wage roles, black and Hispanic workers earn less than white workers with the same education level and experience. Low wages, according to the study, are categorized as jobs that pay a median salary of $10.22 per hour or $17,950 per year. Some of these roles include grocery store clerks, home health aides, fast food workers and other service sector jobs that have been deemed ""essential"" during the coronavirus pandemic. Not only do these roles require workers to work outside the home, but many of them also offer no paid sick or family leave. ""Anyone who knows the history of America is not surprised,"" says Belinda Archibong, assistant professor of economics at Columbia University's Barnard College. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting employment discrimination, she says black Americans still face racial and gender barriers that keep them locked out of top jobs. In situations where black workers have been forced to hold positions with little to no benefits, she says she's watched first-hand how they have ignored long-standing health issues because of the cost. ""I've seen my own family go through the fact that when you don't have health insurance you basically avoid the doctor until it's like a life-or-death scenario,"" says Archibong. For many essential black and brown workers, she says it may be common for them to not even know they have underlying health conditions because they don't have insurance to visit a doctor regularly. Therefore, if they get Covid-19, and it's paired with untreated health conditions, their odds of beating the virus could be low.

1814,1732,https://www.infowars.com/poll-a-quarter-of-americans-are-not-interested-in-coronavirus-vaccine/,2020-05-22,Poll: A Quarter Of Americans Are Not Interested In Coronavirus Vaccine,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that a quarter of Americans are not interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

Trump also claimed that cutting off relations with China would save the United States some $500 billion.

Dr Paul Craig Roberts, an American economist who served as the United States assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy, has shared his views on the matter.

Sputnik: In a recent interview, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the percentage of GDP shrinkage in the second quarter is ""going to be very high"", even as much as 20 percent. How can the US sustain its economy during the crisis?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: All economies that had closedowns are experiencing shrinkages, even Sweden, a country that did not impose a mandatory closedown to the same extent. The Swedish people on their own closed the economy in an effort to protect themselves from infection. America’s economic problem is deeper and more long term than COVID-19.

American corporations offshored many manufacturing and professional skill jobs. These are high value-added, high productivity jobs that produced middle class incomes. These jobs were the ladders of upward mobility. When the jobs were sent abroad, the middle class underwent shrinkage and so did consumer disposable income or purchasing power, which lowered economic growth.

The movement abroad of jobs also reduced the state, local, and federal tax base. There was shrinkage in funding for state and local social services and infrastructure. Debt grew. To sustain aggregate demand, the Federal Reserve used an increase in consumer debt as a substitute for the missing growth in consumer income. This policy could work only until consumers were too indebted — mortgage, car, credit card, student loans — to be able to take on any more debt. Debt service used up consumer incomes, leaving little discretionary spending to drive the economy and leading to the current situation of ""debt deflation"".

Debt deflation is a situation of falling income and employment because debt service uses up the income left after meeting basic needs of food and housing. To correct this problem requires US corporations to bring the offshored jobs back home. That is, the solution requires the end of globalism.

Sputnik: The only economy that is now starting to recover is the Chinese economy. How great are the chances that China could overtake the US as the global economic leader? What would the reaction by the US administration be to this?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: In terms of purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is larger than the US economy. Unless China adopts the American practice of offshoring its manufacturing and professional skill jobs, China will continue to move further ahead of the US.

Sputnik: In the event we see further growth in the Chinese economy, shaking up American hegemony, how likely is it that we’ll see further pushback from the US towards China, such as going back to a trade war, imposing tariffs for example, or trying to pin the blame for the coronavirus on Beijing?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: The so-called ""trade war"" and tariffs imposed on imports from China are a misconception of the problem. The White House mistakenly sees the US trade deficit with China as the result of unfair Chinese trading practices. What the White House does not understand is that the ""Chinese imports"" are the products of US corporations, such as Apple, Nike, and Levi, that are produced abroad for sale in the US. When the US corporations bring their products to the US, they count as imports. So the fact is that it is the global US corporations, not China, that are responsible for the trade deficit. Instead of blaming China and worsening US-China relations, President Trump should be blaming US corporations.

Sputnik: There’s been an ongoing argument that the Chinese political and economic model is the key to “success” in containing the flow and aftermath of COVID-19. To what extent would you agree with this? Has the Chinese model indeed proven its viability, despite being sharply criticised around the world?

Dr Paul Craig Roberts: Economists and politicians do not understand what the ""Chinese Model"" is. It is more than a mixed economy of government and private companies developing according to a strategic plan. The most important part of the Chinese Model is the manufacturing capability, technology, and business know-how given to the Chinese by the US corporations that moved their production to China. A large part of the US economy was simply ripped out of the US and sent to China. This is the reason that China progressed so much more rapidly than anyone thought possible.

Sputnik: In your opinion, which countries have been able to contain the outbreak, both saving the lives of their citizens and protecting their economies? How might the global rating of economies be reshuffled in light of this?

The COVID-19 infection and mortality statistics are not very good, which makes comparisons unreliable. Generally, testing is not widespread and the tests are not always accurate. Moreover, deaths are counted differently. What does seem to be clear is that Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, did a better job of responding to the virus and controlling its spread.

The US and Europe were slow to respond and were unprepared despite knowing what was happening in China. Possibly also, the Chinese and Korean populations are more homogeneous and more cooperative with government than the disparate, multicultural populations that massive immigration has created in North America and Western Europe. These countries are essentially Towers of Babel, which impedes cooperation.

The U.S. Treasury Department offered amnesty to public companies that return money they borrowed by May 18, saying it would deem they made the application in good faith due to economic uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, before guidelines were clarified.

The country’s energy sector has been clamoring for government aid in the wake of plummeting oil prices that have driven several debt-laden exploration and production companies into bankruptcy.

While President Donald Trump said last month his administration would formulate a plan to help the oil and gas industry, no specific aid has been announced. This has left energy companies to seek relief under the broader $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package.

One aspect of the latter that has been used by oil and gas firms is the so-called Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, providing loans that can be forgiven to cover payroll expenses, as well as mortgage interest, rent and utility costs.

Denver-based exploration and production company PDC Energy Inc (PDCE.O), which has a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, said on May 8 it had returned its $10 million PPP loan.

Natural Gas Services Group (NGS.N) also returned its $4.6 million PPP loan. Its chief executive, Stephen Taylor, said the Midland, Texas-based compression equipment provider had to cut 20% of its workforce after it returned the funds.

Public companies and their employees were being “discriminated against” by a “politically driven process”, Taylor told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on May 7.

Dawson Geophysical Co (DWSN.O) returned its $6.4 million PPP loan last week, the company said in a May 14 filing. Midland-based Dawson, which produces seismic data for oil and gas firms, cited “an abundance of caution” and new guidance for the decision.

Among those receiving loans, but which had not disclosed whether they would return the funds as of Monday, included Calumet Specialty Products (CLMT.O). The Indianapolis-based refiner received $31.4 million through five PPP applications.

Exploration firms Amplify Energy Corp (AMPY.N) and Battalion Oil Corp BATL.A received $5.5 million and $2.2 million respectively. Houston-based onshore driller Independence Contract Drilling (ICD.N) gained a $10 million PPP loan.

The quartet, along with the other five listed oil and gas firms that received PPP loans, did not respond to requests for comment.

Energy companies have also benefited from emergency tax reform enacted in the wake of the pandemic.

More than $2 billion of benefits were recorded by a combined 43 companies due to two changes in the tax code, including one allowing current losses to be offset against past income tax bills, a Reuters review of first-quarter earnings statements found.",real

According to The Independent, the so-called ""Big Six"" English Premier League clubs, namely Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, are opposed to new broadcast plans that aim to give fans a closer look behind the scenes.

The Premier League’s powers have proposed conducting interviews at half-time, and filming team talks in a bid to drum up interest and to compensate for the lack of fan-generated atmosphere, should the division resume play behind closed doors in June.

The Big Six claim that this would add nothing to the ""viewing experience"" enjoyed by spectators, whilst undercutting their own private media channels, which are valuable sources of revenue in the absence of gate receipts.

Teams in England’s top flight have returned to training in the past few days, despite not yet reaching a consensus on issues such as whether to play the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season at neutral venues.

A vote on the matter was supposed to take place last week but was postponed as fears arose that the proposal could be rejected.

Numerous players, including Watford striker Troy Deeney, Tottenham Hotspur left-back Danny Rose, and former England right-back Glen Johnson, have also voiced criticism of plans for players to resume group training, arguing that not enough thought has been given to the player’s health and safety, on and off the pitch.

If the suggestion is ruled out, then it would be doubtful whether Premier League games could actually take place, as only a few options for concluding the campaign would remain viable.

These include rendering the season ""null and void"", calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League, and legal challenges are likely to be mounted if teams are either denied honours or forcibly demoted.

The Netherlands, France, Belgium and now Scotland have already decided to end their campaigns prematurely, whilst England, Spain, Italy and Germany are pressing ahead with plans to resume play behind closed doors.

The German Bundesliga is thus far the only league in Europe that has managed to restart, and only time will tell if the attempts made by England, Spain and Italy will prove successful.",fake

Updated at 4:36 p.m. ET

President Trump plans to appoint a council to advise him on how best to reopen America after much of the nation went dormant to help mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.

Trump said Friday that he plans to announce on Tuesday whom he has named to make recommendations about some kind of path to normalcy.

""I'm going to surround myself with the greatest minds,"" he said in another marathon news conference at the White House. ""We're going to make a decision, and hopefully, it's going to be the right decision.""

Trump and advisers must balance economic, social, public health and other priorities. The president was asked what metrics he would use in recommending when some places might begin to attempt to get back to normal.

""The metrics right here,"" Trump said, pointing to his temple.

Danger of a bounce-back epidemic

The president was asked about reports that have suggested that a return to normalcy after about 30 days of social distancing and other countermeasures might mean a boomerang flare-up in cases later this year.

Trump said he and advisers would contemplate the possibility of an echo spike after the current surge in cases and deaths slows.

""There's always going to be a risk where something can flare up,"" he said.

The president also acknowledged that if an echo outbreak gets desperate enough in some places, another round of social distancing and other mitigation efforts could be needed.

But the United States expects to add new tools to help it battle the coronavirus, including tests and treatments, so the model for a response will change over time.

And Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top immunologist who has been advising the White House's disaster response, suggested at a briefing on Thursday that normalization might look different for different parts of the country.

All the same, if the end has come into view, the nation still must travel a difficult course to reach it, another top physician, Dr. Deborah Birx, said at Friday's briefing.

She cited data about infections and deaths that are following expectations but are not yet on a downslope.

""As encouraging as they are, we have not reached the peak,"" Birx warned.

Trump: Response supplies flowing

Trump asserted on Friday that the federal response has helped mitigate earlier shortages in masks, equipment and other supplies sought for hospitals and health care workers.

""We're in great shape in every way,"" he said. ""Ventilators, protective clothing — we're not getting any calls from governors at this moment. We're getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything — we're in great shape for this surge that's coming in some areas.""

It wasn't immediately possible to assess whether, in fact, the shortfalls that have been reported in some places have been ameliorated; the president's statement followed weeks' worth of efforts to marshal, ship and produce the supplies.

Trump has, at various times, dueled with governors or other officials about the local needs or local responses to the crisis.

The president said he lamented that new predictions call for about 60,000 deaths from the pandemic but he said that outcome was preferable to the higher projections, including a range of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths.

""In the mist of grief and pain, we're seeing signs our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives,"" Trump said.

Trump and public health authorities urged Americans to continue to stay home, keep away from large groups and take the other precautions urged to slow the spread of the virus. The countermeasures are working, officials say.

Questions about process for normalization

With confidence now strengthened about the validity of the social distancing strategy and early indications about the end coming into sight, discussion has turned to how America may be able to get back to normal.

The White House's advisers suggest that there won't be one plan that applies everywhere.

""I don't think there are going to be benchmarks that are going to be consistent from one [area] to the other,"" Fauci said on Thursday.

Trump has been under pressure to at least announce an end date to the countermeasures, such as the call for staying home and avoiding large groups, which have amounted to a medically induced coma for much of the U.S. economy.

Restaurants, brick-and-mortar retailers, travel and other industries have been paralyzed; some 17 million people applied for unemployment benefits in the past few weeks.

With at least a theoretical decrease in sight to new infections and deaths, Trump and Vice President Pence say they're eager to begin assessing how sections of the United States could return to something like normal, permitting people to move more freely and return to work.

Trump said on Friday that's the assignment he'll give to the new council he plans to appoint, which he said would include ""great business, great doctors — we're going to have have a great group of people.""

That also could include governors, potentially even Democratic governors, Trump said at another point in the briefing in response to a question.

Long path to implementation

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR this week that his agency is working on a plan for normalization, but his comments suggested the necessity for a major and as-yet-incomplete effort.

First, the nation needs more coronavirus testing, Redfield said, especially testing with rapid results to render quicker diagnoses. Public health authorities also are looking ahead to new tests that can show whether a person had the virus in the past and may be carrying antibodies.

Second, Redfield said, the United States must vastly expand contact tracing to find people who are connected with those who become infected.

Loading...

Under those practices, public health authorities work from a person known to be sick through all the other people with whom she or he has had contact — to see how many of them might be infected.

Many people who get the coronavirus don't show any symptoms, but they still can transmit it to others who do become sick. That's why identifying everyone who has it, in whichever form, is so important to constraining the outbreak.

Redfield said an eventual national program to test and contact-trace would need to be executed by local health authorities, with the guidance and assistance of the CDC.

Presumably, once officials have a good sense about where and how the infection stands in, for example, a metropolitan area, they could then begin to decide when stores and business could reopen.

Attempt to negotiate oil deal

Trump also said on Friday that negotiations continue among oil-producing nations about a production cut in order to stabilize prices.

Global demand for energy has been in a tailspin as one consequence of social distancing — fewer Americans are driving to work, shipping goods, making deliveries and so forth. That hurts the oil industry, and Trump already has warned about layoffs in the energy sector in the United States.

Trump said on Friday that he had spoken with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about getting Mexico onboard with a global production cut.

Mexico is an oil producer but not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has a strong influence on production and prices — and which already has announced that it will pump less crude.

Trump suggested that the United States would ""help Mexico along"" with a cut to its own production that would enable Mexico to reduce its output by a smaller concomitant amount. Mexico would then ""reimburse"" the United States later for whatever accommodation Washington makes now on oil production, Trump said.

The president said he and López Obrador had agreed on that detail, but other oil-producing nations haven't yet signed on.

""We're working on it,"" Trump said. ""Eventually it's going to work out.""",real

In the UK, 248,818 people have tested positive for the virus, and 545 deaths were recorded on Tuesday, pushing the death toll to 35,341.

Here is your daily briefing of coronavirus news you may have missed overnight.

The 100-year-old Second World War veteran who raised millions for the NHS during lockdown is to be knighted.

NHS porters and cleaners and social care staff do not qualify for a Home Office scheme that grants families of health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if they die of coronavirus, it was revealed.

The GMB union said the exclusion of some of the NHS’s lowest paid workers was an “outrageous scandal”.

Around 8 per cent of social care home workers are non-EU migrants, who also make up a large number of those who work as hospital cleaners, porters, security guards and catering staff who are considered key workers but have been left out of the scheme.

Lola McEvoy, NHS organiser for the GMB union, called the policy “heartless” and said it leaves the lowest-paid key workers “out in the cold”.

“We ask them to take the maximum risk – but they get minimal reward. They have been drafted to the front of the fight on Covid-19 and if – as so many have – they lose their lives in doing so, their families are not looked after,” she said.

“It’s only right that they’re offered the same security and peace of mind as directly-employed NHS staff – after all they face the same dangers.”

An extra bank holiday to be put in place in October is reportedly being considered by the government as a way to help the tourism industry recover from the repercussions of coronavirus.

The UK’s tourism agency Visit Britain put forward the proposal for an extra day off near half-term, reported the BBC.

The government told the BBC it will ‘respond in due course” to the agency’s proposal, but warned that having an extra break does “come with economic costs”.

Head of Visit Britain, Patricia Yates, reportedly argued that an extra bank holiday in October would help the industry mitigate the benefits lost from the two bank holidays in May, as people remained in lockdown at the time.

UK Hospitality, a trade group for leisure businesses, also supported the idea of an extra bank holiday, but expressed caution.

Chief executive Kate Nicholls told the BBC: “A bank holiday in October may provide a welcome boost for hospitality businesses, not least at a time when consumer confidence will hopefully be returning to healthy levels.

“However, we are still some way from knowing what the sector will look like. A lot depends on whether businesses are able to open safely and whether the government continue to support businesses who need it.”

The University of Cambridge will hold all “face-to-face lectures” virtually until the next academic year, it has confirmed.

The university becomes the first to set out such measures for the full 2020/21 academic year and it says it is “likely” that social distancing will continue to be required.

However, it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it “conforms to social distancing requirements”.

A spokesman for the university said: “The University is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic.

“Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year.

“This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.”

An animal sanctuary in California chartered two planes in their latest mission to rescue 1,000 chickens from a farm in Iowa before they could be euthanised during the coronavirus pandemic.

But as global responses to the crisis reveal the efficacy of national-level strategies, it appears that such questions remain political and less based on scientific data.

Internationally-acclaimed author, journalist and academic Martin Jacques explained China's influence amid the ongoing crisis, namely relating to the country's handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as current and future relationships with major global powers such as the United States, Great Britain and the European Union.

Sputnik: You mentioned that you had spoken to one of China's leading intellectuals on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Can you explain how China tackled the crisis as well as public sentiment related to Beijing's handling of the outbreak?

Martin Jacques: What was striking was, due to the lockdowns across Wuhan and Hubei province, they managed to completely stop COVID-19 from spreading across China.

For example, in Beijing there were only eight deaths and seven in Shanghai. This was really remarkable when you compare it to the United States, where it spread into every state and clearly the measures taken were grossly inadequate.

Despite fumbling through the early stages, China took hold of the pandemic in mid-January and realised the scope of the threat. The measures they took suppressed the virus, and there is now a progressive but rapid opening up of the economy.

So far, there has been no spikes in new cases, with most coming from elsewhere such as foreigners and Chinese overseas students. Traffic jams have returned to big cities, evidencing a rapid economic restoration, and the mood has changed a lot.

— Martin Jacques (@martjacques) May 6, 2020

According to my friend, in January, there was a lot of criticism of the government for its handling of the epidemic, felt by a wide cross-section of people. But now the mood has reversed, firstly after China got on top of the crisis as effectively, or even more effectively, than other countries the manner I just described.

The other is watching the mess that many Western countries made of the situation, such as acting too late or failing to use the time China had given to prepare, in addition to using very variable strategies. The outstanding example being Germany and the worst Britain, with the United States being the worst globally. The mood is that now, people are feeling very good about China's response, in light of what might have happened, which is what the West has done, with a few exceptions.

Sputnik: A recent Lancet study evidenced the importance of contact tracing in stopping the spread of the pandemic in cities such as Wuhan and Shenzhen. Which measures did Chinese authorities take and how effective were they?

Martin Jacques: The first move they made was to stop people moving around using a major lockdown applied across all major Chinese cities. This was crucial to stopping the transmission, even amid the Chinese New Year, where millions of people move around the country, inevitably fomenting the spread of the disease.

Secondly, they took everyone's temperature. China has very good on-the-ground means of checking, inspecting and controlling, with residents at apartment blocks in cities receiving temperature checks before entering the premises, and if a COVID-19 infection was suspected, tests were immediately given. If results were positive, you were quarantined and contacts traced via an app designed by Tencent (WeChat).

The programme was rolled out on a nationwide basis, and even now, despite the virus being fundamentally under control, they still use an app system to monitor the situation, using three colours--red, green and amber.

Green means you're virus-free and can do the maximum of what's allowed, amber restricts some movements due to prior or suspected infections and red confirms a diagnosis and imposes a 14-day quarantine, with close monitoring of the population with contact tracing.

Efforts were also boosted by the fact people expect the government to intervene, stemming from Confucian traditions where people respect and look up to authorities with both looked at as one. This is in contrast to some nations, with extremes such as the US, where the government is widely viewed as a threat rather than a friend.

Sputnik: US president Donald Trump has continued the US trade war on China and launched a campaign against Beijing amid the pandemic, accusing the latter of leaking COVID-19 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and 'covering-up' the outbreak. Why specifically is he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doing this in the absence of support from international bodies, the scientific community and even the Pentagon?

Martin Jacques: You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know what he's up to here. America's COVID-19 response has been a disaster. He's been completely irresponsible and denied there was a problem and even talked about it being a hoax. He didn't think it would ever happen in the US and thought it was a 'Chinese problem'. As a result, the country flew blind.

Inevitably, the virus spread to the States in March and April, and I think that, to avoid the responsibility and embarrassment at home, tried to distract and deflect criticism by blaming China for the pandemic, firstly by calling it the 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' virus, as if viruses have borders or nationality.

He later claimed, despite overwhelming consensus from scientists, that the virus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I think it's nonsense, actually, and an attempt to cover up for presiding over a disaster across the US.

The origins and development of viruses are difficult to determine, and it's a job for scientists. French scientists stated that the first cases in France began in November or December, in line with China's cases, and Italy believes their cases originated in Germany around January or February, indicating it dates back further than most are talking about, possibly in a lesser, asymptomatic form or with milder symptoms, but became more aggressive after developing in Wuhan.

I read the other day that there were 14 variants of the disease, with the East Coast in the US having a more virulent strain than the West Coast.

So I think this is not about science, but about politics, and I'm concerned about what's emanating from the White House. The deterioration in relations between the US and China were at the behest of Washington, with a sharp departure from Sino-US relations underpinned since 1972, where China was to be regarded as a competitor, but is now seen as a threat.

In regards to COVID-19, the pandemic has moved to the centre of the argument, taking precedence over the US-China trade war. Trump mentioned on Thursday evening that COVID-19 was a greater threat to American life than Pearl Harbour or 9/11. He doesn't say that China is an enemy and is responsible, but accuses Beijing of failing to stop the disease.

This is very disturbing because it's poisoning the relationship with China. COVID-19 is going to be a key moment in history, namely in the last few decades, because of China's economic rise to power. But with COVID-19, the argument has shifted from a narrow question of economics to a question of governance, which the West has long regarded as its area of advantage. But the global response to the pandemic will shift the argument in favour of Beijing.

Sputnik: What do you believe is the future of Sino-British ties after the pandemic? How have relations change from previous administrations and will London follow Washington or follow an independent strategy?

Martin Jacques: During the [former Prime Minister] David Cameron and [Chancellor of the Excheqers] George Osborne government, Britain pursued a relatively cooperative and strong economic relationship. They welcomed Chinese investment, nuclear power, Huawei as an important investor, and an expanding range of cooperation.

Then, after the Cameron government fell and [Former Prime Minister] Theresa May was elected, the relationship didn't deteriorate, but went into a period of stagnation. Nothing was reversed but the growth in friendship was not resumed, either.

PM Boris Johnson has continued his predecessor's position, now with the important question of Huawei's 5G partnership, who was allowed 30 percent of the market. But there is a backlash mainly in the Conservative Party which wants to review Sino-UK ties, or even roll them back altogether or perceive China as a threat, obviously influenced by Trump's rise.

Relations have definitely cooled and suspicions deepened due to China growing stronger, moving from a fast-growing economy but not rivalling Western levels of technology, to China becoming a technological power and innovator, and sections of the UK have attempted to pigeonhole Beijing as a competitor or threat.

In the long run, this is a totally unsustainable position because Beijing is on the rise and the second-largest global economy, and is a leader in numerous technologies, and these ties will be essential.

It's not like in the former Soviet Union which was never strong in these areas save for the military, and China is and will continue to be a major economic success.

You can't just refuse to deal with a country like that, especially without ""cutting your nose to spite your face"". You may be able to do that to lesser countries not seen as competitors, but not to China, who has so much of the technology we are going to need.

Regarding COVID-19, a lot of essential supplies are made in China and no longer in the UK and other countries. So such a position is unsustainable in the long term, but in the short term could become more influential.

Europe has also been affected by the deterioration in Sino-US relations, and Europeans by and large don't follow or even like President Trump, but nevertheless feels challenged by China's rise and are concerned about how to 'defend' or 'protect' itself from Beijing, for example, the challenge the Belt and Road Initiative poses to the European Union.

I believe if we had the Cameron-Osborne approach to Sino-British ties, I may be more optimistic. But under the current position, I think they will worsen over a long time, namely in the context of COVID-19.

Many countries will go through a very painful period, much more than after the 2010 financial crisis, with a lot of dissatisfaction and people looking for someone to blame, who will blame Beijing in the Trump manner.

A recent poll revealed that roughly between two-thirds and three-fourths of the US population feel negative about China, pointing to a presidential election in November where Trump will play the anti-China card big time.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized in Moscow with a suspected coronavirus infection, Interfax reported Thursday.

Kadyrov, 43, was reportedly flown to the Russian capital Wednesday, a few days after reporting flu-like symptoms, the Baza Telegram channel reported earlier Thursday. Chechen doctors recommended that Kadyrov seek treatment there after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly,” Baza said.

The Telegram channel cited medical data as saying that Kadyrov has been diagnosed with lung damage and a suspected Covid-19 infection.

“He is under doctors’ supervision,” Interfax cited its source as saying.

A well-known transport tracker said Thursday that a private jet linked to Kadyrov arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport from the Chechen capital of Grozny.

Kadyrov’s official page on Russian social network Vkontakte has posted several updates in the past 24 hours, including posts on his charitable donations and birthday greetings for Russia’s defense minister, but has not yet addressed his alleged infection.

Kadyrov was last active on his Telegram account on Tuesday, while Instagram blocked his page last week.

A spokesperson for Indiana’s public health department pointed to this difference to explain the state’s test gap. But our analysis suggests this—or any other methodological factor—does not fully explain the widespread discrepancies. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told us that one possible explanation is that the CDC could be overreporting testing totals in some states if it is including antibody-test results, which don’t track real-time infections, and underreporting in other states because of delays in paperwork. But the differences seem to be so widespread that they are unlikely to arise from a single discrepancy in how certain kinds of tests are reported. At their current rate of growth, Florida’s state-reported testing numbers would not match the CDC’s current totals for another two weeks.

“This is more evidence of the dysfunction of the CDC,” Jha said. “There is not supposed to be a lot of daylight between the CDC and the states.” Jha has previously criticized the CDC for being “inexplicably absent” during the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the mismatch between states and the CDC could be explained by the federal government’s unusual manner of collecting testing data. Generally, disease-surveillance data flow from local public-health departments to state governments, and then on to the federal government. But in April, Vice President Mike Pence asked hospitals to start reporting their COVID-19 testing data directly to the federal government. In an email, a CDC spokesperson confirmed that the new website reflected test data from more sources than just states, saying it came from hospitals, private medical-testing companies, and state and local public-health labs.

Yascha Mounk: No testing, no treatment, no herd immunity, no easy way out

The data that Pence requested fed into a piece of software called HHS Protect, which was meant to serve as a clearinghouse of coronavirus data for the Trump administration, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS Protect was developed by the defense contractor Palantir. The company declined to comment on the record.

It’s unclear exactly when the CDC site first appeared. A CDC spokesperson told us that it went live on May 7, but the first Internet Archive cache of the page is dated May 9. The CDC did not announce the existence of the page in any statement, social-media post, or press conference.

In many of the counts the CDC did provide over the past several months, it missed the large majority of tests. In early May, the CDC reported that only about half a million tests had been conducted in the U.S. But the COVID Tracking Project had tallied the results of more than 7.5 million tests reported by states by then. In late April, the White House used the COVID Tracking Project’s data in a major report on national testing strategy. It cited the data again earlier this week in a press conference.

The CDC should provide the country with a single, trustworthy data source on the state of COVID-19 testing. But the fact that its data are still in such disagreement with the state-reported totals means that the CDC’s latest efforts are not of much use to politicians and the public. For now, the agency that should be a respected source of truth in this crisis is only adding to the national confusion.

He also warns that ""simply pumping trillions"" into the financial system won't deliver a recovery on its own.

According to the International Monetary Fund, even prior to the current global recession, the real GDP growth rate per capita had been subdued or declining, public investment had been declining and the growth of investment per capita in emerging markets had also been slow.

Michael Roberts has worked as an economist with investment research firms in the City of London for over 30 years. He explains that the COVID-19 lockdowns represented the ""tipping point"" for a global economy which was already headed towards recession.

Sputnik: Jay Powell, Chair of the US Federal Reserve Bank, recently said that the current economic crisis is completely due to COVID-19 and the lockdown policies and not due to any underlying problems in the economy.

How would you respond to Powell's remarks?

Michael Roberts: Just as they did during the global financial crash in 2008-9, the monetary authorities do not want to admit that the current crisis has its origins in fault lines in the major economies. Only last September [2019], the fed was forced to inject billions in emergency liquidity when credit markets crunched. That credit squeeze reflected a significant slowdown in global growth, including [in] the US.

Most countries experienced their lowest real GDP growth rates in 2019 since the end of the great recession in 2009. Indeed, business investment was falling in most major economies; Japan and parts of Europe were already in a recession or close to it; while several large emerging economies like Mexico, Turkey, Argentina and others were in a slump. So the world economy was weakening and in no shape to handle the pandemic.

The pandemic was the tipping point.

Sputnik: Data from the International Monetary Fund and the Penn World Tables suggest that the US and other major economies were headed towards recession even before the COVID-19 lockdown.

Michael Roberts: Yes, IMF real GDP growth figures for 2019 were at their lowest in ten years. Global trade was falling and the manufacturing sectors of many major economies were contracting. Moreover corporate profits, the life blood of corporate investment, had stopped rising in the major economies, with profitability globally at lows.

Michael Roberts Global corporate profits (weighted mean) % year on year

Sputnik: Can you explain, to a lay-person, the evidence that supports this position and whether you agree with it?

Michael Roberts: In my view, business investment is the key to incomes and employment. And business investment ultimately depends on the profitability of that investment. If profitability is low and even falling, investment will suffer and that situation had already emerged in 2019 before the virus struck.

Michael Roberts Advanced economies investment and savings ratios (% of GDP)

Sputnik: Why should it matter whether or not the US and the global economy were headed towards a recession before ""The Great Lockdown""?

Michael Roberts: The reason it matters is that because the world economy was already showing signs of significant weakness and close to recession in GDP, trade and investment, then it will take much longer to come out of the pandemic slump than otherwise. Many companies (even large ones) may not return once the lockdowns are over and 'normal' business resumes.

Jobs and incomes will be permanently lost. This phenomenon is called in economics, hysteresis, where short-term damage morphs into long-term loss. That is the likely prospect now - something that Fed chair Powell admitted in his recent speech.

Sputnik: Where do you think we are headed if current government policies don't change and why?

Michael Roberts: There is optimistic talk of a V-shaped recovery, i.e. a quick return to previous GDP and investment growth ([which was] already weakening as I have argued). But that assumes lockdowns end quickly, there is no long-term damage, that there is no 'second wave' in the virus and a vaccine is found soon.

More likely, economies will have a U-shaped or even l-shaped recovery because pumping trillions of credit money into the financial system will not deliver recovery if profitability in the productive sectors remains low. What is needed is a massive government investment programme as adopted during WW2 in civilian and green projects to restore growth and employment. A 'Marshall Plan' for the pandemic.

Sputnik: How are everyday people affected by the current crisis?

Michael Roberts: Several studies show that workers earning the lowest pay and in so-called low-skill (but necessary) jobs are taking the biggest hit. Professional workers are able to work from home and have not seen much income loss. Others who must go to work are taking the biggest losses and also face the prospect of having no job to go back to or only after wages and hours cuts.

1845,693,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-frances-strange-defeat/,2020-05-08,Coronavirus: France’s ‘strange defeat’,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Kennedy Jr. Calls for an Investigation,"For over twenty years Bill Gates and his Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have been vaccinating foremost children by the millions in remote areas of poor countries, mostly Africa and Asia.

Most of their vaccination program had disastrous results, causing the very illness (polio, for example in India) and sterilizing young women (Kenya, with modified tetanus vaccines). Many of the children died. Many of the programs were carried out with the backing of the WHO and – yes – the UN Agency responsible for the Protection of Children, UNICEF.

Most of these vaccination campaigns were implemented without the informed-consent of the children, parents, guardians or teachers, nor with the informed-consent, or with forged consent, of the respective government authorities. In the aftermath, The Gates Foundation was sued by governments around the world, Kenya, India, the Philippines – and more.

Bill Gates has a strange image of himself. He sees himself as The Messiah who saves the world through vaccination – and through population reduction.

Around the time, when the 2010 Rockefeller Report was issued, with its even more infamous “Lock Step” Scenario, precisely the scenario of which we are living the beginning right now, Bill Gates talked on a TED show in California, “Innovating to Zero” about the use of energy.

He used this TED presentation to promote his vaccination programs, literally saying, “If we are doing a real good job vaccinating childen, we can reduce the world population by 10% to 15%”.

This sounds very much like eugenics.

Robert. F. Kennedy Exposes Bill Gates’ Vaccination Agenda

Now Mr. Gates and his allies, including Big-Pharma, WHO, UNICEF, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID / NIH, a close ally of Mr. Gates – and of course, Agenda ID2020, are proposing to (force) vaccinate 7 billion people around the globe, with their concoction of a (so far) untested coronavirus vaccine.

This is a multi-billion dollar bonanza for Big Pharma and for all those who support the vaccine. Nobody will really know what the vaccine cocktail will contain. They intend to start with the Global South (Developing Countries) and then gradually move North (Developed Countries).

Mind you, there is no need for a vaccine to cure the corona virus. There are many cures:

French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS.

By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.

1852,1445,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/19/trump-pelosi-hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus/,2020-05-19,"Trump’s use of unproven drug to ward off covid-19 prompts concerns, ridicule. It’s not for the ‘morbidly obese,’ says Pelosi.","But those dire warnings appear to have done little to change the president’s opinion. On Monday, toward the end of a roundtable event with restaurant industry executives at the White House, Trump offered his strongest endorsement of the drug to date.



“I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “Right now.”

He later told reporters: “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this … you know, when I announced this. But, yeah, I have taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here. I’m still here.”



Trump’s announcement that he has been taking the drug in combination with zinc for about 10 days as a preventive measure against the novel virus prompted numerous questions, reactions and concerns, including an unflattering suggestion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the president shouldn’t be using the medicine because he is “morbidly obese.”

“He’s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists,” Pelosi said on CNN in a now-viral clip, “especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say.”



“I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say,” says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Pres. Trump’s revelation he is taking hydroxychloroquine. pic.twitter.com/0ImjpEjg9q — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 19, 2020

It all began Monday with a question about whistleblowers, which prompted Trump to launch into a lengthy tirade that started with Ukraine and impeachment before turning to the most recent whistleblower to draw his anger: former top vaccine official Rick Bright.



“See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win,” Trump told reporters, referring to Bright. “There’s a lot of bad things coming out about him, but you people don’t want to write the news.”

Trump appeared to be angered by Bright’s comments from a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday. In the interview, Bright, who claims he was retaliated against last month for raising concerns about hydroxychloroquine, continued his criticism of the federal government’s handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, calling the response slow and chaotic.



On Monday, Trump pointed out it was Bright who had signed a request to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19.

“Now, if he doesn’t believe in it, why would he sign it?” Trump said, before abruptly pivoting to his startling revelation.



“A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out,” Trump continued. “You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.”

Then, the president revealed front-line workers are not the only group of people taking the drug to protect against the virus. He is, too.



Following a brief pause as reporters digested the news, multiple voices rang out all at once with the same follow-up question: “You’re taking hydroxychloroquine?”

Trump’s claim unleashed a torrent of queries from the journalists in the room — and number of the same questions were repeatedly raised throughout the night as politicians, medical professionals and the general public were left puzzled over the president’s decision.



Chief among the questions that emerged Monday was “why?” Why would the president start taking a drug that experts say has no proven ability to protect against covid-19 and also has potentially deadly side effects?

“Because I think it’s good,” Trump said.



Up against the weight of scientific opinion, he offered “a lot of good stories” that he has heard about it. “And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you. … I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things.”

Trump again claimed front-line workers and “a lot of doctors” take hydroxychloroquine, but he provided no details. He also repeatedly cited letters and calls he said he has received from people heralding the drug’s effects, often referring to one note from an unnamed doctor near Westchester, N.Y.



“He just said, ‘Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine; I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin; and I give them zinc,’ ” Trump said, appearing to quote the letter from memory. “ ‘And out of the hundreds of patients — many hundreds, over 300 patients — I haven’t lost one.’ ”



The reporters, however, kept pressing.

“Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?” one asked.

“No, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ ” Trump said, recalling the conversation with the White House physician. “He said, ‘Well, if you’d like it.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.’ ”

Later Monday, the White House released a letter from Sean P. Conley, Trump’s in-house physician, that confirmed he had spoken with the president about the drug.



“After numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley wrote.



But the letter did not specify whether Conley had written Trump a prescription for hydroxychloroquine or if the president is actually taking “a pill every day,” as he said during Monday’s event.

“I’m taking the two: the zinc and the hydroxy,” Trump said. “And all I can tell you is, so far, I seem to be okay.”

One reporter went on to inquire about another possibility for Trump’s decision to start the regimen, given recent news that at least two people in the White House, including a personal valet to the president, have tested positive for coronavirus.

“Have you been exposed?” the reporter asked.

“No, not at all,” Trump responded, later stressing he has “zero symptoms” and has consistently negative test results.





As Trump continued touting the drug, it didn’t take long for someone to ask, “What is the evidence that it has a preventive effect?”

“Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence,” the president said, spreading his hands wide. “I get a lot of positive calls about it.”

Trump noted that the “only negative” feedback he has heard about the drug comes from an analysis done by academic researchers that examined the medical records of 368 male patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide and found the drug was linked to higher rates of death for those hospitalized with the coronavirus. According to the April study, more than 27 percent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of patients who were treated with a combination of the drug and the antibiotic azithromycin also died. In comparison, the death rate for those who did not receive the drugs was 11.4 percent.



“The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” Trump said, adding, “It was a very unscientific report, by the way. But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, ‘Hey.’ You know the expression I’ve used …? ‘What do you have to lose?’ Okay? ‘What do you have to lose?’ ”

Medical experts quickly rejected Trump’s dismissal of safety concerns.

“There is NO evidence for [hydroxychloroquine] being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease,” tweeted Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. “This is a medication that has serious side effects.”

There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease. This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) May 18, 2020

In an appearance on CNN, Sanjay Gupta, the network’s chief medical correspondent, said Trump “shouldn’t be taking” the drug.

“His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,” Gupta said. “Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.”

While Gupta acknowledged Trump was right in saying the drug has been used to prevent malaria for decades, its use in people who already have coronavirus poses “some real concerns.”

Aside from the medical community, Trump’s comments also struck a nerve with a number of cable news personalities, most notably Fox News’s Neil Cavuto.

“If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,” Cavuto said during his Monday show. “I cannot stress enough: This will kill you.”

“Whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, well, the president of the United States says it’s okay,” Cavuto added. “Not to make a political point here, but a life and death point. Be very, very careful.”",real

The move is the latest large-event casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, joining the cancellation of Chicago’s blues and gospel festivals, announced last week.

“There just is no way that we could make this [happen],” said Ravinia president and CEO Welz Kauffman about Friday’s announcement. “We’ve been wracking our brains trying to figure out how to make the social distancing work and ensure the safety of everyone who comes here — the kids and families, the artists, staff and our neighbors. There was just no way to do it. ... And many artists have already canceled their 2020 tours.”

The season shut-down is the first one since the Great Depression forced the now 116-year-old festival to close its doors from 1932 to 1935.

Ravinia’s 60 full-time staff are being redeployed from their usual duties to handling the cancellation, upcoming developments and next year’s festival plans. “We decided that furloughing was not the way to go,” Kauffman said. Nearly 600 seasonal workers needed each year for the festival will not be hired.

Kauffman said the cancellation was a unanimous and heartbreaking decision by the festivals’ board of directors.

“How was anyone even going to get here?,” Kauffman said. “Nobody’s going to get on a Metra train and then stand in lines to get bags checked and tickets taken one at a time.” Nearly 60,000 people ride Metra to the festival’s front gate each year. Overall, more than 500,000 people attend the festival annually.

This season’s lineup was announced March 12 for shows June 12-Sept. 16. Jill Scott, Patti LaBelle, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Tony Bennett, John Legend and Rodrigo y Gabriela were among the acts that had been booked, in addition to a full summer residency by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of the festival’s newly appointed chief conductor and curator Marin Alsop.

In addition, Ravinia’s famed Steans Music Institute, the summerlong teaching/performance conservatory for young artists, is also shuttered for the year. Plans for online music and educational programming are in the robust discussion stages, Kauffman said.

2020 also marks Kauffman’s final season at the helm of the festival after 20 years, and though he would not comment about his departure, he offered enthusiastic support for the 2021 season.

“I’m just going to continue to work through the particular aspects of the 2020 [season] and then the focus will shift to 2021,” Kauffman said. “I hope I’m able to leave my successor or successors something they can feel good about, and that does mean keeping as much in place from this summer for next summer. We just don’t know yet. In many ways it’s easier to just move someone from one year to another than it is to start fresh. And this season is one we and our audiences were very excited about.”

To date, Kauffman said at least a dozen artists have already requested rescheduled dates for 2021, though he would not elaborate. “We’re still working through all of this.”

Ticketholders can get refunds or vouchers for future performances by calling the box office at (847) 266-5100. Donors are being contacted directly. Patrons can also consider donating their tickets back to Ravinia to help fund outreach programs.

The country's government confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Covid-19 epidemic had ended, after Slovenia's National Institute of Public Health concluded ""all indicators point to a slowdown in the spread of the virus in the population.""

According to data from Slovenia's Ministry of Health, just one new case of the coronavirus was confirmed on Thursday, with no deaths reported. Over the past two weeks, just 35 people had been infected with the coronavirus, according to the health authority, while the reproductive number for the virus — known as the R rating or R0 — was below 1.

An R below 1 means each infected individual will on average transmit the virus to less than one other person.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament that the Balkan country ""has the best epidemiological picture in Europe.""

Despite declaring an end to the epidemic, the government said it would keep measures such as widescale testing, contact tracing and bans on public gatherings in place pending a review on May 31. It will also remain mandatory to wear face coverings in public spaces until at least the end of the month.",real

He was 52.

Sneed’s publicist Bill Carpenter said the singer died early Monday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Sneed earned a Grammy nomination for his work on the Youth For Christ’s 1999 album “Higher.”

Sneed traveled throughout the United States early in his career to sing the gospel with the Georgia Mass Choir. He arranged music on their albums and appeared with the choir in the 1996 film “The Preacher’s Wife,” starring Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington.

Sneed helped form Youth For Christ, which was comprised of members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the Georgia Mass Choir. He served as a producer on Youth For Christ’s “The Struggle Is Over,” which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s gospel songs chart in 2006.

As a solo artist, Sneed released seven albums and had several hit songs within the gospel realm including “Work It Out” and “My Heart Says Yes,” which both peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s gospel chart. He’s also known for the upbeat “Hallelujah.”

Sneed and his wife, Emily, started their own record label Emtro, which is a blend of their first names. Their label became a success with a roster of artists from Alvin Darling & Celebration and Rev. Rudolph McKissick.",real

""It's always a great day to feel healthy after what I went through,"" he said.

Just three weeks ago, he was discharged after a battle against COVID-19.

""I started wondering, how bad is this going to be?"" he said. ""Am I close to dying?

Clark took part in a groundbreaking global trial with early results that showed remdesivir reduced average hospitalizations from 15 to 11 days.

Dr. Aneesh Mehta was the lead investigator of the National Institute of Health trial at Emory University, where she is chief of infectious diseases.

""I think remdesivir, it's going to be one important tool, but we also need to look for other ways to help our patients,"" Mehta said.

In the next phase of the trial, Mehta and her colleagues are adding even more fire power to the fight against COVID-19.

Combining remdesivir — to stop the virus from multiplying — with a powerful anti-inflammatory drug, Baricitinib, a so-called immune modulator that aims to prevent organ damage by calming down an inflamed immune system.

Remdesivir stops the virus from replicating inside the cell. and the immune modulator puts out the fire.

""What the remdesivir here does is it stops the spark and the immune modulator will hopefully be putting dirt on the fire to put it out,"" Mehta said. "" A one-two punch.""



Mehta's team is looking at whether this powerful combination could make recovery even faster and possibly reduce the mortality rate.in a way remdesivir alone has not yet been shown to do.

It's a multiple-drug strategy based on years of AIDS research.

""A drug can block this virus,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, when he announced remdesivir was the first drug shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.

It was reminiscent of a time more than three decades ago when the first HIV treatment emerged.

""It was reminiscent of 34 years ago, in 1986, when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing,"" Fauci said.

It took nearly 10 years to show a combination of drugs was needed to treat AIDS. Now they're applying that lesson learned to COVID-19.",real
1864,2023,https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/undercover-agents-enforcing-state-health-rules-at-restaurants-bars/ar-BB14tFRH?li=BBnb7Kz,,"Undercover agents enforcing state health rules at restaurants, bars","© Provided/Akron Beacon Journal Plainclothes agents with the Ohio Investigative Unit are out checking to see if there's a group larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas, or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games - all things still not alowed under the state health order.

As patrons potentially flock to bars and restaurants over the holiday weekend, extra undercover agents will be out to observe, educate and, if necessary, enforce the state’s public health order to thwart the spread of coronavirus.

The agents are part of the Ohio Investigative Unit, which is made up of plainclothes peace officers responsible for enforcing Ohio’s alcohol, tobacco and food stamp fraud laws.

Along with looking for criminal activity, the officers now are tasked with watching for potential violations of the state’s health order for restaurants and bars to safely operate during the coronavirus pandemic.

The agents can issue administrative citations, which could lead to a hearing with the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. Possible penalties include fines, suspensions or even revoking a business’ liquor permit.

“We just don’t know the compliance rate out there,” Ohio Investigative Unit Enforcement Commander Eric Wolf said. “We certainly expect that a vast majority of the places we visit will be in compliance and do what they have to do.”

Gov. Mike DeWine announced May 18 that members would be added to the investigative unit to check for compliance at bars and restaurants.

Wolf said the undercover agents don’t have a set checklist, but they will look for things such as groups larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games -- all things still not allowed under the state health order.

This will be in addition to their normal duties, like checking for underage alcohol sales and over serving, Wolf said.

To help the unit as bars and restaurants reopen their dining rooms, Wolf said the agency is adding the help of sworn officers from other agencies. Officers from the Ohio Casino Control Commission will be teaming up with the Ohio Investigative Unit. Locally, the Stark County Sheriff’s Office will be pairing deputies with agents as well, Wolf said.

The agents generally work in pairs, Wolf said, and the extra help will let them about double the amount of teams they can send out. In an ideal situation where businesses are following the rules, Wolf said officers would “leave without an establishment knowing we were even there.”

Wolf said the two main goals are observation and education. If a business is doing mostly everything right but has one or two problems, he said an officer would likely just address the issue, and help the owners comply.

He said a big part of enforcing the health order is making sure patrons also know what they need to do to comply and be safe.

“At the same time, we’re trying to get the message out that it’s the patrons' responsibility as well,” Wolf said.

Officers have been doing similar checks while bars and restaurants reopened patios. Wolf said by-and-large, the agency saw very few incidents in which they had to issue violations.

If there is an issue that rises to a violation, Wolf said it would be filed against the business’ liquor permit, and lead to a hearing with the liquor control commission.

Agents will not be shutting down businesses, he said.

The biggest question is what businesses will look like as they reopen. Wolf said people will likely fall into two camps: those who aren’t ready to dine in yet, and those who are cooped up and ready to get out of the house. He said it’s hard to know how many people will fall in each category.

“I’m curious as just about anyone out there on what’s going to happen this weekend,” Wolf said. “We just don’t know.”

Wolf said the Ohio Investigative Unit has committed to bringing on extra officers for at least two weeks. Wolf said this will let them spread out as much as they can, and help people comply, if necessary.

“That’s the biggest push is just more observation and education, and to make sure that everyone has a good and safe holiday weekend,” Wolf said.

This is happening now to poor families involved with the Department of Children and Family Services.

Since March, when the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, children who were taken from their parents by DCFS have not been allowed to have supervised visits with each other or their siblings. In a blanket order, DCFS banned all supervised visits between children, parents, and siblings.

Opinion

Banning supervised visits significantly harms the bond between parent and child and sets vulnerable families up for failure.

As the Cook County public defender, I represent nearly 3,000 parents whose families are DCFS-involved. My clients are poor, and most are parents of color. The visitation ban has negatively impacted already fragile families depriving them of much needed time to bond and stay bonded with their children.

Many parents have very young children who cannot communicate via phone or video conferencing, and because of this ban they are deprived of the opportunity to see, touch and hold their young children. Even mothers who breastfeed their infant children are prevented from doing so.

The Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Health and Human Services has provided guidance on how foster care cases should be handled during this crisis. The Children’s Bureau explained that child protection courts should continue with their mission of reuniting families and doing the business of child welfare agencies.

As the Children’s Bureau has advised:

“Family time is important for child and parent well-being, as well as for efforts toward reunification. Family time is especially important during times of crisis. The Children’s Bureau strongly discourages the issuance of blanket orders that are not specific to each child and family that suspend family time; doing so is contrary to the well-being and best interest of children, may contribute to additional child trauma, and may impede the likelihood of reunification.”

Gov. J.B. Pritzker was one of the first leaders in Illinois to point out that COVID-19 has affected African American families more than any other population in the nation. This DCFS order disproportionately affects African Americans, causing more children to be separated from their biological parents and siblings, aggravating an already tragic and dire crisis in the community. The order serves to worsen the fabric of economically depressed and medically underserved African American communities.

Denying family contact is a horrible misplaced priority that should not be part of our state’s policy. Included in permissible activities during Pritzker’s stay-at-home order are playing golf, purchasing cannabis, getting take-out food and going to a hardware store, yet poor families are banned from visiting their children. This is not acceptable.

Supervised visits can be done in a safe way, like all the other acceptable activities permitted during the shelter-in-place order. If we can safely prepare and distribute food, we can safely allow parents and their children to visit one another.

Whenever a crisis hits, it is the most vulnerable among us that are hit the hardest. It doesn’t have to be that way.

The very genetic code of the planet’s biosphere is being overwritten; The ultimate goal being the ability to manipulate, patent and program at will the biological processes of all life.

Tom Knight, professor at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, said in 2007 that “The genetic code is 3.6 billion years old. It’s time for a rewrite.”

In 2013, Fidelity Investments published a video outlining the future of synthetic biology:

Thinking Big: Synthetic Biology, Fidelity from Tian Hughes on Vimeo.

Synthetic biology, according to a 2005 European Commission paper is “…the engineering of biology… the synthesis of complex, biologically based (or inspired) systems which display functions that do not exist in nature.”

Geneticist Craig Venter is a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology. In 2010 the media hailed his team’s success in creating “the first self-replicating species we’ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer.”

Venter and Google teamed up at secretive gathering that hosted Jeffery Epstein

The Edge Billionaire dinner – comparable to the secretive Bilderberg group – is an annual gathering of tech elites that has hosted Jeffery Epstein, Craig Venter, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Bill Joy and many others.

Physicist Freeman Dyson described the individuals leading this group as having god-like power to create entirely new species on earth in a “New Age of Wonder”. He describes them as:

“…a new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet.”

As revealed in the 2005 book “The Google Story“, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin met with Craig Venter – credited with creating synthetic life – at the Edge Billionaires meeting.

Also present were representatives from the U.S. State Department, Bill Gates, Anne Wojcicki, Bill Joy and dozens of other tech company CEO’s and scientists. The authors write, “Not long after the dinner in California, Brin and Page teamed up with Venter. The biologist gained access to Google’s immense computing power and personnel.”

Coronavirus vaccine to use synthetic DNA created by computers

The New York Times reported on the developing vaccine technology in 2015. As the Times reported, animal tests on the synthetic DNA vaccine “are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”

Now, research-backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will use genetic code created by computers in a potential coronavirus vaccine.

As reported, the Gates-funded synthetic biologists believe that they can “do better” than nature with self-assembling nanoparticles that will be injected into your body:

“With all due respect to nature, synthetic biologists believe they can do better. Using computers, they are designing new, self-assembling protein nanoparticles studded with viral proteins, called antigens: these porcupine-like particles would be the guts of a vaccine.”

The survey, carried out by Press Gazette, asked 2700 people who they thought was doing best at handling the current crisis. Sturgeon came out top, with 29% of the vote, ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer. The poll follows on from a recent Scottish Government survey which gave Nicola Sturgeon a rating of 84% for her slow and measured approach to lockdown. For in defiance of Westminster’s lifting of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, Scotland has until now kept them in place, only hinting recently that some may be lifted on 28th May.

The statistics regarding Sturgeon’s performance will not come as a surprise to many, given the contrast with her Westminster counterpart. Boris Johnson has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Britain. And with the highest death rate in Europe, and second highest death toll in the world, it’s no surprise that questions are being raised. Yet the PM has of late, not provided the consistent, strong leadership required at this time. In contrast to his Scottish counterpart, who gives a daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation in Scotland, without fail; Boris Johnson has not given a press conference for days, and has not been seen in public for days, prompting #WhereisBoris to trend on Twitter. The difference between the two leaders could not be greater; every time Boris puts a foot wrong, it boosts Sturgeon, and the case for Scottish independence.

Unlike the Scottish government, which has yet to make any change to the current social distancing guidelines, other than being able to leave home now twice a day for exercise – instead of once as previously stated – Boris Johnson announced last week that people from different households could now meet; that if required, workers could return to work, and that from 1st June some shops would reopen and some pupils would return to school. The messaging also changed – rather confusingly, from ‘Stay Home’ to ‘Stay Alert’ – with no-one quite clear as to what the latter actually means. The motivation for beginning to lift lockdown measures is no doubt, mainly, economic, with experts warning that the UK is headed for a recession like no other. But there are concerns that Johnson has acted too soon, as with the death toll rising to the virus every day, we could be faced with another ‘peak’ if we return to normality too soon.

For the reality is the virus is still with us, and is likely to remain with us for years to come. Boris Johnson himself gave the example of SARS, for which, he highlighted, a vaccine has not been found in the last 18 years. Although scientists across the globe are working tirelessly in a bid to discover a vaccine as soon as possible, there are no guarantees that they will succeed in the short term. The key in the meantime, will be testing – both for those infected with coronavirus and for immunity, with antibody testing. But the UK government has only recently started to take testing seriously. Early on in the pandemic it downplayed the importance of it, favouring ‘herd immunity ’instead. This was in contrast to countries like China and South Korea that saw testing as a vital way of managing the crisis. Back then, Britain’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ‘We think this virus is likely to be one that comes year on year, becomes like a seasonal virus. Communities will become immune to it and that’s going to be an important part of controlling this longer term. About 60% is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity’. Britain has paid dearly for this ‘laissez-faire approach.

The case against the UK government is building by the day. Aside from the overall death toll of 35, 341, it has been established that an additional 23,000 deaths took place this year in care homes. Far from putting a ‘protective ring’ around care homes as Health Minister Matt Hancock has said, the government has been accused of putting a ‘noose’ around them, with elderly patients effectively like sitting ducks in the wake of the pandemic. It has been observed that no real attempts were made to prevent the spread of coronavirus throughout Britain’s nursing homes, with patients regularly admitted into homes from hospital, without being tested for the virus. Recently it was even reported that Personal Protective Equipment originally intended for care homes was diverted to NHS hospitals. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland admitted on Wednesday that : “We needed to make a choice about testing, we did decide to focus upon the NHS.’

Choices indeed have been made. And increasingly, questions are being raised as to whether the right decisions have been taken – both before and during the pandemic. For at a time when the country is ‘clapping for carers’ every week, in a display of public support for NHS staff, the government is passing its immigration bill, targeting the very migrants who play such an important role in Britain’s health service. As MP Valerie Vaz put it: ‘With this immigration bill the government is effectively clapping them out of the country’. Indeed the harsh reality of Tory policy cannot be escaped during this pandemic. The under-funding of public services over the years, particularly the NHS, primarily by the Conservative government is manifesting itself during this crisis like at no other time. We have entered an era where capitalism is under more strain than ever, where the only solution to this crisis comes from state interference – with the transport industry to care homes to universities all set to require substantial financial aid to survive. A different Britain will emerge from the pandemic.

As for Scotland, it must decide whether it wants to continue being at the receiving end of Tory policies which favour business over people, or whether it will finally carve out for itself a fairer society with welfare at the fore. With a resurgence of coronavirus potentially looming on the horizon, I know which society I’d prefer to live in…

Opinion contributor

Some curious photos began rocketing around social media sites Wednesday night — pictures of people in Wisconsin once again in their natural habitat, crammed shoulder to shoulder in bars.

Fortunately, the patrons were not drinking shots of flaming Lysol or Cloroxtinis. Unfortunately, there were no masks to be found, and the only thing drinkers were distancing from were their inhibitions. Just hours earlier, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had struck down a statewide ""safer at home"" order that, among other things, closed “nonessential” businesses and ordered people to stay in their homes, with limited exceptions. The order itself was fairly standard for states across America.

For weeks, Republicans had argued that their lawsuit against the order was needed simply so the legislature could have some say in the reopening plan. ""We want not a Democratic plan, not a Republican plan, we want a Wisconsin plan where we're all working together,” Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke said May 7.

But now it appears their plan all along was to thwart any plan. Now that they’ve been granted a seat at the table, Republicans have set the table on fire and thrown it out the window.

GOP argued Dem order was confusing

The governor’s unilateral “safer at home"" order was set to expire May 26, at which point a gradual reopening would continue to take place. (Some business restrictions have already been lifted.)

But Republicans in the Wisconsin Legislature challenged the order, complaining that the governor, through his health secretary-designee, had both cut them out of the process and exceeded his authority. They took Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to court, emerging victorious on Wednesday.

The ruling leaves Wisconsin without any statewide rule or guidance in place for businesses, citizens and local governments. After the decision, Republicans said they didn’t see any need for any new rules, instead turning the state into a patchwork of local COVID-19 regulations, stretched throughout nearly 2,000 counties, cities, villages and towns. (Ironically, in the lawsuit, GOP attorneys argued that the statewide order was confusing — but without the order, every local government may now have different regulations and expiration dates.)

This is all taking place in a state that has weathered a decade of all-out partisan war, dating to the days of 2011 when tens of thousands of people occupied the state Capitol protesting Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to virtually eliminate public sector collective bargaining. After an attempt to recall Walker failed, state politics has grown more bitter, culminating in Republicans forcing citizens to vote in-person during a spring election on April 7.

False choices:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

The lawsuit itself was based on a preposterous argument: The legislature argued that the health secretary’s “order,” which, according to state statute does not require legislative oversight, was instead a “rule,” which can be vetoed by lawmakers. But the extremely broad statute granting the executive branch emergency powers explicitly separates the two, saying the department ""may promulgate and enforce rules or issue orders for guarding against the introduction of any communicable disease” (my emphasis). In fact, the legislature specifically added the authority for the governor to issue unilateral orders back in 1982, when the state was grappling with the rapid spread of AIDS.

Basically, the Wisconsin Legislature argued in favor of disregarding a law passed by … the Wisconsin Legislature.

Rush to bars doesn't inspire hope

Nonetheless, as pointed out by liberal Justice Rebecca Dallet in her dissent, four conservative members of the court who won elections by campaigning against the idea of judges writing new laws went ahead and wrote a whole new law merging “orders” with “rules.”

“A majority of this court falls hook, line and sinker for the legislature's tactic to rewrite a duly enacted statute through litigation rather than legislation,” wrote Dallet, adding that “this decision will undoubtedly go down as one of the most blatant examples of judicial activism in this court's history.” (One conservative justice, Brian Hagedorn, sided with the liberal judges in the three-justice minority.)

Coronavirus pause:People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

Having been abandoned by the state, at least 17 communities immediately instituted stay-at-home orders of their own to continue the success the state has had in mitigating the damage of the virus. But on Friday, despite an attorney general opinion that said local governments do have the power to issue such orders as long as there are no criminal penalties attached, at least eight local governments rescinded their orders, leaving their communities unprotected. (The state’s two largest cities, Milwaukee and Madison, kept their regulations, believing they are lawful.)

Ultimately, it is now up to the state’s citizens to practice responsible distancing, wear masks and take other necessary precautions. But the rush to get back to the bars does not inspire confidence that everyone will be taking this seriously enough. At the end of a long night of drinking, beer goggles no doubt make COVID-19 look pretty enticing.

“No school shootings,” she begins. “TRAFFIC is gone, GAS is affordable, BILLS extended ...”

She goes on, quite a bit. Air is cleaner. “The world quieter.”

Opinion

The list ends with this confident assertion: “I’m pretty sure this was God’s way of telling us to slow down and focus on what is important!!”

That old trickster, God. He does have His mysterious ways, doesn’t He? Setting the lives of millions on fire, just so we fortunate few can enjoy the warm glow and toast marshmallows on their burning homes.

Unlimbering the rhetorical bazooka I always keep conveniently slung over my shoulder, I squinted into the gunsight, seeing the tiny figure of my neighbor, smiling over her freshly-coined public wisdom. My finger tensed.

Then I sighed, lowered my weapon, and decided to demonstrate my wit and humanity in a novel fashion: by saying nothing.

Sure, I could have archly pointed out that hiding in the basement could be fun, provided you have a comfortable, well-stocked basement. But not everybody does. These are excruciatingly tough times, and if the scythe hasn’t swung in your direction, yet, the least you can do is not crow about it.

But you can’t scold a joyful person into silent gratitude. Just as you can’t shame a sad one into abandoning their sorrow as insignificant. It’s graduation time. My neighborhood is festooned with college flags, congratulatory signs, balloons, big orange and blue Illini I’s painted on lawns. Online, bursts of milestone festivity, shadowed with a definite sense of loss. No commencement. No prom. It’s not fair! After seeing a few, I considered creating a meme: a soft sepia passport photo of Anne Frank, with the tagline, “Not every teen got to go to prom.” That’ll show ‘em. Think of the retweets! Dozens!

I also held that back. I’m not the coronavirus mullah, wandering cyberspace in my long white beard and black robes, taking a reed switch to the legs of anybody who dares be too happy or too sad. I don’t want to show up at the virtual wake for high school life and castigate the mourners.

People should be allowed their joys and sorrows without strangers whipping out a tape measure. And if they celebrate or mourn a bit too much, well, maybe the sin of pointing it out is worse than either supposed wrong that’s being reprimanded. When the boys were small, and the cat knocked over the younger one’s goldfish bowl, I didn’t harangue him about The Six Million. I dried his tears and presided over the toilet-bowl-side funeral service. It was his fish and he loved it.

Here is the deep, rare and hard-won insight I’ve discovered and want to share, because I find it useful during this crisis, as useful as hand sanitizer: it isn’t all about me. Or you. If you want a clear picture of what it’s like not to grasp this, look to our president. His life teaches many things, but the central lesson is the corrosive power of ego. Ego poisons. It ruins everything, and the more you make every situation about yourself, the worse your life will be. You can be president of the United States, rich, famous, and beloved, in certain quarters, but if you can’t sympathize with anyone, can’t perceive people who are not yourself. then you’re pathetic.

I was griping to a friend last month about the difficulties of living with two men in their early 20s, law students whose schools are closed, who now spend all day lounging around my house, learning to argue incisively when a bell rings. Young men who, I discovered to my surprise and horror, seem to have been raised by a sharp-tongued, not-always-kind individual. Guys who don’t hop to their feet whenever their father shuffles into the room, nor exhibit kindness, or even attention, should he speak.

I expected her to sympathize. She did, but not with me.

“Imagine how hard this must be for them,” my friend Barbara said. “Yanked out of their schools, apart from their friends, stuck with their parents.”

Well .... yeah ... there is that.

I’ve been rolling that phrase around a lot lately. “Imagine how hard this must be for them.”

It’s yours to use as often as you like. Keep it handy, along with your mask.",real

The pandemic has claimed 1,074 lives in India, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The Covid-19 lockdown has had an impact across business sectors. Digital payments platforms are also witnessing a number of challenges in terms of bookings in the entertainment and travel sectors. However, the lockdown due to the pandemic has also opened up new opportunities for digital payments companies. India’s major digital payment firm Paytm, for instance, has seen an increase in medical and insurance payments, among others.

Paytm's Senior Vice-President Amit Veer told Sputnik that the company has experienced a surge in online gaming, OTT content and video apps. He also said with Paytm being a homegrown Indian company, the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy will not have any bearing on it, explaining that the country's new FDI policy bars any investment from Chinese firms into an Indian company without permission from the Central government.

Sputnik: Has Paytm seen any significant increase in digital payments as a result of RBI’s suggestion for people to use digital modes of payment due to social distancing?

Amit Veer: During the ongoing lockdown, we are seeing increased adoption of digital payments for essential payments such as recharges, utility payments, insurance premiums, among others. In fact, more users are relying on varied payment use-cases available on the Paytm app and our teams are ensuring to increase the partnerships. We are confident more Indians will now understand the convenience of digital payments and develop the habit as well.

Sputnik: So what is the company’s experience in terms of data on digital transactions?

Amit Veer: India is embracing digital payments and making it part of their lives and a life-long habit. During the lockdown period, people have been making digital payments. We have seen a 30 percent increase in groceries and the same increase in payments in pharmacies. A 15 percent increase in spending for milk has been seen. As far as the user base is concerned, we have seen a 200 percent growth in the user base during the lockdown. Also, Paytm's had 50000 new sign-ups take place every day. Between 22 March and 15 April, 90 kilograms of gold have been purchased on the Paytm platform and 50 percent have been witnessed in insurance policy purchases. Recharges for DTH, data card and mobile have also seen growth in the period.

Sputnik: How is rural India reacting to digital payments? Please share data on new Paytm users from rural markets.

Amit Veer: Rural India is the backbone of our country and plays an integral role in India's overall growth and development. Paytm has been striving to promote financial inclusion and banking services in rural India and the results have been remarkable so far. We have expanded our services through the length and breadth of rural India. This has immensely helped during this ongoing COVID-19 crisis. More people in rural India have embraced Paytm's services during this lockdown and have been safely paying for utilities online. In fact, now they prefer scanning Paytm QR at their nearby Kirana (grocery) stores, and merchants are also happily accepting digital payments.

Sputnik: How is Paytm ensuring the smooth functioning of its businesses amid COVID-19?

Amit Veer: For us, it’s business as usual. We are working from home and doing our best to provide a seamless payment experience to our country. In fact, we have taken various initiatives, from collecting contribution for the PM Cares Fund to feeding minimum wage workers. Many of our colleagues have also contributed their salaries to this cause. We have ensured that the many frontline workers protecting us have masks and hygiene products are available.

Sputnik: Is there any specific reason for the 200% volume increase in broadband and data card bill payments?

Amit Veer: This growth can be directly attributed to the massive increase in data consumption, as more people are working from home during the lockdown. Also, online gaming, OTT content and video apps have seen a surge in both users and per session log-in time.

Sputnik: What will be the impact of new FDI guidelines, under which government permission has to be taken for investments from Chinese firms?

Amit Veer: Being a homegrown Indian company, the new FDI policy has no impact on us. As you are aware, post our last fundraiser, we are well-capitalised to serve new-age financial services to our fellow countrymen in India and continue our journey towards India's financial inclusion.

Sputnik: With the entertainment and travel sector being impacted in the post-Covid-19 world, which are the new segments where you see growth?

Amit Veer: Paytm Insider has moved towards online events, which are gaining traction. We are confident that these two verticals will bounce back stronger.",fake
1906,664,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/7/21249532/too-much-exercise-during-coronavirus-quarantine-not-a-good-thing-fitness-well-health,2020-05-07,Why too much exercise during your coronavirus quarantine is not a good thing,"The coronavirus crisis upended most Americans’ lifestyles in March — including their exercise routines.

Zipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.

But if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you’re doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.

What is the right amount of exercise during the coronavirus crisis?

The standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.

You might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that’s not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.

“Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn’t alter it because of COVID-19 per se,” says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.

Chris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.

How can I tell if I’m exercising too much?

You can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:

Loss of appetite

Headache

Muscle soreness and tenderness

Fatigue (not during, but later)

Injury

Higher pulse (10 or more beats) the day after exercising

Irritability

Difficulty concentrating

Reduced self-esteem

Weakened immune system

Beyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you’re probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.

The overarching rule is to “listen to your body,” Travers says. It’s OK to skip a day if you’re feeling fatigued.

If you’re feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.

Am I more susceptible to the new coronavirus if I exercise too much?

It’s still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.

Pescatello cautions that while it’s unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn’t want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.

Though studies aren’t available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.

David Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn’t even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.

Existing research data supports the view that overtraining isn’t recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.

“Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,” Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.

Now more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.

“Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,” Sallis says.

I typically don’t exercise. How can I start safely?

Remember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you’re starting out, Pescatello says.

Just lacing up your running sneakers won’t turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.

“You’re not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,” Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run — literally.

On the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.

You’ll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.

“We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,” Nieman says.

I’ve been training for a race. Should I still run the distance?

You can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.

If you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won’t be the same as you planned, but it’s still a way to achieve that goal.

Remember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don’t train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.

So what’s the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don’t overdo it, but don’t do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.

“You don’t really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,” Sallis says.

Senator William E. Brady, the Illinois Minority leader in the state senate, introduced legislation on Wednesday that will give government the right to confiscate property from business owners who defy their lockdown orders.

Senator Brady is a Republican.

According to the proposed legislation SB3993 the government will set “safe place of business protocols” for businesses to follow to reopen.

The protocols include:

The protocols shall include:

(1) customer density limits based on business facilities’ square footage and appropriate social distancing;

(2) face covering requirements for employees; and

(3) regular cleaning regimens.

(d) The Department shall publish additional protocols for specific customer-facing businesses as necessary.

(e) A business that complies with the protocols may reopen and rehire staff at its discretion as soon as is practical.

(f) A hospital or other healthcare facility that abides by the protocols and is located in a Region with adequate intensive care unit capacity may offer the full spectrum of inpatient and outpatient care and treatment to its patients.

The Department shall conduct a public information campaign to explain hospitals’ and healthcare facilities’ safety protocols and to urge patients not to put off any necessary care.

(g) A day care center, as that term is defined under Section 2.09 of the Child Care Act of 1969, may reopen or expand its capacity at its discretion and as soon as is practical if it complies with the protocols.

The legislation then goes on to describe how the Illinois governor can confiscate personal property during a state emergency.

(20 ILCS 3305/7) (from Ch. 127, par. 1057)

Sec. 7. Emergency Powers of the Governor. (4) On behalf of this State to take possession of, and to acquire full title or a lesser specified interest in, any personal property as may be necessary to accomplish the objectives set forth in Section 2 of this Act, including: airplanes, automobiles, trucks, trailers, buses, and other vehicles; coal, oils, gasoline, and other fuels and means of propulsion; explosives, materials, equipment, and supplies; animals and livestock; feed and seed; food and provisions for humans and animals; clothing and bedding; and medicines and medical and surgical supplies; and to take possession of and for a limited period occupy and use any real estate necessary to accomplish those objectives; but only upon the undertaking by the State to pay just compensation therefor as in this Act provided, and then only under the following provisions:

a. The Governor, or the person or persons as the Governor may authorize so to do, may forthwith take possession of property for and on behalf of the State; provided, however, that the Governor or persons shall SB3993 – 5 – LRB101 21409 CPF 72043 b simultaneously with the taking, deliver to the owner or his or her agent, if the identity of the owner or agency is known or readily ascertainable, a signed statement in writing, that shall include the name and address of the owner, the date and place of the taking, description of the property sufficient to identify it, a statement of interest in the property that is being so taken, and, if possible, a statement in writing, signed by the owner, setting forth the sum that he or 0 she is willing to accept as just compensation for the property or use. Whether or not the owner or agent is known or readily ascertainable, a true copy of the statement shall promptly be filed by the Governor or the person with the Director, who shall keep the docket of the statements. In cases where the sum that the owner is willing to accept as just compensation is less than $1,000, copies of the statements shall also be filed by the Director with, and shall be passed upon by an Emergency Management Claims Commission, consisting of 3 disinterested citizens who shall be appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, within 20 days after the Governor’s declaration of a disaster, and if the sum fixed by them as just compensation be less than $1,000 and is accepted in writing by the owner, then the State Treasurer out of funds appropriated for these purposes, shall, upon certification thereof by the Emergency Management Claims Commission, cause the sum so certified forthwith to be paid to the owner. The Emergency Management Claims Commission is hereby given the power to issue appropriate subpoenas and to administer oaths to witnesses and shall keep appropriate minutes and other records of its actions upon and the disposition made of all claims.

And the lawmaker pushing this legislation is a Repubican.

1927,1252,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/17/eric-trump-coronavirus/,2020-05-17,"Eric Trump claims coronavirus is Democratic hoax, will ‘magically’ vanish after 2020 election","“You watch, they’ll milk it every single day between now and November 3,” the younger Trump said. “And guess what, after November 3, coronavirus will magically, all of a sudden, go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.”



He also attacked former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and boasted about crowd sizes at President Trump’s political events.



“They think they’re taking away Donald Trump’s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time,” he said.

The Biden campaign pushed back against Trump’s comments, calling them “unbelievably reckless.”

“We’re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless,” Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “So for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will ‘magically’ disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless.”



She also accused the Trump administration of being “desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis.”



Leading health officials have repeatedly warned that the coronavirus will not go away by fall and that a surge in cases toward the end of the year could be even harder to manage than the current outbreak.

Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said late last month that the global spread of the disease made it “inevitable” that the coronavirus would return or linger beyond the fall. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post a second wave of covid-19 could be worse than the first because it would coincide with the flu season.



President Trump himself has acknowledged the pandemic will remain a public health problem for months. Earlier this month, he said that although he is convinced covid-19 will disappear on its own, it “doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by fall or after the fall.”",real

This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage here.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
“It seems to me if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that’s much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,” Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
“When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,” he said, “you are always behind where you think you are.”
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
“We’re calling the recession,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We have the three elements to make that call — a profound, pervasive and persistent contraction in economic activity.”
Business groups, local and state leaders and a growing chorus of lawmakers and economists begged the federal government to spend trillions of dollars to pay workers to stay home and funnel money to companies struggling with an abrupt end to consumer activity.
The administration floated several ideas for helping industry without conveying a clear plan. After the main trade group for airlines suggested a $50 billion bailout, Mr. Trump’s chief economist, Larry Kudlow, said, “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we’re going to try to help them.”
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.
On Monday, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for the government to cut a $1,000 check, immediately, to every American.
“People don’t have reserves, they live hand-to mouth,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist. “People won’t be able to pay their rents, landlords won’t be able to pay their oil bills, the whole system could break down.”
The consequences of China’s harsh measures to halt the virus — restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point — became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
The Kentucky Derby is postponed until September.For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5. The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Ky., where the race is held, had earlier reported the postponement.
The race, which touts itself as the “most exciting two minutes in sports,” regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators to the famed racetrack with its twin spires.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Racetracks across the country have been shuttered to the public, but races are still being run and bets are still being welcomed. According to The Courier-Journal, the Derby and the weeks of celebration that surround it infuse the region with about $400 million yearly.
In 1945, the Kentucky Derby was held on June 9, about a month after the government lifted a ban on horse racing that it put in place because of World War II. The only other year the race did not take place on the first Saturday in May was in 1901.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro — an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations — seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move “a drastic and necessary measure.”
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. “We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,” he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iván Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
The researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
The E.U. plans to seal itself off from almost all international travel.
The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday.
“We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. “Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.”
The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.
Ten of the 26 countries that make up the passport-free Schengen Area have reintroduced border controls, partly or fully suspending the rules of the flagship European Union program, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
The Trump administration turns on itself.
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president’s reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.
Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold.
“Part of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy he’s always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country,” said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to “shelter in place.”
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to “shelter in place” in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. “It is now time to do your part,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
“It’s asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,” said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only “essential” businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
“I don’t expect anyone to get arrested,” said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. “But it’s not optional. This is mandatory for all of us.”
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Declaring “we are at war,” President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs.
His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine.
Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order.
Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all “non-indispensable” businesses closed.
“We will be able to end the confinement,” Mr. Véran said in a post on Twitter. “But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.”
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily — roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government’s aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers.
“We never considered fighting a flood with buckets,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “We are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.”
Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday’s primary.
Ohio’s governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio’s presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state’s request to push back voting to June 2.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
The lobbying group for America’s biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis.
“This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,” said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. “It requires urgent action.”
The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees.
On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.
United’s corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June.
Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people.
In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
Mr. Johnson called the measures “very draconian,” but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather “giving very strong advice.”
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of “herd immunity” — in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune — while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: “Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”
In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series “The Wire,” announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
“Transparency is probably the best thing for this right now,” said Mr. Elba, 47. “If you’re feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you’ve been exposed, then do something about it. It’s really important.”

1937,652,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/theater/mrs-doubtfire-broadway-shutdown-virus.html,2020-05-07,‘The Universe Hit Pause’: The Ripple Effects of Broadway’s Shutdown,"
Wuhan. Bergamo. Seattle. New Rochelle.By the time cast, crew and fans assembled on March 9 for the first preview of a new musical version of “Mrs. Doubtfire,” the coronavirus was at the stage door.
All over Broadway, theater operators were installing hand sanitizer dispensers and scrubbing armrests. Ticket holders were beginning to bail.
“Hadestown” barred stage-door greetings. An usher who worked at “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Six” tested positive for Covid-19. And “Moulin Rouge!” canceled a day’s performances because a company member was feverish.
“Mrs. Doubtfire” got through three performances before Broadway shut down.“Our house manager texted us and told us to hold on, and then she said, ‘Don’t come, don’t come, don’t come’,” recalled Lisa Berger, a “Doubtfire” usher. “It wasn’t a total surprise, to be honest. I just didn’t think it was going to happen that quickly.”
Now two months have gone by, and almost everyone associated with the production — about 150 people — is out of work: actors and musicians, obviously, but also bartenders and box office workers, carpenters and choreographers, designers and dressers, programmers and propmasters. A few vendors — the publicists, for example — were furloughed and then rehired under the federal Paycheck Protection Program — but even they expect to be unemployed when that money runs out after eight weeks.
“People think of Broadway as very glamorous, but I don’t think they understand how many families and lives depend on it,” said David Korins, the show’s set designer. He was forced to lay off most of his employees after all 24 productions his company was working on, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Beetlejuice,” abruptly stopped.
“Everything went away,” he said. “It was a cascade. And, by the way, I fully endorse it. But, literally, our income went to zero.”
Broadway, of course, is a summit for theatermakers, a symbol of New York and a big business that, until now, had been enjoying an extended boom. Last year was the best attended on record, with 14.6 million patrons; Broadway shows collectively grossed $1.8 billion.
The shutdown brought an abrupt end to that prolonged party. And among the 39 plays and musicals halted were 16 that never even made it to opening night, “Doubtfire” included.
“Doubtfire” was a big bet, aimed squarely at the sweet spot of the Broadway audience: a $17 million musical, adapted from a hit movie, that aspired to be funny, poignant and family-friendly.
Now the “Doubtfire” family has scattered across the country — some as close as Times Square, some as far as London — trying to stay safe and sane. They, like the rest of their theater world colleagues, have no idea when New York will settle in to some new normal, no idea when Broadway will attempt a comeback. They are worried, but also hopeful — a microcosm of an industry that is distressed but determined.
‘We’re doing the right thing.’“Mrs. Doubtfire” is a story about family. One family, really: The Hillards — Daniel, Miranda and their three children. The parents split up, and the father (memorably portrayed in the 1993 film by Robin Williams) is so determined to spend time with his children that he pretends to be a woman to land a job as the housekeeper.
Hilarity ensues. Trouble looms. Lessons are learned.After a five-week pre-Broadway run at Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater, the stage adaptation headed for Broadway facing headwinds — reviews in Seattle were mixed, shifting gender politics had made men in dresses an unreliable laugh line, and a stage adaptation of “Tootsie” had just flopped. Plus, every Broadway show is enormously risky, because most of them fail.
But the producers, led by the Broadway veteran Kevin McCollum (“Rent,” “Avenue Q”), were feeling confident as they sped toward an April 5 opening night. The audiences in Seattle seemed to like the show. And the lead actor, Rob McClure, who scored a Tony nomination for playing the title role in “Chaplin,” starred in “Honeymoon in Vegas,” and was featured most recently in “Beetlejuice,” was nailing his bifurcated performance.
Then, McClure said, “The universe hit pause.”On that final day, the cast had gathered for an afternoon rehearsal knowing that, at any time, Broadway might shut down. “I’ll never forget checking my phone during our Wednesday evening performance and seeing that the N.B.A. had suspended the season, and knowing what was coming,” said Brad Oscar, a two-time Tony nominee for “Something Rotten!” and “The Producers.”
Jenn Gambatese, the actress starring as Miranda (a role played on film by Sally Field), was center stage, rehearsing new blocking for her big solo number, when a stage manager told the company to brace for a closing announcement. She kept going for another 90 minutes.
“I felt calmer than I had in a while, and felt like I could focus better,” said Gambatese, who had been so unnerved by the drumbeat of virus news that she brought a suitcase to work in case her commuter rail line was shut down and she got stuck in Midtown. “Every day was getting scarier and scarier,” she said.
Midafternoon, McCollum and the show’s director, Jerry Zaks, assembled the company and told everyone to grab their stuff and go home.
And just like that, it was over. The costumes were stored in dressing rooms. The souvenir tote bags and tumblers were locked in a cabinet. The ghost light — a bare bulb placed onstage when a theater is empty — was illuminated.
Many expected they’d be back in four weeks — the initial projected length of the shutdown. “I remember placing my pencil down on my script and thinking to myself, ‘It’s so weird — that pencil is going to be in exactly the same place when we come back in a month,’” said Philip S. Rosenberg, the lighting designer.
McClure went home to Philadelphia. Tara Llewellyn, a dresser, joined her grandmother in Connecticut. KJ Hippensteel, a member of the ensemble, fled to his father-in-law’s house in Cleveland with his wife and their two sons.
“Both of us lost our jobs, for now, and we had no reason to stay,” he said. “Really, we panicked and had to take action to feel like we were in control. In hindsight I think we were super lucky to have gotten out when we did.”
Among those who stayed: Peter Bartlett, a comedic character actor and the oldest member of the cast, who plays a television host named Mr. Jolly. “At 77, this is the true passages of terror,” he said.
Most of the time, Bartlett has been holed up in his one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, sustained by savings, Social Security and union pensions, talking to friends, reading, cleaning his kitchen and washing his hands. “Did I ever think I’d watch a dog rescue on YouTube? Now I’ve watched hundreds of them,” he said. “Anything to distract myself.”
Others are finding their own distractions, like making ice cream, or practicing yoga. “Destruction leaves a lot of creative space to occupy,” said Akilah Ayanna, an ensemble member who is working on an album.
So Alexandra Matteo, a company member who understudies several parts, is podcasting. Tommy Kurzman, the makeup and prosthetics designer, adopted a dog. Paul Woodiel, the concertmaster, is singing cowboy songs with his wife (they are both violinists).
“We have nice harmonies going on ‘Keep on the Sunny Side,’” he said, “if only I could get through the lyrics without choking up.”
‘It has upended our lives.’Broadway is a coveted corner of the theater world for many reasons — prestige, large audiences, enormous talent. But it’s important for a much more materialistic reason: in a low-paying, high unemployment field, it’s a place where theater artists can earn a good salary. The base pay for actors on Broadway is about $2,200 a week.
But the shutdown has thrown thousands out of work. Most union members got a few weeks’ pay after the closing, but that has long since ended. And the usual fallbacks when stage shows are scarce — television, film, even waiting tables — are unavailable during this phase of the pandemic.
“Pretty much everyone I know is planning on not paying their rent, because how are we expected to do that?” said Cameron Rasmussen, one of the show’s three guitarists.
Several members of the company are married to others in the industry, meaning they are now facing a double income loss. Michael Rico Cohen, a stage manager, is married to a freelance television producer. “It’s going to be quite a few months before either of us sees a real paycheck again,” he said. And Colleen Dietz, the show’s music copyist (preparing the score for individual musicians), is married to Zachary Dietz, the music director. “I know we will come back from this, but it will be a long, hard road for New York and for our family,” she said.
Among the more complex predicaments is that facing the family of 9-year-old Lily Tamburo, who was cast as the understudy for Natalie, one of the three Hillard children. Lily lives in the Setaukets, on Long Island, with her mother and three older siblings; when the late-night commute proved too exhausting at her age, her mother, Lauren Zummo, rented an apartment in the city for the two of them. But when the pandemic hit, Zummo was forced to shut down the Pilates and yoga studio she runs on Long Island, and, of course, Lily lost her income. Zummo was able to walk away from the Manhattan sublet, but not the studio, where her landlord is insisting on being paid.
“The virus has bankrupted us, obviously,” Zummo said.This pandemic is primarily a public health crisis, and Broadway has been hit hard by the disease — multiple members of the “Moulin Rouge!” cast fell ill, as did a number of theater artists, producers and publicists. The “Doubtfire” family has been relatively fortunate on that front, but not unscathed.
Korins, the set designer, lost his uncle to Covid-19. He was 80, and had just moved in January from Florida to Yonkers, N.Y., where he fell ill at an assisted-living facility and died at a hospital. “He died alone, not having spoken to anyone for several days,” Korins said. “It’s one of those unbelievably tragic moments.”
Others have found themselves caring for those infected. Calvin L. Cooper, an actor in the ensemble, saw one friend test positive for Covid-19, and then another fall ill.
“For nine long, scary days I helped nurse my friend back to stable levels,” he said. “He is called presumably positive. I am presumably asymptomatic.”
And both members of the show’s choreography team — Lorin Latarro, the choreographer, and MJ Slinger, her associate, are partnered with doctors who worked with Covid patients. Latarro is married to a neurosurgeon who was redeployed to Covid care; she and their 2-year-old daughter moved out for several weeks to avoid infection. “I know some families have it worse,” she said. “We are back home together now.”
‘I can’t control if my voice changes.’Maria Dalanno was one of the last people to join the “Doubtfire” cast. She was 18 and still in high school in Ohio when she submitted an audition video shot by her mother; five days later, she booked a part as the understudy for Lydia, the older Hillard daughter.
She left high school, deferred college and moved to New York. Now she’s back home, playing with her dog and painting.
“I made my debut in previews, and then moved right back home in the midst of a pandemic,” she said. “I am now worrying about following social distancing guidelines, being able to pay for my apartment, and when I will see my new friends and castmates again.”
For the six performers playing children in the “Doubtfire” cast — each character has an understudy — the shutdown has been particularly tough to understand.
“Getting a break on Broadway, especially for a child, is nothing short of a miracle,” said Shanna Sell, whose 9-year-old daughter, Avery Sell, was making her Broadway debut as Natalie, the younger Hillard daughter. The Sells live in Florida, and Avery is now back in New Port Richey. “Having the rug pulled out from underneath her little feet, just weeks before her debut, has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” Shanna Sell said.
Jake Ryan Flynn, the 13-year-old Massachusetts boy who plays the Hillards’ son, Christopher, has his own concern — that if the Broadway shutdown drags on, he will age out of the role. This is his second Broadway show — he was one of three boys alternating in the title role of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and he knows that contracts allow producers to replace children as they grow too tall.
“My parents keep telling me to only worry about what I can control,” he said. “But right now it feels like I’m in control of nothing in my life. I can’t control if I grow. I can’t control if my voice changes. I can’t control when I will see my cast mates again. I can’t control if the creatives and producers take a look at me in a few months and fire me because I’m too big. It just makes me sad.”
‘It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.’The invitations came from Mark Evans, a Welsh actor playing Stuart Dunmire, the new love interest for Miranda Hillard.
Put on something fun. Grab a snack or a drink. Turn on your computer.On April 5, the night that “Doubtfire” was scheduled to open on Broadway, the company instead gathered online and performed the show — beginning to end — just for one another.
They called it their Fauxpening. Eighty-two people participated. Kaleigh Cronin, an ensemble member sheltering with her husband and dog at her parents’ house in New Hampshire, wore the dress from her 8th grade dance, which she found in her childhood closet.
There were speeches and stories, songs and slip-ups — Evans was so busy organizing that when the second act rolled around he forgot his lines. Onscreen, the actors sang their songs. In the chat section, some of the stage managers typed out cues.
“Zoom was still a novelty, as opposed to the norm,” Evans said. “It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.”
There are other forms of connection, too. Felicia Shulman, the guardian responsible for protecting the show’s child actors, has tried to knit the four youngest members of the cast together through group texts and FaceTime. “Keeping them all in touch is something that I think is very important during this time of the unknown,” she said.
There’s also a newsletter of sorts. Aaron Kaburick, an actor who plays several minor characters including a “Chef Louis,” distributes a weekly email. It was originally called “Chicken on the Block,” a reference to the show’s spatchcocking scene; it’s now called “Chicken on the Couch,” because of the quarantine. The publication is just a few sentences — fabricated gossip, inside jokes, the ensemble member Doreen Montalvo’s recipe for “Quarantine Coquito” and a “Doubtfire”-choreography-inspired workout routine from Casey Garvin, an understudy.
And there are ongoing get-togethers. Fauxpening was three weeks and three days after the closing, so, at Gambatese’s suggestion, the company decided to plan another reunion every three weeks and three days. The second one was late last month. “It was adorable,” McClure said. “We shouted over one another.”
‘It’s so empty, it’s unreal.’The Stephen Sondheim Theater, where “Doubtfire” was being staged, exhibits many of Broadway’s real estate complexities. Its history, and its facade on West 43rd Street, go back to 1918, but the interior, which opened in 2009, is underground, beneath the 55-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park.
The 1,055-seat theater is operated by a nonprofit, the Roundabout Theater Company, which is renting it to the commercial producers of “Mrs. Doubtfire.”
The building is still “Doubtfire”-branded, with a marquee and pastel-colored posters promoting the show. But there are also signs of the times: Anita’s Way, a pedestrian passage alongside the theater, has become, with the disappearance of pedestrians, a resting spot for the homeless.
The only person still regularly going inside is Deosarran, a one-named 58-year-old Guyanese immigrant who works for Roundabout as a building engineer.
Once or twice a week, Deosarran — everyone calls him Dino — gets into his car and drives in to Times Square from his home in Harrison, N.J., to make his rounds at the four theaters Roundabout operates in Midtown. He starts early — around 5 a.m. — to increase the ease of social distancing, and he checks the buildings’ temperature, the humidity, the plumbing and even the roofs.
“In the beginning I was nervous, but I bought some masks and gloves and I mingle with no one,” said Deosarran, who moved to the United States at age 14, took a job pumping gas and has been working in Broadway theaters for most of his adult life. “It’s very strange to see these theaters with no show. On 42nd Street you see one or two people walking. It’s unbelievable.”
There are other eyes on the building — security, cops and a few less expected observers. Connie Robinson, the manager of theater operations for Roundabout, monitors by video camera from her home in the Bronx while baking up a storm — sweet potato buns, banana pudding cheesecake, crepes. “It’s so empty, it’s unreal,” she said.
And James Kabel, the wardrobe supervisor, walks over from his apartment in Times Square. He gazes at the “Doubtfire” images on the theater’s windows, just “to make sure it’s not just a dream.”
‘I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen.’It was one of the first scenes the writers cooked up: Deep in the second act, Daniel Hillard would have a nightmare in which he is haunted by multiple Mrs. Doubtfires, forcing him to confront his feelings of inadequacy.
The power rock song, “You’ve Created a Monster,” was rousingly sung, wild to look at (a stageful of Doubtfires!), and regularly prompted applause. But gnawing at the creative team was the sense that it stopped the storytelling.
The problem: The number as written suggested that Daniel Hillard’s big fear was that Mrs. Doubtfire was better than him. But the musical is fueled by his more fundamental terror: that he would lose his children.
So, in one of the surest signs that Team “Doubtfire” fully expects the show to return, the now-dispersed creative team, who previously collaborated on “Something Rotten!”, overhauled the song via Skype. Wayne Kirkpatrick, back home in Nashville; his brother, Karey Kirkpatrick, in Los Angeles; and John O’Farrell, in London.
So they decided to refocus the scene. “You can’t have a song that’s not moving the story forward,” Karey Kirkpatrick said. “So we made it about the kids — they’re no longer dressed as Doubtfires, and there are lyric changes to support the storytelling.”
And they set about shortening the musical’s ending. “You want to leave them wanting more, as opposed to saying get on with it already,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
Trimming was not easy because in the final 12 minutes McClure has six costume changes, from Hillard to Doubtfire and back again — and each one takes at least 23 seconds. But the writers now have a series of proposed cuts they want to test whenever they get back to the stage.
“If you just listen, the show will tell you what it needs,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
It’s unclear what happens next. Industry leaders say that September is the earliest they can imagine Broadway resuming performances, but that it is possible shows won’t return until next year.
Broadway has multiple vulnerabilities: high costs, tightly packed seating, and a fan base that includes many tourists and seniors.
The longer the shutdown continues, the more shows are expected to close before even opening, succumbing to cash flow issues and economic concerns. Zaks, a four-time Tony winner directing on Broadway for the 25th time with “Doubtfire,” refuses even to consider that this show could be among the missing. “I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen,” he said.
He can take solace from McCollum, the lead producer, who vows that “Doubtfire” will return. “I’m sad that everyone has to wait, but the show is ready to go, and when people gather, we’ll be ready to open,” he said. “We’re birthing this new piece, and I can’t wait to show it to the world.”
As for McClure, the show’s star, he is practicing a combination of patience and optimism.“I don’t think it would be in Broadway’s best interest to open too soon and be part of another wave of this — I don’t think anyone in our industry is interested in that,” he said. “But when I think about the first night back, when the overture starts and the curtain goes up, I choke up. I really do. It’s the culmination of everything we’re craving — more than the singing and the dancing and this great American art form, it’s a bunch of people telling a story and a bunch of people receiving a story. We’re craving the collective experience of being human. And that’s what theater is.”",real
1939,1021,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-news-un-maternity-wards-in-yemen-are-out-of-money/,2020-05-15,"48,000 Yemeni women could die giving birth as UN starts shutting down maternity services due to funding gap","London — The United Nations agency that runs maternity wards and maternal health services across war-torn Yemen says the program is nearly out of money. The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.

It's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.

UNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.

""By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,"" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.

""It's grave,"" he said. ""It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and… you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.""

World's worst humanitarian crisis

Before the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.

""And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,"" Owomuhangi said.

People in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.

""They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,"" Owomuhangi said.

Women's health and COVID-19

UNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.

""It's already the minimum service,"" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. ""These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly – the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,"" he said.

Even before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.

""Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?"" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., ""to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.""

Only a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, but on Friday, the international healthcare nonprofit Doctors Without Borders said that, because testing capacity in the country is ""extremely limited, it is impossible to know the full extent of the spread of the virus."" The charity Save the Children said it has seen a surge in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - approximately 50 people a day over the last week.

""Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,"" Owomuhangi said. ""And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.""",real

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” the mayor said.

“But it’s a mistake to gather in large congregate settings — particularly if you have an underlying medical condition [or] you are otherwise in a vulnerable population. That’s hopefully the dialogue that we’ll be able to have with the pastor.”

Lightfoot has not hesitated to play the heavy during the pandemic.

She shut down the lakefront, the Riverwalk and the 606 Trail when Chicagoans could not be trusted to avoid gathering in large groups and drove around the city breaking up those gatherings. She cut off citywide liquor sales at 9 p.m.

Why, then, wasn’t the service at the Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church shut down?

“Our plan has always been to educate people into compliance. If we can do that, we will do that. We don’t want to take more aggressive measures unless we’re forced to do that because people are defying it,” the mayor said.

“But we’re not gonna have a circumstance where people are blatantly ignoring the rules that have been put in place to help save peoples’ lives.”

The mayor said she had a “very pleasant conversation” with Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, on Monday and hopes to have a follow-up conversation soon.

Last week, Elim Romanian and Logos Baptist ministries in Niles asked for a temporary restraining order preventing them from facing criminal repercussions for hosting services while vowing to impose strict social distancing measures.

Speaking in his native Romanian, Cristian Ionescu, Elim Romanian’s senior pastor, told his flock the move to hold services is “not a rebellion for the sake of rebellion” and claimed the Constitution grants them the right to worship during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We feel that we are discriminated against,” Ionescu told the Chicago Sun-Times, noting large groups of people are allowed to shop at grocery and hardware stores. “We follow the same rules as other places that are also considered essential, and yet we cannot have more than 10 people in a service, which is ridiculous.”

On Sunday, Elim Romanian took considerable steps to adhere to the state’s social distancing and public safety guidelines: Masks, gloves and hand sanitizer were made available, temperature checks were conducted at the door, and capacity was limited to 120 worshippers, though the church’s main auditorium and overflow rooms can hold 1,300.

Roughly 70 people were in attendance, including the church leadership, band and choir.

The vast majority of congregants didn’t wear masks during the service. But almost everyone put one on before leaving. And when the service was winding down, Ionescu sternly directed his followers to stay 6 feet apart and warned against congregating outside.

“Why is this important? We are being watched,” he said. “We are being recorded.”

In Arizona, use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for prophylaxis in medical workers is “strictly forbidden” by Executive Order of Gov. Doug Ducey unless peer-reviewed evidence becomes available. In all but four states, prescribing or dispensing HCQ for COVID-19 is restricted.

We have known about COVID-19 for about four months; it can take years to plan, complete, and publish a randomized, double-blind controlled study. However, in 2005, the CDC Special Pathogens Branch described three mechanisms by which chloroquine might work and have both a prophylactic and therapeutic role in coronavirus infections. More than 20 relevant studies have been published in journals indexed in PubMed between Jan 28 and April 20, 2020.

AAPS concludes that: “the safety of Hydroxychloroquine is well documented. When the safe use of this drug is projected against its apparent effect of decreasing the progression of early cases to ventilator use, it is difficult to understand the reluctance of the authorities in charge of U.S. pandemic management to recommend its use in early COVID-19 cases.”

Additionally, AAPS is compiling observational results reported from China, France, South Korea, Algeria, and the U.S. Of 2,333 patients treated with HCQ, 2,137 or 91.6 percent improved clinically. There were 63 deaths, all but 11 in a single retrospective report from the Veterans Administration where the patients were severely ill.

Apr 27 data show that U.S. COVID-19 death rates are at least eight times higher than in countries with early and prophylactic use of HCQ.

Country # of cases # of deaths Deaths/million Use of HCQ India 27,890 881 0.6 Early and prophylactic Costa Rica 695 6 1.0 Early and prophylactic Australia 6,716 83 3.0 Early and prophylactic South Korea 10,728 242 5.0 Early and prophylactic Brazil 62,859 4,271 20.0 Early and prophylactic Israel 15,443 201 23.0 Early, some prophylactic use U.S. 987,160 55,413 167.0 Late, in hospitalized patients

India reported 4,970 new cases over the previous 24 hours, taking its total to 101,139. Deaths rose by 134 to 3,163.

India’s number of cases has easily outstripped that of China, where the virus emerged late last year and which has been one of Asia’s infection hot spots.

China has reported nearly 83,000 cases but has kept its daily rise in new infections to single digits for the past week.

In contrast, new cases in India have risen by an average of more than 4,000 a day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally based on official data, despite a severe weeks-long lockdown.

India officially extended the lockdown on Sunday to May 31, although several states indicated they would allow businesses to reopen.

Health experts and officials are worried about the strain the epidemic is placing on India’s over-stretched and under-funded hospital system.

Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, told Reuters last month that India probably had only about 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators.

Chaudhry warned there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff in the country of 1.35 billion people to handle a sharp spike in the number of critical patients.

While not every coronavirus patient needs an ICU bed, health experts worry about surging cases in India, particularly as many believe the official tally falls short of the reality.

India has not provided a detailed breakdown on the condition of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, although authorities have reported that about 37,000 people have recovered.

India’s death rate is less than that of some other big countries, at 3%, compared with about 6% for the United States, where some 89,000 people have died, and 14% for Britain.",real

Opinion contributor

The push to release inmates to protect populations inside and outside of prison from COVID-19 has exposed our institutional trigger finger when it comes to locking people up.

About 40% of the incarcerated population doesn’t present a public safety concern, according to a 2016 Brennan Center for Justice report. If our system was more justice oriented and less punitive, we wouldn’t now be scrambling for so many compassionate releases.

Getting “tough on crime” was supposed to rehabilitate society, clear it of repetitively malignant socioeconomic outcomes across communities and create a permanent feeling of safety. Instead it has done nothing but overcrowd prisons, making each a petri dish for COVID-19. This explosive combination of unnecessarily high incarceration rates and a global pandemic accelerates the need to create a better, more holistic approach to justice in America.

In the wake of COVID-19 and tightening state and federal budgets, there is an opportunity for significant nationwide expansion of alternatives to incarceration and detention, and impactful reform of the justice system.

COLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching

Here are three changes that could fundamentally redefine our criminal justice system: practicing restorative justice, implementing misdemeanor reform and passing legislation that would eliminate punishment for parole violations.

Restorative justice, not punitive justice

Punitive justice focuses primarily on punishments. Restorative justice focuses on the relationship between the offender and the victim and centers the needs of survivors in ways that the traditional court system does not.

Programs based on this approach are being used right now in youth courts, such as the Red Hook Community Justice Center and Harlem Community Justice Center, and by Impact Justice’s Restorative Justice Project. The work interrupts the cycle of offending, repairs harm caused to the victim and the community, and incorporates restorative healing circles.

Restorative justice programs have higher survivor satisfaction rates than punitive systems.

Programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion in Seattle are also important. The program partners civilians with local police to divert offenders to needed resources without making an arrest.

Misdemeanor reforms

Misdemeanors make the U.S. criminal justice system a profit center. They make up 80% of state criminal dockets, putting throngs of people into U.S. jails and prisons.

COLUMN:During COVID-19 crisis, prioritize release of pregnant inmates

Misdemeanors vary in severity from jaywalking to unpaid parking tickets and third-degree assault. While the latter may need stronger consequences, facing jail time for not being able to pay a speeding ticket or jaywalking isn’t just.

Misdemeanor shouldn't be done away with, but our justice system must enforce appropriate consequences for offenses rather than disproportionate punishments.

Don't arrest for parole violations

Passing legislation that would eliminate parole violations would go a long way toward keeping people out of prisons and jails who don't belong there.

New York City's Less is More Act is a great example of how to get that done. The act, if passed, would eliminate technical parole violations. The state's taxpayers spent million of dollars last year incarcerating folks for technical parole violations. New York wouldn't be the first to take steps that eliminate parole violations. After South Carolina adopted sanctions — which included disciplinary actions outside of incarceration — violations decreased and recidivism dropped.

Permitting people to earn accelerated discharge off community supervision will responsibly shrink the number of people subject to such supervision, and allow us to concentrate our finite resources on those who are most in need of attention.

We have tried punitive measures. We’ve gotten “tough on crime,” and what has resulted are broken people, shattered communities, and a system of courts, law enforcement divisions and prison operations that depend financially on the incarceration of Americans.

COLUMN:Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act

We cannot continue this way and consider ourselves a free and peaceful society.

Committing to restorative justice and implementing reforms will restructure the justice system, reduce the burden on the taxpayer and extend the compassionate action that has been a rallying point during COVID-19.

We’ve learned during the pandemic that how we treat each other, whether down the hall or across town, impacts our collective freedom and health; it’s time to extend generosity and love to our neighbors who have been impacted by the justice system.

Ambrosio Medrano released from prison over coronavirus concerns,"Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.

Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.

But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

A Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Medrano made the move Wednesday, transferring to “community confinement” from a federal prison camp in Duluth, Minnesota.

Pissetzky said prison officials identified Medrano, 66, as someone who met the criteria for compassionate release amid the coronavirus pandemic. He said Medrano did not file any paperwork with the Bureau of Prisons seeking the transfer.

Early in 2014, two federal judges presiding over separate cases handed Medrano a total of 13 years in prison over corrupt deals involving bribes and kickbacks.

Having already been handed a 2 ½-year sentence in the 1990s for accepting bribes on the City Council, a federal judge told Medrano he had pulled off an “unprecedented . . . corruption trifecta.”

Former Cook County Commissioner Joseph Mario Moreno, a co-defendant in one of Medrano’s cases, is also seeking compassionate release due to the coronavirus. Moreno is not due out of prison until January 2024.

8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.

9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.

11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.

On creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator.

Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets.

I did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, ""Don't even ask me about it."" That was hilarious.

On dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.

6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it ""Hayl's Kitchen."" She directs, ""Wash this, watch this, peel this."" We like to watch shows like ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes"" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, ""Babe, we need those things."" And I'm like, ""Sorry, sorry."" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.

Dessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, ""I didn't know we had that machine."" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.

On working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24/7 is when we started to become like, ""OK, we might've reached our limit here."" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, ""OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here."" It's like, ""OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible."" So it's been good.

What I'm streaming: We knocked out ""Tiger King"" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through ""Ozark,"" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" which is a great transformational show.

11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.

When quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up ""National Geographic."" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.

1972,861,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-misinformation-disputed-tweets-claims-coronavirus/,2020-05-13,Twitter to label misinformation about coronavirus amid flood of false claims and conspiracy theories,"Twitter announced Monday that it will start alerting users when a tweet makes disputed or misleading claims about the coronavirus.

The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a ""lighter touch"" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.

An example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the ""public interest"" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.

Politicians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.""

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.

""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.

The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an ""arbiter of the truth"" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.

One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.

The War on Science

Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.",real

For many people around the world, everyday life—working, shopping, exercise, entertainment, even connecting with loved ones—now takes place on a screen. Some of the activities that have gone virtual would have seemed unimaginable just a few months ago, like attending funerals and graduation ceremonies, teaching elementary school, hosting television shows, and, recently, pretending to be ants.

Since early March, a private Facebook group titled simply “A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony” has attracted more than 1.8 million members. The premise is as bizarre as it is self-explanatory: People join the group and act like ants. That’s it. That’s the whole idea. Originally founded in June 2019, the group had a modest following until social distancing rules went into effect earlier this year, sending the numbers skyrocketing. Once accepted by the moderators, users role-play as ants in a variety of ways, posting from the imagined perspective of members of a vast and collaborative colony. Most of those posts consist of images of food with captions like “help me bring this to The Queen!” to which other users comment “LIFT” or “HELP.” Others include calls for assistance in “TUNNEL #75642” and announcements that “someone just peed on my whole family.”

For a scientific perspective on this strange and strangely wholesome corner of the internet, Slate spoke to Allison Cohen, a biologist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco—and a member of the virtual ant colony herself. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Slate: How did you first hear about the Facebook group?

Allison Cohen: I want to say it was a week into quarantine. The lab had recently closed, and, like most people, I was at home talking to all of my colleagues on the internet. Our watercooler conversation had all gone digital, and we’d been sending a lot of memes and jokes to one another on Slack. One day, one of my lab mates slacked me a link to this Facebook group, and that was when it all started.

Why did you join?

Well, at first I was very confused. But I was quite curious, so I applied, and, once the moderators let me in, it turned out to be surprisingly wholesome and fascinating and fun and low-risk. I usually stay off of Facebook, honestly. I don’t post a whole lot. I’m a little bit afraid of the internet. Maybe you can relate to that, as a reporter. The nice thing is that you’re anonymous because you’re in this … colony … right? So whatever comment you make on anything, nobody can really jump on you personally.

What kind of research do you do?

I am a biologist, but I study mostly fungus. The lab I work in studies a particular kind of fungal infection, a fungus you can inhale that can make you sick. Our labs have been shut down for a little while now, and I recently started volunteering to test COVID samples.

How does the group’s role-play compare to what you know about actual ant behavior? Is it similar at all?

I don’t know a ton about ants, but my understanding is that they do communicate with one another to make collective decisions. This kind of insect behavior is a really cool area of biology right now. There are actually some great ant science articles on the group page that link to studies about the division of labor within colonies between forager ants and soldier ants. So I guess in that way it’s similar.

How do you participate in the group?

I’m mostly just a viewer and an occasional commenter. I haven’t posted anything. I also think, as it has gotten bigger, some bad behavior has begun to crop up. The world has started seeping in. The moderators are trying to control it, but it has gotten a little too big, I think. It’s out of hand. I have begun to see posts about coronavirus and Trump, which is against the rules technically, and it’s also just a bummer. That’s just not something I want to deal with right now.

“I’m really just here for the ants.” — Allison Cohen

How often would you say you check the group?

It has kinda taken up my Facebook feed. There are hundreds of posts every day, and each one gets thousands of comments and likes and responses, so I’m sort of flooded by it. I probably look at it—and this is a hard thing to admit—at least once or twice a day.

What are the most memorable things you have seen on the page?

I have been really into the scientific articles. There was one where researchers were tracking the movement of ants in a colony, and they found that there is one subset of ants that doesn’t seem to be working all that much, and then another subset of ants that seems to be working a lot. So there was a pretty funny thread about that, with people really railing on the lazy ants.

Also, as a mycologist, I’ve always been really fascinated by the Cordyceps fungus, also known as the “zombie fungus,” which infects ants and changes their behavior in a way that favors the fungus. There are direct parallels here to infectious diseases in mammals. For example, the rabies virus is able to completely change the behavior of its hosts to favor transfer of virus in saliva, the parasite Toxoplasma seems to make mice less afraid of predators, and I’ve been seeing a lot of work lately suggesting that the microbes living in our gut can change our behavior. Scientists are only beginning to understand these phenomena. Also, the behavioral infection control practices of ants are really sophisticated, and it’s hard not to draw parallels between those behaviors and what we’re trying to do to stop the spread of COVID-19.

I know explicitly mentioning politics and COVID-19 is against the rules of the group, but do you feel like allusions to the real human world are present?

Oh, God, yes. Despite the rules, it still is pretty explicit. There have been some “essential worker” comments that have cropped up. And some references to communism, which, if you had to pick a political system for ants, it would probably be some sort of communist dictatorship.

Are you into the political stuff, or would you prefer it to be … just ants?

I would prefer just ants. I’m really just here for the ants. Though I will say I enjoy making puns every once in a while, which I guess qualifies as a human activity. There are a lot of ant puns. I just don’t like it when it gets too serious.

What’s an example of an ant pun?

Ulysses S. GrANT. ObamANT. ANTmanuel Macron.

Why do you think the group has become so popular?

Well, I can’t speak to anyone else’s reason for being there, but for me it’s kind of a release. It’s a break from all the serious and upsetting conversations taking place on the internet, on Facebook and other places. Especially right now. For me it is pure escapism.

I can understand that. But … why ants?

I have no idea. I mean, ants are really cool. Plus, ants are accessible. They’re everywhere. As a scientist, I have always been into ants. And I think the weird experiment in collective action is really interesting right now. Also, the group has really developed its own little culture now. It has also developed this whole weird linguistic style. Everyone writes in all-caps and with spaces between the letters, which is something I haven’t seen anywhere else on the internet. I’m guessing it is sort of a founder effect. Like, the first couple members started doing that, and then it caught on. Seeing how this little microcosm develops and changes is, to me, sort of endlessly fascinating.

While it’s clear that the group is a joke and many of the posts are quite funny, it seems to be more than that, too. For the most part, the people engaging with it are very earnest and committed to maintaining the game.

Yeah, I think everyone is just really burnt out on bad news right now. And burnt out on news in general. The internet and social media can be so manipulative. I think people, especially people of younger generations, are so used to everything on the internet having some agenda or marketing campaign or political fuel behind it. We are used to the toxicity and the fighting. And so what is so great and refreshing about this group is that it’s just simple and pure. It’s just ants.",real
1980,697,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/08/us/08reuters-health-coronavirus-copper-antimicrobial.html,2020-05-08,Copper Takes Aim at COVID-19 With Virus-Killer Coatings,"
MELBOURNE — At an outer suburban manufacturing plant, engineer Byron Kennedy is resetting a machine to spray-print a layer of copper on to a door handle, aiming to use the metal's antiviral properties to counter the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.
His firm Spee3D is better known as a producer of 3D printers for copper and aluminium, used by customers including the Australian defence force and U.S. Marines to rapidly print new parts to get broken equipment back in action without waiting days for spares to arrive.
""Up until the end of last year, our business was building the 3D printers, which were then used to build parts,"" Spee3D co-founder Kennedy told Reuters.
""Come 2020, and the epidemic hits. We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought 'Can we do something, can we help out here?'""
Copper's disinfectant powers have long been known and its antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been supported by scientific studies.
Spee3D commissioned Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to look at how SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, reacts to copper surfaces.
The results showed that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours, compared to no change on stainless steel surfaces over the same period, Kennedy said.
This is in line with a U.S.-government funded study https://bit.ly/2WdhxZR published in March that found SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for up to 4 hours on copper, compared with 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.
Spee3D then reset some of its machines to be able to coat surfaces such as door handles and push plates, and has already received orders from two Australian government departments to resurface door handles before staff return to work.
The Northern Territory's Trade, Business and Innovation Department said in a statement it was thrilled to adopt the technology to make its workplace safer.
The firm is also speaking with a big miner and several major door handle manufacturers about additional applications, Kennedy said.
SLOW TAKE-UPCopper had already been making some inroads into the healthcare sector after trials in hospitals, including in the U.S. state of Virginia https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30696-4/fulltext, in recent years.
However, attempts by fabricators in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to sell copper alloy products into the sector resulted in only a modest take-up, partly due to costs, said John Fennell, Chief Executive of the International Copper Association Australia.
""We are seeing outcrops of people adopting this, but not as much as you would have thought,"" he said.
COVID-19 looks set to give the metal a boost.In major copper producer Chile, the country's mines minister recently touted the use of copper in face masks, such as those produced by a U.S.-Chilean company, while U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan believes the pandemic will shine a light on how copper can help improve public health.
""Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper, which has been a barrier in the past, is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told a briefing last week.
New manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are also a potential game-changer as they can allow ultra-thin coatings to be applied quickly, while still taking advantage of copper's antimicrobial properties and cutting the amount of metal used, and therefore the cost.
The price of coating a standard office door handle is about A$50-A$100 ($33-$65), says Kennedy, although costs will fall over time.
Disappointing copper bulls, it's likely the new coating methods will keep a lid on the amount of metal used in healthcare, said analyst Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank in Melbourne.
""I think we can confidently say demand for copper for those uses will go up, quite possibly by a lot. Is that going to shift the dial for global demand? At this stage I doubt it,"" he said.

(CD) – America’s billionaires saw their combined net worth soar by $434 billion between March 18 and May 19 while the coronavirus pandemic killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged the U.S. economy, forcing more than 30 million out of work.

That’s according to a new analysis released Thursday by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) titled “Tale of Two Crises: Billionaires Gain as Workers Feel Pandemic Pain.”

“The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality.” —Frank Clemente, Americans for Tax Fairness

The report shows that the five wealthiest billionaires in the U.S.—Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, and Larry Ellison of Oracle—saw their collective wealth grow by a total of $75.5 billion between March 18 and May 19, a 19% jump.

ATF and IPS pinpoint March 18 as “the rough start date of the pandemic shutdown, when most federal and state economic restrictions were in place.”

Bezos—the world’s richest man—saw his wealth jump by nearly $35 billion in the two-month period. Yet even as Bezos’ fortune continues to grow, Amazon announced last week that it will not extend $2-an-hour hazard pay for warehouse workers beyond the end of May.

“The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality,” Frank Clemente, ATF’s executive director, said in a statement.

⏰It’s that time again:⏰ Our weekly @inequalityorg update on how much U.S. billionaires are profiting off the same pandemic that’s forcing millions out of work. There’s been some shocking numbers so far. But this week is a knockout. pic.twitter.com/pWW79IZMOo — Institute for Policy Studies (@IPS_DC) May 21, 2020

Chuck Collins, director of the IPS Program on Inequality, said “the surge in billionaire wealth during a global pandemic underscores the grotesque nature of unequal sacrifice.”

“While millions risk their lives and livelihoods as first responders and front line workers,” said Collins, “these billionaires benefit from an economy and tax system that is wired to funnel wealth to the top.”

1987,662,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250830/waymo-self-driving-resume-testing-coronavirus-arizona-drivers-concerns,2020-05-07,"As Waymo resumes self-driving tests, backup drivers are still worried about the virus","Waymo is planning to resume testing its autonomous vehicles in Arizona on May 11th, nearly two months after pausing its robotaxi service as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But some of the company’s backup drivers are worried that Waymo may be rushing back into service too quickly.

In a blog post, the company said it was taking a “tiered approach” to returning its vehicles to the road. Waymo says it has redesigned its vehicle depots in Arizona to conform with social distancing guidelines, including limiting the number of people that will be allowed inside at any given time. Employees will receive personal protective gear, like face masks and gloves. And the facilities and the company’s fleet of autonomous vehicles will be cleaned multiple times a day.

In addition, employees will receive temperature checks when arriving for work each day. And employees who are at high risk for COVID-19, or who have child care issues, can opt to work from home. Each vehicle will only feature one backup driver during testing to comply with social distancing guidelines.

But the company won’t be fully operational. Waymo’s ride-hailing service, Waymo One, will remain on pause. And Waymo says it won’t resume testing in other cities like San Francisco, Detroit, and Los Angeles until the company is convinced it’s safe.

“We’re taking a thoughtful and measured approach towards bringing our driving operations back on the road”

“We’re taking a thoughtful and measured approach towards bringing our driving operations back on the road,” the company said in a blog post.

But the company’s operations team, which is largely comprised of employees who work for Waymo’s third-party contractor — a French transit company called Transdev North America — is not all convinced of the company’s commitment to safety.

“The measures they’re taking seem above and beyond on paper,” said one Arizona-based backup driver. “But at the same time, Arizona hasn’t seen 14 days of new case decline yet either.”

There have been almost 10,000 cases of COVID-19 in Arizona, and 450 deaths, according to AZ Central. The state’s Republican Governor Doug Ducey announced recently the phased reopening of the state’s businesses, including salons, restaurants, and coffee shops.

One member of Waymo’s operations team, who is based at the company’s Mountain View, California headquarters, expressed concern that Waymo will try to resume testing too early. Most the test rides in California are done with two employees in the vehicle. Unlike Arizona, very few of the company’s California ops team is trained to ride in the company’s autonomous vehicles by themselves, the driver said. (A Waymo spokesperson said the majority of Waymo’s drivers are trained and certified to drive in a single-driver configuration.)

“But at the same time, Arizona hasn’t seen 14 days of new case decline yet either”

“It feels like they’re using [Arizona] as a control group to decide if they can push us back in,” said the driver. “Arizona has always gotten test policies and whatnot first, but this seems like way too large of a risk since the number of deaths and cases is still increasing.” (A Waymo spokesperson noted that driving operations first resumed at the company’s closed testing site in Central California two weeks ago.)

As The Verge has previously reported, tension is high between Waymo and its operation staff since the company signed a contract with Transdev last year. Vacation time was cut, health insurance didn’t improve, and issues of workplace safety went unaddressed, according to a half-dozen workers who spoke to The Verge for a story last month. And drivers said they were increasingly nervous about picking up passengers amid the growing COVID-19 pandemic, and that the outbreak is exposing divisions between drivers and full-time employees at the Google spinoff.

But Waymo has continued to pay its workers despite two months of downtime, while other self-driving companies have cut their operations staff. The Arizona-based driver said the company appears to be listening to employee concerns about rushing too quickly back into testing and ride-hailing.

“[Waymo One] was a huge sticking point with drivers at the beginning of this,” the driver said, “so hopefully they got the message and don’t even consider it until we are at whatever our new normal is.”

1999,21,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/reducing-diagnostic-time-coronavirus/,2020-02-17,Reducing Diagnostic Time Of Coronavirus,"The coronavirus is showing no signs of slowing down, making it important to improve the current method of diagnosing it which can take an hour or longer. Now, a new technology based on a combination of optics and magnetic particles can test 100 samples and reduce the diagnostic time down to about 15 minutes.

Currently there are over 80 reported clinical trials running in China to test possible coronavirus treatments, and the first new case has been reported in Africa, prompting concern over the spread of the virus after arriving in countries that may be vulnerable due to economic status or political instability.

According to Dr. Amos Danielli of the Alexander Kofkin Faculty of Engineering at Bar-IIan University this new technology can carry out saliva test analysis within 15 minutes, and the technology has already been proven to reduce diagnostic time of Zika virus and it is being used in the Israel Ministry of Health’s central virology laboratory.

Danielli’s lab developed a technology for sensitive detection of virus specific RNA sequences by attaching the virus RNA to a fluorescent molecule that emits light when illuminated by a laser beam; at very low concentrations of RNA the signal emitted is so low that existing devices can’t detect it. Magnetic particles that have been added to the solution enable them to adhere to the fluorescent molecules which allows for a greater concentration of fluorescent molecules and more accurate measurement.

""If we think of the saliva of a corona patient filling an entire room, then this laser beam can be compared to the size of a fist and at low concentrations of virus RNA, there might be only 2-3 fluorescent molecules within that fist,"" explains Danielli.

""This development relies on the use of two small electromagnets, which are magnets powered by an electric current. By properly positioning them, we were able to create a strong magnetic field and collect all the thousands of fluorescent molecules from the entire solution and aggregate them inside the laser beam, thereby multiplying the signal strength by several orders of magnitude. But that's not all. Instead of pumping the solution we alternately operate the electromagnets, once on the left and once on the right, moving the molecules from side to side, in and out of the laser beam. As they pass through the laser beam they become illuminated. When they exit the light beam they are no longer illuminated. This flickering allows us, without any additional procedures, to accurately determine whether a person has been exposed to coronavirus,” said Danielli.

High sensitivity and ease of operation of the platform enables facilities to use this technology in point of care applications where resources are limited to provide doctors with an alternative method for accurate and rapid detection. The researchers are also collaborating with European universities to identify antibodies that the immune system may be producing against the coronavirus; and he is looking for investors to help accelerate his R&D of the kit to get it introduced into hospitals.

Dr. Danielli develops systems/kits to help identify various diseases, while companies such as MagBiosense are developing devices about the size of a coffee machine which will be based on Dr. Danielli’s technology.",fake

But Levin has an idea about when he thinks it needs to restart.

“A lot of our teams want to play; they do want to play,” Levin told the Sun-Times. “The question is, can they play? If May 1 turns out to be a hard date, maybe we can. If it gets pushed any past that, I think probably not.”

Like the rest of the North American sports world, the Wolves and the AHL are waiting for their next steps. They’re watching to see how the COVID-19 pandemic plays out and whether it will dissipate enough to allow the season to come back. And if it does return, how it would look is uncertain.

The ECHL already has canceled its season. And on Monday, the AHL announced its indefinite suspension won’t be lifted before May.

In most cases, the criteria for games wouldn’t be complicated. It is now.

“Something that says groups can get together again,” Levin said. “That’s going to have to happen. Nobody knows when that’s going to happen.”

Unlike the NBA, Major League Baseball and NHL, AHL teams can’t rely on media-rights fees to help them avoid substantial losses through a period without games. The Wolves lost three games last weekend and are dropping at least five more home dates at Allstate Arena.

Levin didn’t say how much that hit the Wolves, but he admitted the three games were “a lot of money.”

“I haven’t looked at the economic impact, really, but that’s not really where I’m at right now,” Levin said. “I’m just worried about other people and the situation going on around here.”

For the Wolves, that means anybody who can is working remotely. The players have left, and Levin said AHL teams have been advised they can melt the ice in their buildings. As of Tuesday, however, the Wolves hadn’t.

The Wolves also are processing refunds for people who had bought tickets, but that’s not easy because of the circumstances.

“We’re just in a holding pattern,” Levin said. “We’ve got to get money back to people and groups that bought tickets. There’s a lot of things that have to happen. It’s going to take a little time getting organized. Frankly, we’re short-handed because we don’t want to have everybody working in the same area.”

There is also the business of hockey to attend to. For the Wolves, that means finalizing a new parent club for next year. Levin sounded excited about the future, though he didn’t divulge which teams he had spoken with about a potential partnership.

That, after all, isn’t the priority these days.

“Obviously, these people have other concerns at the moment,” Levin said. “Their NHL teams are down. Their buildings are down. You can’t call them and say, ‘Hey, do you want to talk about this right now?’ I don’t think it’s the most important thing on their minds.

“We’re just going to wait and see. That’s all we can do.”",real
2004,1796,https://www.politico.eu/article/france-elections-philippe-macron-coronavirus/,2020-05-22,France sets date for second round of local elections,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Most Russians (80%) started going out less or stopped doing it completely as coronavirus continues spreading in Russia.

An opinion poll conducted by WCIOM All-Russian Research Fund, showed that the number of Russians who leave their homes for a walk has dropped twice. As many as 76% of respondents admitted that they started going to grocery stores or pharmacies a lot less frequently.

The absolute majority of respondents refused from personal meetings with friends and acquaintances - 84%.

69% said that they stopped shaking hands and giving hugs when meeting friends and acquaintances.

76 percent of the polled said that leave homes for urgent needs less frequently too.

88% of Muscovites said that they stopped leaving homes.

69%, said that they stopped meeting with their elderly relatives.

77% of Muscovites said that they avoid tactical contacts, while 58% stopped doing it completely.

90% of Muscovites have completely isolated themselves from friends and acquaintances.

Although the self-isolation index data show that Russians began to violate this regime more often, the majority (90%) of Muscovites polled by VTsIOM claim that most of their friends and relatives observe the rules of self-isolation. In Russia, the figure is lower, but not significantly - Most Russians (63%) assess the measures of the Russian authorities as sufficient. Over the five days since March 29, the share of those sharing this position increased by 11%, and the share of those who evaluated the measures as insufficient fell from 38% (March 29) to 26% (April 2).",fake
