“Breaking: Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,” Trump tweeted. “This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”

Both Michigan and Nevada are considered potential swing states in the November election.

The president followed up with a tweet tagging Russ Vought, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and the U.S. Treasury Department.

Trump’s threat to halt funding was issued hours after floods forced the evacuation of about 10,000 people in central Michigan. He didn’t specify what kinds of federal aid he would stop, or cite a legal basis for the action.

The president is scheduled to visit a Ford ventilator-assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced a plan to send applications for absentee ballots to all registered voters in the state ahead of its elections in August and November.

There have been more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Michigan to date, and more than 5,000 deaths.

“By mailing applications, we have ensured that no Michigander has to choose between their health and their right to vote,” Benson said in a statement. “Voting by mail is easy, convenient, safe and secure, and every voter in Michigan has the right to do it.”

Under normal circumstances, it is up to voters to request an absentee ballot, which are restricted to those voters who are traveling or temporarily residing away from their usual residence. About a third of the states require a specific reason to vote by mail. More than half allow voters to request mail-in ballots without one.

Benson quickly responded to Trump on Twitter.

Hi! 👋🏼 I also have a name, it’s Jocelyn Benson. And we sent applications, not ballots. Just like my GOP colleagues in Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska and West Virginia. https://t.co/kBsu4nHvOy — Jocelyn Benson (@JocelynBenson) May 20, 2020

The president made the same threat against Nevada, again raising without evidence the specter of voter fraud.

“State of Nevada ‘thinks’ that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “They can’t! If they do, ‘I think’ I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections.”

Nevada has made its June 9 state primaries an all-mail election, sending absentee ballots to registered voters. According to Reuters, the state official responsible for elections is a Republican.

There is no evidence that voting by absentee ballot leads to more voter fraud. Trump himself voted by absentee ballot in the Florida primary in March. Yet he continues to rail against the practice.

During a coronavirus briefing at the White House last month, Trump said he was opposed to mail-in ballots because “people cheat.”

“No, mail ballots, they cheat,” he said. “OK, people cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they are cheaters.”

At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was asked about Trump’s tweeted threat against the state’s contingency plans.

“For 10 weeks we have been in the midst of battling COVID-19,” Whitmer said. “The people of this great state have done their part and we have seen our numbers flatten. We're not out of the woods yet. But it's taken a lot of sacrifice and it has not been easy.

“On top of this 100-year event, we have a 500-year event in a flood that has absolutely devastated a lot of families, a lot of communities,” she continued. “To see Twitter this morning, to see rhetoric like that is disheartening because I think it first shows you that there maybe was a lack of understanding of what the secretary of state was doing. She said we're going to mail applications, not ballots.”",real

The two vehicles are critical pieces of NASA’s ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon by 2024, but with development temporarily suspended, meeting that deadline will become even more unlikely.

The shutdown comes amid NASA’s decision to heighten restrictions at two of the agency’s centers. The Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi are both moving to Stage 4 within NASA’s “Response Framework” for dealing with the pandemic, which is the strictest stage. That means telework is absolutely mandatory and all travel is suspended. The change was made after an employee at Stennis tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to a blog post by NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. No one at Michoud has tested positive for the virus yet, but there is a rising number of cases near the center.

Michoud and Stennis are both moving to Stage 4

Both centers play critical roles in the development of NASA’s next big rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. Cores of the rocket are primarily built at Michoud by NASA personnel and employees of Boeing, the vehicle’s main contractor. Meanwhile, the first completed core of the SLS is currently at Stennis, where it’s scheduled to undergo a significant ground test later this year. Called the Green Run Test, the exercise will ignite all of the engines on the rocket while it’s held down, simulating a launch without actually going to space. The test is meant to pave the way for the inaugural launch of the SLS, which is currently slated for 2021.

Now, with both centers restricting access, the production of new SLS cores and the work needed to prepare for the Green Run Test is coming to a halt. “The NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,” Bridenstine wrote in his update. “Once this is complete, personnel allowed onsite will be limited to those needed to protect life and critical infrastructure.” NASA is reassessing which personnel will be considered “mission critical” and allowed on site at each facility.

The shutdown is another blow for the SLS program, which suffered from delays and cost overruns long before the pandemic began. Originally slated for launch in 2017, the rocket’s first flight won’t happen until late next year at the earliest, and its first flight with crew on board is currently planned for either 2022 or 2023. The program’s budget has ballooned over the last decade as well, with the total development cost expected to reach $18.3 billion by the time rocket flies, according to a recent report from NASA’s Inspector General.

Despite all this trouble, the SLS is a key part of NASA’s Artemis program to land the first woman on the Moon. The vehicle’s third flight is meant to carry astronauts on that historic mission to the lunar surface. Given the 2024 deadline set by the Trump administration, there was already very little wiggle room with the current SLS schedule to meet that timeframe. A shutdown like this puts that goal in jeopardy — something NASA acknowledges.

“We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions.”

“We realize there will be impacts to NASA missions, but as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the NASA workforce,” Bridenstine wrote.

The other critical piece of hardware needed for the Artemis program is the Orion crew capsule, which the astronauts will ride inside when launching on top of the SLS. The Orion capsule that will fly on the debut flight of the SLS just underwent testing in Ohio and is about to travel to Cape Canaveral, Florida, ahead of the launch next year. It now seems that once Orion makes it to Florida, work on that vehicle will shut down temporarily. Meanwhile, work on future Orion crew capsules will stop at Michoud.

With this latest move, three of NASA’s centers are at Stage 4, along with Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. The rest are at Stage 3, which allows mission-essential personnel to access NASA centers and travel. As the novel coronavirus situation worsens, it likely won’t be long until all of the centers move to Stage 4. It’s unclear how that will impact the rest of NASA’s activities, such as launches out of Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston maintains that its flight controllers can continue to operate the International Space Station even at Stage 4.

“I will continue to say, so none of us forget – there is no team better prepared for doing hard things,” Bridenstine wrote in his post. “Take care of yourself, your family, and your NASA team.”",real

J.B. Pritzker talking Thursday about the “phased reopening of some of our state parks,” I immediately thought I would be at Mazonia State Fish and Wildlife Area at dawn on May 1, both to fish and to forage for morel mushrooms.

Not so fast, Mazonia was not on the reopening list. The cooling lakes in northeast Illinois were not either.

So now, my plan is hit Kankakee River State Park the morning of Friday, May 1. I am certain I will not be alone in wanting to hit the 10 or so miles of shoreline there along the Kankakee River.

Readers had a bunch of questions related to the limited reopening of Illinois Department of Natural Resources sites and also about whether the easing of some restrictions would mean anything for the forest preserves restrictions.

Below is what I’ve gathered so far on turkey hunting, trout season, access and reasoning for site openings or still being closed, and an update from the Forest Preserve District of Will County.

Click here for the latest from the IDNR on the evolving opening of some sites. While reading the list of activities mentioned, I did not see turkey hunting listed. Early May has the final days of turkey hunting for those holding permits for specific sites.

So I contacted IDNR deputy director Rachel Torbert, who emailed back Friday:

To ensure the safety of all visitors, hunting remains suspended at state parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas. Understanding closure and fee concerns raised by permit holders, IDNR is reviewing all possible solutions, including refunds for all spring 2020 turkey permits issued by the Department. Additional information will be provided via the IDNR website as soon as it is available.

This is where things get intertwined, with no turkey hunting at the IDNR sites that reopen, no longer do morel foragers or birdwatchers need to wait until 1 p.m. to begin wandering the woods and fields. They can begin doing so at dawn on May 1 at those sites reopening.

* * *

While reaching out to Torbert, I also asked for the reasoning on not opening the cooling lakes and she replied:

Protecting the health and safety of our site visitors, staff and first responders is our highest priority. With that in mind, IDNR worked with Governor Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health to develop a list of state parks, fish and wildlife areas, recreational areas and historic sites which considered many factors. Selected sites represent parks, fish and wildlife areas and recreational areas which are distributed throughout the state and are accessible to many, offer a wide variety of recreational opportunities with acreage to allow for social distancing directives, provide necessary restroom and handwashing facilities, and have on-site staff to ensure the safety of visitors and maintenance of the site and site facilities. Safety of park visitors and potential strain on staff, first responders and law enforcement also were considered when reviewing potential sites. IDNR will continue to work closely with the Governor’s Office and the Illinois Department of Public Health as directives change to further assess site closures.

Technically, I understand, but I wish they would reconsider on the cooling lakes.

I understand keeping the high-volume, high-density, sites, such as Starved Rock SP and William W. Powers State Recreational Area and Illinois Beach SP closed, but some of the lesser sites not being reopened have me scratching my head.

* * *

As to trout season at the Forest Preserves of Cook County sites, director of communications Carl Vogel emailed Friday, “We do not currently have plans for a date for the start of trout season.’’

The opening of trout season in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County is on hold, pending further review, as communications lead Deb Humiston emailed Friday:

I found out that we’re waiting to review the official signed executive order from the governor’s office when it’s available. We’ll then adjust our operations as needed to align with the revise/extended order. We’ll communicate any adjustments — which will start on May 1 — next week.

Stay tuned on the trout season there and a couple other nearby sites.

Here’s the key paragraphs on the easing of some restrictions at the Forest Preserve District of Will County:

The Forest Preserve District of Will County will reopen its preserve access area parking lots and boat launches on Friday, May 1, as a result of Gov. J.B. Pritzker modifying his stay-at-home order, which was instituted March 21 to fight the new coronavirus pandemic in Illinois. However, all visitor centers, dog parks, latrines and water fountains will remain closed through the duration of the stay-at-home mandate’s extension, which now ends May 30. All public programs, rentals and non-district events have been canceled through May 30. Because the Monee Reservoir visitor center/concessions building is closed, there will be no boat rentals until further notice. These closures and cancellations will remain in effect to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, which could overwhelm healthcare institutions and cause more deaths. Once parking lots reopen May 1, people should not be congregating in the preserves and at trailheads, which could spread COVID-19. It may be necessary to temporarily close sites where social distancing is not being maintained.

That last paragraph is important.

Some business shifts seem like natural moves — restaurants offering takeout, venues livestreaming concerts or retailers scaling up online sales.

Businesses that are based around gathering people together for a tour, a game, travel or a conference are finding new ways to get money coming in the door.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours can't load up buses of strangers to take them on a tour of Milwaukee these days. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements make it nearly impossible. Even with the easing of restrictions, it's unknown when the general public will feel comfortable gathering again.

The company started receiving phone calls for cancellations as soon as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By the next day, more than $200,000 in business was canceled or refunded, said company owner Theresa Nemetz.

""Within 48 hours, I realized we were completely out of business unless we pivot,"" Nemetz said.

Can these stores survive?:Can these 13 retailers outlast coronavirus?

Lost Penney? J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores – or 242 locations – as part of its bankruptcy

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

Marla Poytinger isn't sure when her company will be able to bring 1,500 people through her bars for ax throwing, mini-golf, shuffleboard and painting again on a Saturday night.

The live, host-led trivia game her company launched during the pandemic will remain part of Bars & Recreation Inc.'s business line after bars open.

""Even if the world goes back to normal, which I don’t think anyone expects, there is still a huge market of people who ... still need to gather and interact but can’t or aren't willing to come together physically,"" Poytinger said. Public games are $9 per registration, which can include all the people quarantined together.

The company, which runs Axe MKE, Splash Studio, NorthSouth Club and Nine Below, is seeing maybe just 1% of its normal revenue, she said.

Many businesses like hers would lose all their revenue unless a new product could be sold.

Daniel Cruz was launching his new laundry service for Airbnb hosts, Washbnb, as the pandemic halted travel. The company faced a total loss. Cruz thought about shutting down, but laundry still needs to get done, even during a pandemic.

Washbnb shifted gears to offering services to people who are elderly or immunocompromised in the Milwaukee community, charging around $10 to $20 a load with delivery. The company is also offering a pay-what-you-can model. It is operating at a loss and actively looking for investors to raise $450,000.

Nearly all the trade shows that BoothCentral Inc. works with to manage vendors are canceled for the foreseeable future.

""No events are collecting vendor payment,"" said BoothCentral co-founder Tim Gill. ""We had to pivot or we would be at a standstill.""

BoothCentral's development team built a new platform out in 10 days to replicate the experience of an in-person trade show. This is not just a live stream. The virtual event page contains a main livestream and vendor rooms, among other areas, with the goal to replicate the buzz of an in-person event.

It held its first virtual event in the middle of April.

""We didn't go into this thinking it would be extended this long,"" he said. ""But we just knew that we had to do something.""

On its new platform, BoothCentral is hosting art fairs, home and garden shows, and career fairs. The company is now growing and hiring to add to its staff of 10 employees. Even once in-person events are held again, BoothCentral anticipates hybrid models with online components.

""There is no going back to normal at this point,"" Gill said. ""We see that this is going to be the new way.""

26,1438,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-switzerland-breaki/breakingviews-cox-quarantine-in-switzerland-is-surprise-luxury-idUSKBN22V1HQ,2020-05-19,Breakingviews - Cox: Quarantine in Switzerland is surprise luxury,"ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - The queue stretched from behind the former convent for European aristocratic women an entire city block to the affluent shopping street of Bahnhofstrasse. Lines like this are common in the coronavirus era. Consumers across the world have had to wait to enter stores and limit purchases of staples like toilet paper or pasta. Saturday’s human traffic jam in downtown Zurich was different.

A flag flutters on the Swiss Parliament Building (Bundeshaus), after the weekly governmental meeting in Bern, Switzerland, November 27, 2019.

The horde on the pavement, none in face masks, was clamouring to get inside Gucci’s boutique. There’s nothing essential about a $870 pair of Screener GG Mignon trainers. Nor was this the only throng: the sidewalks were also packed in front of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany’s and other high-end shops. It was as if the Great Lockdown had come, and simply vanished.

Hard to say whether Switzerland’s experience, or that of neighbouring Germany and Austria, is a harbinger of what to expect from reopening countries like Italy, France, Great Britain and the United States. It will be a few weeks before data is available to determine whether a swift return to something approaching normality results in a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.

“Right now, it’s like we are in that moment after you have taken an exam and you are just waiting to see the results,” says Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive of UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank.

But there will be lessons to glean from Switzerland’s handling of the virus and subsequent quarantine, which has been surprisingly luxurious compared to the experiences of many other developed nations. The takeaway may be as simple as this: societies that prize self-responsibility, respect for rules and institutions – and plan for rainy days – are better places to shelter from the storm.

“One of the most underestimated factors is to what extent people have faith in their governments, and do they listen to them,” says James Breiding, author of “Swiss Made: The Untold Story Behind Switzerland’s Success”. Lack of trust has impeded efforts by the United Kingdom and United States to deal with Covid-19. In Switzerland, “the ballast is informed and engaged citizens who argue to the point of anarchy; and expect representatives to work for them with veto right if they screw up, (through) referendum.”

Switzerland, where direct democracy is practiced and cantons have wide-ranging powers, has been far from perfect in dealing with the pandemic. As the virus spread across the Italian border in late February, federal officials in Bern was slow to respond. There have been over 1,880 deaths from Covid-19, a rate of 218 per million population. That ranks it about the tenth worst among major nations. Yet it’s half the rate of France and Italy, across whose frontiers many healthcare workers cross to staff Swiss hospitals.

Once the seven-member Federal Council, presided by Simonetta Sommaruga, gave the order in mid-March to stay home, the strengths of the Swiss system became apparent. Non-essential shops were closed. Pasta and toilet paper shelves were briefly empty in some busier supermarkets but there was none of the panic buying seen in America and Britain. That’s partly thanks to the National Economic Supply Act, designed to guarantee a supply for up to six months of essential goods like sugar, cereals and medicines, and services in times of serious shortages.

If an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, then Switzerland may be the country version of the Boy Scouts. That’s evident in the private sector, too, notes Ermotti. Some 70% of UBS clients who took advantage of a 40 billion Swiss franc pool of government-backed loans had no previous credit line or debt. Moreover, only 40% of firms participating in the programme have drawn down their credit lines. “It really confirmed the resilience of small and medium enterprises going into the crisis,” Ermotti says.

Equally impressive was compliance with orders from federal and cantonal authorities, including bans on gatherings of more than five people at a time. “There is a social contract here and a lot of self-responsibility,” Tyler Brûlé, who chose Zurich as the Swiss headquarters of the global Monocle media and advertising business he founded in 2007, said in the Exchange podcast last week. “Social capital is very high here, it’s their way or the highway.”

Indeed, Switzerland’s lockdown severity was relatively consistent. According to the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker’s stringency index, Switzerland on March 17 rose to 79.49 out of 100, and didn’t deviate until April 27 when it relaxed some restrictions. By contrast, the United Kingdom lurched from 24 to 84 and now hovers around 70. Switzerland’s current 63 reading is below that of the United States, Italy and Denmark.

This partly validates the cliché of the prying Swiss neighbour. Before moving to Zurich in late January, multiple people who had lived in the country counselled me not to mix recycling with rubbish and warned that toilets cannot be flushed at certain hours of the day. During peak lockdown, Reuters reported on a surge in noise complaints and private detective inquiries, including on neighbours talking too loudly on late-night conference calls or holding large playdates.

This is a culture that conditions the Swiss to be on their best behaviour in ways that might feel constraining across the border in Italy. But it also means that government can play a less obvious role in enforcing orders. Though the police have broken up some anti-lockdown protests in Zurich, Bern and other cities, they’re not visibly monitoring social distancing.

Citizens appear to take responsibility for following guidelines, as community mobility reports compiled by Google suggest. During the week of May 7, visits to retail and recreation facilities in Zurich were down 54% from the baseline. By comparison, in my native Fairfield County, in Connecticut, the comparative decline was 34%. Where Zurichers excelled was in their visits to parks, up 90% from the baseline. That compared with 68% back home. This is perhaps unsurprising in a country where only around a fifth of adults are obese, compared with 36% of Americans. An ounce of prevention indeed.",real
30,1137,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/the_coronavirus_fifth_column.html,2020-05-16,,"As left-wing Democrat-controlled states continue to keep people in lockdown, it is becoming apparent that they are using the pandemic as a means to gain ultimate control of people's lives.

In fact, leftists the world over are exploiting the pandemic in order to create their alleged utopias. Vanessa Vallejo, a Colombian activist and columnist explains that

Whenever they come to power, communists work hard to create a clientele network that will vote for them and support them in the future. So instead of looking for real solutions to lift people out of poverty altogether, they offer them subsidies or useless jobs where citizens are dependent on politicians. At the same time, they make life difficult for entrepreneurs, resulting in more and more unemployed people who can be hooked into their clientele network. Many of them will not be able to get subsidies, but plunging them into poverty will make them easy prey to convince so long as the government offers them aid and blames right-wing entrepreneurs and politicians for their misery.

Sound familiar? This is happening all across the United States. The governors of states like Michigan, New York, New Jersey, California, and Pennsylvania continue to hold people hostage to their dictatorial impulses.

After all, ""[c]ompanies have been forced to close, people cannot leave their homes so they can not 'seek' income on their own, many are sick or have sick relatives, and in this crisis, they have no way to pay the expenses raised by the calamity. In just a few weeks, government spending and the people who need help have both increased dramatically because people have lost their jobs.""

Eric Levitz at Intelligencer can barely conceal his glee as he writes

Now, the world is besieged by a pandemic that threatens to kill 100,000 Americans if we’re lucky [emphasis mine] before triggering a global economic depression.

He believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has ""expanded the spectrum of imaginable futures and political possibilities. And some of those possibilities have been a sight for sore socialists’ eyes.""

Thus, ""there's good news for progressives"" as they see a golden opportunity to assert that employer-based health care system is inadequate and the market economy which results in ""gross inequality"" must be dismantled. To the Left, the pandemic ""provides a vivid reminder that the state is perfectly capable of sheltering its constituents from the market’s mercilessness [.]"" Enter a ""progressive movement defined by the twin goals of Medicare for All and Green New Deal [that] might thrive in COCI-19's wake."" Leftists assert the need to

mount a robust, progressive response to climate crisis

transcend the nation state

establish ""cross-class and inter-ethnic solidarities""

include the undocumented by providing cash assistance

assist ""stigmatized constituencies"", i.e., people in jail

The ultimate goal for the Left is ""to fortify the progressive project"" by ""cultivat[ing] border-collapsing modes of social identity and secur[ing] a modicum of political power for the world’s disenfranchised and dispossessed.""

At the Jacobin, an American socialist, Marxist quarterly based in New York, Ben Burgis emphasizes that

Progressives and democratic socialists need to make the case that there’s a third alternative to business-as-usual centrists running the states Trump wants to 'liberate' and the cynical demagogues who want to feed low-income workers to the capitalist death machine by prematurely ending the lockouts [emphasis mine].

Consequently, he emphasizes that ""the pandemic can be an opportunity for the Left if [they're] prepared to fight for bold measures.""

In fact, the ""Democratic Socialists of America have an estimated 10,000 new members -- growth that organizers attribute, in part, to the coronavirus pandemic."" Since ""[t]he financial toll will be felt for years -- maybe decades -- to come, and with Congress’s push to expand the social safety net, more and more Americans could be open to government playing a bigger role in their lives. There is, in other words, great potential for systemic change in this as-yet-unwritten future -- a potential that [Democratic Socialists of America DSA] members recognize.""

Madeline Osburn reports that ""[a] network of Democratic non-profits and super PACs are funneling millions of dollars toward advertisements in key swing states, with the intent of politicizing the Wuhan coronavirus crisis and blaming the pandemic on President Donald Trump.""

The Washington Post reported the group Pacronym is planning to spend $5 million on ads attacking Trump’s response to the pandemic. Pacronym, whose board of directors includes former Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, said its ads will target key 2020 swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Arizona.

Money is distributed to progressive causes by a number of Democratic PACs, e.g., Sixteen Thirty Fund. In fact, ""in 2018, Politico reported that the Sixteen Thirty Fund 'funneled millions of dollars to progressive causes' by setting up a secret-money network of other groups, which were the 'most prolific political advertisers of 2018' when combined.""

Trevor Loudon has documented how ""communists and socialists are infiltrating the Democrat Party -- some openly, some secretly and some even running for public office on the Democratic Party ballot line."" In reality, ""politicizing the growing fears, illnesses and deaths of American citizens"" is a potent weapon in the Leftwing arsenal.

And, yet, as Vanessa Vallejo states, ""What is happening in the United States is a novelty that, once again, shows us how strong and important are the values and ideas on which this great country was built. In different parts of the U.S., there have been protests, including armed ones. Also, in different parts of the U.S., police have declared that they will not comply with orders to keep people completely confined by preventing activities that do not represent any danger and are necessary for the survival of many people.""

The declarations that we are seeing in the United States these days on this matter are shocking to those of us who come from countries where people have simply become accustomed to obeying any nonsense spouted by the ruler of the day. To see a policeman telling the media that he will always 'put constitutional rights before political opinions' and that therefore, he will not abide by draconian measures that go against common sense is encouraging for those of us who defend freedom. The coronavirus has cleared the field for communists. It is an opportune moment for the left in general, but above all, for those who already wield a certain amount of power and want to perpetuate themselves and implant their totalitarian paradise once and for all.

Freedom-loving Americans need to understand the existence of this fifth column and then assiduously fight the penetration of enemies to the state.

The hundreds of inmates of La Esperanza prison in central Honduras must leave its small courtyard and file back to their cramped cells.

Throughout the night, packed into a room with 130 other men, Estrada hears his neighbors' muffled whimpering as rats scuttle by.

""That is when the hell really begins,"" said the powerfully built and bearded 25-year-old, glancing a final time at the armed guards perched on the rooftop, silhouetted against the dimming sky.

""The best way to get out unscathed, is to keep your head down,"" said Estrada, quiet and composed.

Behind the bars, the ultimate law is that which reigns in Central America, a mantra sprayed onto walls in gang-controlled neighborhoods: ver, oír, y callar. See, hear, and shut up.

Estrada is serving his fourth year of a six-year sentence for marijuana possession in La Esperanza, a low-security prison tucked into the pine and oak-lined mountains of central Honduras. Its name, in Spanish, means hope.

The roots of the problems at La Esperanza plague prisons throughout Latin America, said director Jose López Cerrato: harsh sentences for small crimes, lack of proper police investigation, and many detainees held without charge, often for years.

A whiteboard at the entrance keeps a daily tally. The top line never changes: ""Prison Capacity: 70 inmates."" But the rows below of the actual number of prisoners tick up and down. Today's count: 454.

Gerson Ramos, 24, waits for prison guards to fill out some paperwork before being released.

But as the coronavirus took hold in Honduras, authorities banned visits. And with prohibitively expensive rates for calls from the prison's three working phones, inmates are now all but cut off from the outside world.

The only reprieve is visiting days, when children, grandparents and wives breathe life into the courtyard, taking over the kitchen, playing ball, and praying with the inmates at religious services.

""Taking away visits is the worst thing that can happen. It's what they need most because, more than anything, it gives them hope,"" says Jacinto Hernández, La Esperanza's psychologist. ""I fear it could turn violent as the virus spreads and anxieties increase. Aggressions already run high; they barely have room to breathe.""

In addition to the health risks posed by overcrowding, staff worry about the pandemic's mental toll.

An inmate, who said he was having respiratory issues, is checked by medical practitioner Blenda Paredes inside the prison.

So far, the country's 29 prisons have largely been spared, but should the virus spread inside the crumbling system, the results could be devastating. Honduras' prisons, designed for just over 10,000 inmates, are home to nearly 22,000, according to recent counts.

Honduras has had over 2,000 reported coronavirus cases and 120 deaths, although most public health experts say those numbers are a likely underestimate.

Hernández estimates about one fifth of the male population already leaves with post-traumatic stress disorder they did not have when they arrived.

Water is only available a couple of times a week and, with just one shared bathroom, men bathe in the courtyard with cold water from buckets used to wash the clothes they drape overhead. Respiratory illness are common, the product of sleeping on the ground exposed to the cold mountain air.

Built in 1937, La Esperanza's imposing colonial-style blue and yellow structure sits across from the town's main square, where young lovers steal furtive kisses on park benches.

Inmates line up with buckets as they wait to collect water for bathing and washing clothes from a large concrete storage container in the prison courtyard.

Before the coronavirus, family visitors would sell goods the men had made - hammocks, fishing nets, toy cars - to raise money for soap, coffee and cigarettes. They brought empanadas, fried chicken, and tamales as a relief from the meager prison diet staples of rice and beans.

Most days the men make crafts, lift makeshift weights, or play cards to keep them occupied.

""It's complicated to breathe, but summer is true hell and you can feel everyone's bodies,"" said Erlin Mendez, 27, who shares his 38-inch wide space with another inmate, who he says is in for murder after an alcohol-fueled machete fight.

Intibucá, where La Esperanza Prison is located, is one of Honduras' poorest areas. Illiteracy is high; alcoholism pervasive. The most common crimes are domestic violence, drug possession and homicide.

Each of the windowless rooms is a dark labyrinth of improvised wood-and-plywood beds, with limbs protruding at every turn.

Inmates lucky enough to have beds, and especially beds with curtains, would rent them out to prisoners with female visitors. ""These visits definitely keep tensions lower,"" said Israel Miranda, 36.

Catalino Rodriguez, 50, and Santos Primitivo, 23, lie in their sleeping quarters inside an over-crowded cell that they share with several other inmates.

Story

Another part of the prison holds female inmates.

Under a rusty tin roof in an attached building, the women are sectioned off behind a chain link fence. ""It's like being in a really depressing zoo,"" said Elian Martinez, a 39-year-old mother of three who says she was wrongfully accused of fraud.

The one cell for six women has four beds and space for three people to stand. They get three hours of sunlight a week at an adjacent guard tower.

In the men's section, 132 men sleep in a room with fewer than 50 beds. Newer inmates sleep wherever they can find a patch, often sharing the floor with cockroaches and rats. The wait for a bed is around three years.

""You never get used to it, just resigned,"" Estrada said. ""Each day you wake up at 5 AM, wait in line for water and food, survive, and it means one day fewer, one day closer to family.""",real

Less than three months later, that type of mass clamoring is strictly forbidden as social distancing measures have been put in place to quell the spread of the novel coronavirus. In the uncertain age of COVID-19, when news and information travels almost as fast as the virus itself, Jan. 1 likely seems like a lifetime ago to many cannabis users.

Unlike thousands of businesses, however, pot stores have been able to keep their doors open under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s statewide stay-at-home order, which labeled all dispensaries and cultivation centers “essential businesses.” The decision to allow the high times to keep rolling amid the rising public health crisis is an acknowledgment that, for many Illinoisans, buying weed is as vital as doing laundry or grocery shopping.

“People all over the nation are running to cannabis right now,” said Margo Vesely, executive of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the country’s oldest weed advocacy group.

“People are selling out just like we are selling out of necessities, just like toilet paper and bread. A lot of people are dependent on it,” added Vesely, who noted that alcohol sales are also still allowed.

Similar to ibuprofen

As similar stay-at-home directives are being issued in states across the country, many have deemed marijuana businesses essential. In Massachusetts, medical sales are allowed to continue but recreational operations were forced to shut down on Monday — a move pot advocates said was short-sighted.

Vesely argued that it’s important for people who use the drug for health and wellness purposes to continue to have access to recreational pot. That’s because many of them simply can’t afford to pay for a doctor’s visit to get a prescription or the $100 registration fee for a medical license.

Meanwhile, Kris Krane, president of the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, likened recreational cannabis to over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen.

“Saying we can’t be open for adult-use but we can only be open for medical would be akin to saying that CVS can only sell prescription medication,” Krane said.

On top of that, Krane noted, many people in Illinois simply need “stress relief in a time like this.”

“People might snicker about it, but it’s incredibly important,” said Krane. “People need some way to chill out, to unwind.”

Political sea change

While recreational weed is now considered essential in Illinois, it was still illegal just three months ago. The about-face can largely be attributed to Pritzker, who ran on a platform to end Illinois’ pot prohibition and made good on the promise.

Months before Pritzker announced his candidacy in 2017, his Republican predecessor Bruce Rauner came out strongly against the legalization of recreational marijuana, which he said would be a “mistake.”

Throughout his single term as governor, Rauner resisted multiple efforts to expand the medical program — though he also signed a bill that decriminalized pot in 2016. When he struck a deal with lawmakers that same year to extend the medical program for three years and add two qualifying conditions, he forced the Medical Cannabis Advisory Board to disband, Chicago Magazine reported.

The Chicago Democrats who led the legalization push, state Rep. Kelly Cassidy and state Sen. Heather Steans, first introduced legislation to legalize recreational weed the following year, but their identical bills didn’t gain much traction in either house of the General Assembly.

By the end of Rauner’s tenure, he signed off on an expansion to the program by establishing the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, which gives people prescribed opioids access to medical weed. But even when he signed that bill, Rauner said he was “very much opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana.”

After unseating Rauner in the 2018 election, Pritzker championed new legislation introduced by Steans, Cassidy and other pro-pot lawmakers that sought to make the state’s nascent cannabis industry an inclusive engine for social change. In June, just over six months after taking office, he fully legalized weed statewide with the stroke of a pen.

For Krane, who has worked in the cannabis world for decades, Pritzker’s latest move to deem pot businesses as essential — which drew virtually no public opposition — is “a sign of how far we’ve come on this issue.”",real

It was March 12, and she had returned home to New York the night before from a meeting with the NWSL’s staff in Chicago. Baird checked Twitter before going to bed, like so many do, but this time her timeline read nothing like a typical social-media feed.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver had just announced the season would be postponed after Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus.

Baird spent the next morning contemplating taking public transportation to a meeting with league sponsor Budweiser. She opted to drive instead and headed out for what unknowingly would be her last day working from anywhere but home.

“We had a great meeting with Budweiser,” Baird said. “I don’t think any of us had any idea [what was coming]. I went home, and, literally, your email and Twitter feed start filling. You’re rapidly and in real time assessing the situation. It was like watching the dominoes fall.”

Baird acted swiftly and announced the postponement of the NWSL’s preseason on March 13, and within a week, the season was postponed indefinitely.

Right now, the league is planning for the final weekend in June as a target start date.

Red Stars owner Arnim Whisler added that the league hopes to get 16 to 20 games in this season and that the NWSL hopes to become the first professional sports league to return to play. The Red Stars’ target start date to resume the preseason is May 5, but Whisler said that could change.

The NWSL caters to a much smaller fan base than any other pro sports league. The teams’ stadiums are more modest, and for the Red Stars, there is even the potential to seat fans further apart from one another at SeatGeek Stadium.

“There are some silver linings,” Whisler said. “We’re smaller. We’re more nimble. We only have nine teams that we have to plan around. So our goal is to be the first ones playing again. It’s easy for us to pull off because we aren’t used to 40,000-plus crowds.”

The NWSL was carrying the momentum from the U.S. women’s national team’s fourth World Cup title, a freshly signed TV contract with CBS and a promising sponsorship deal with Budweiser into its eighth season.

The league’s average attendance was 7,383 last season, and Baird’s primary goal as commissioner is to continue to build off that 22.6% increase from 2018. She believes the anticipation for the 2020 Olympic Games — which have been postponed to 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic — will help that cause.

“The global landscape for women’s soccer never rests,” Baird said. “What I need to do as a spokesperson for the league is continue to point to how exciting the future is for women’s soccer. That’s the key.”

The league as a whole hasn’t lost any sponsors, and Whisler said the Red Stars have maintained all of their sponsorship deals since the postponement of the season was announced.

Whisler has not laid off or furloughed any front-office employees, and the organization has applied for some of the federal loans available to keep his workforce together.

Still, uncertainty remains surrounding the TV deal with CBS.

CBS was set to air two games, the season opener April 18 between the Washington Spirit and OL Reign and the league championship game. CBS Sports Network would air another 14 games, and 71 more would’ve been on CBS All Access, the network’s subscription streaming service. But now there are no guarantees because of the overlap that’s likely to occur with other leagues.

“CBS and all sports programming has been pulled down,” Whisler said. “So all the windows are wide open right now. If we can return quickly, there is a lot of airtime to fill. Twitch will have us whenever we’re ready. CBS, depending on when things turn back on, will have to rethink some of the TV windows.”",real
47,739,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-workers-with-coronavirus-60-minutes-2020-05-10/,2020-05-10,Amazon worker: At least 600 Amazon employees stricken by coronavirus,"Amazon, Inc. is the second largest private employer in the United States and recently announced it hired an additional 175,000 people to assist with increased customer demand during the coronavirus pandemic.

The company has more than 150 million paid Prime subscribers worldwide, many of whom have come to rely on the delivery service and its essential workers amidst stay-at-home orders around the globe.

This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl reports on how Amazon is protecting its workforce during the coronavirus pandemic.

""I think we've been early on the curve to this than most employers, particularly major employers in the U.S.,"" Amazon's head of operations, Dave Clark, told Stahl.

As part of the company's last earnings report, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledged at least $4 billion for COVID-related expenses. The company says it has already invested more than $800 million on safety measures.

The safeguards include experimenting with self-administered COVID-19 testing capabilities, mandating temperature checks, and distributing portable handwashing stations.

The corporation's focus on worker safety comes as some Amazon employees have staged protests, walk-outs, and sick-outs. Their demands include better sanitation of facilities, hazard pay and more generous sick leave.

Amazon says any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or is presumed positive is eligible to receive up to two weeks of paid time off.

Until May 1, the company had offered unlimited, unpaid time off for its employees who were concerned about their safety during the pandemic. Amazon also increased its current minimum wage from $15 to $17 through May 16.

Jana Jumpp, a 59-year-old Amazon employee who works at a warehouse in Indiana, told 60 Minutes she took advantage of the stay-at-home benefit because she feared for her health.

""I was a little uncomfortable…the cases were starting in Washington and it didn't seem like anybody had a plan, even Amazon,"" Jumpp told 60 Minutes. ""So my only option at that point was to take a leave of absence.""

Jumpp says she began working for Amazon more than four years ago. She has not gone to work in at least two months, taking advantage of the extended unpaid leave policy.

While at home, on her own initiative, Jumpp is tracking the number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for COVID-19 at locations throughout the nation. She gathers her data by connecting with coworkers across the country and collecting the automated text messages and robocalls Amazon sends its employees when someone tests positive at one of its facilities.

An automated text received from Amazon by an employee

""I can tell you right now, and the number is higher than this, but we have at least 600 [cases],"" Jumpp said to Stahl. Jumpp says six Amazon employees have died from COVID-19.

Amazon would not confirm Jumpp's number and says it is not the most important way to quantify the problem. ""The actual…total number of cases isn't particularly useful because it's relative to the size of the building and then the overall community infection rate,"" Clark told 60 Minutes.

Amazon says its automated notification system informs all employees when there is a new confirmed case of COVID-19 at the facility they work at, some of which are the size of multiple football fields. The company does not specify the department or shift the positive employee worked on in these messages. Amazon says it does direct employees who work in proximity of those who have tested positive to enter quarantine, with pay.

Amazon employees who do not meet the stay-at-home criteria now must decide if and when they return to work.

""If there's no reason not to be at work and you choose to stay home...you'd have to use your unpaid time off or [use] your other paid time off options in order to remain at home,"" said Amazon's Dave Clark. ""And if you run out of all those options you would need to come back to work or yes, it would result in separation from [the] company.""

DRUGS INCREASE ACE2 THAT IS NEEDED BY SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Coronavirus) TO ATTACH AND INFECT CELLS of the lung, intestine, kidney, blood vessel. The more ACE2, the more infection. This may be the reason why the elderly who are treated with these drugs, have a greater risk of death / severe side effects.

A joint opinion statement about this topic was issued on March 17, 2020 by the American College Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Heart Failure Society of America:

""The continued highest standard of care for cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is top priority, but there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients using ACE-I or ARB medications,"" said Richard J. Kovacs, MD, FACC. ""We urge urgent, additional research that can guide us to optimal care for the millions of people worldwide with cardiovascular disease and who may contract COVID-19. These recommendations will be adjusted as needed to correspond with the latest research.""

“In the event patients with cardiovascular disease are diagnosed with COVID-19, individualized treatment decisions should be made according to each patient's hemodynamic status and clinical presentation.""

Dr Simone's Recommendation March 18, 2020:

Speak with your prescribing physician about this to determine what is best for you.

We should always decrease risk while maintaining good blood pressure and diabetes control. Diabetes (34 million Americans) and certain medicines (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ibuprofen, thiazolidinediones) taken by tens of millions of Americans increase the ACE2 receptors that allow the virus to attach and infect cells. Once these patients are infected, it may be too late. Therefore, physicians should consider modifying these medications or substituting them with calcium channel blockers or other diabetes medicines to maintain good blood pressure control and blood glucose control for a temporary period of time until the pandemic wanes.

Originally published on www.childrenshealthdefense.org

From the moment of ""COVID-19's"" naming--and particularly since the imposition of unprecedented restrictions on ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness""--some people have smelled a rat. And with each passing week, the smell becomes worse. A growing chorus of ordinary citizens and world-renowned medical and scientific experts is raising questions about matters ranging from the coronavirus's origins to the rationale for continued lockdowns (see here, here and here).

The mainstream media have shown themselves only too ready to lob ad hominem attacks against any and all such non-conformists. However, one does not have to be insensitive to the illness and deaths associated with COVID-19 to recognize that powerful agendas are riding on the coattails of SARS-CoV-2. Citizens are waking up to the fact that the countries, officials and public figures who embrace draconian interventions such as immunity certificates, microchipping, forced vaccination and the removal of children from their homes also approve of making our sovereign rights--whether to earn a living, maintain bodily integrity, congregate to practice our spirituality, enjoy the arts or protect and educate our children--contingent upon our acceptance of these Big Brother measures and technologies.

To make it easier for the public to assess what is happening and what is at stake, Children's Health Defense has put together the following timeline of selected events. We invite readers to consider how these events--some of them seemingly unrelated--and the network of partnerships and relationships that they illustrate have contributed to the unfolding set of circumstances in which we now find ourselves.

Notes/Explanatory Context

Gain-of-function research: COVID-19 has prompted renewed questioning about a long-debated branch of virology that, around 2012, scientists benignly rebranded as ""gain-of-function"" (GOF) research. GOF experiments seek to generate viruses ""with properties that do not exist in nature"" or, stated another way, ""alter a pathogen to make it more transmissible or deadly."" One of the leading proponents of GOF work is Dr. Ralph Baric at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC), a ""legend in coronavirology"" and ""trailblazer of synthetic genomic manipulation techniques"" who specializes in engineering lethal coronaviruses from ""mail-order DNA."" Baric and other GOF enthusiasts argue that this type of viral tinkering is ""critical to the development of broad-based vaccines and therapeutics,"" but critics, such as Dr. Thomas Inglesby (director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security), dispute this putative benefit.

Big Data and Big Telecom: Children's Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna Tachover (director of CHD's ""Stop 5G and Wireless Harms Project"") wrote on May 8: ""5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it's all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence purposes. The 21st century's 'black gold' is data."" They note that Bill Gates, along with a number of other players and companies, is helping set up a ""microwave radiation-emitting spider web [that] will allow Big Data/Big Telecom and Big Brother to capture what happens inside and outside every person at every moment of life"" using a sinister brain-machine interface and other technologies, many financed by Gates. In short, ""While the lockdown is a cataclysm for the world economy, it is an opportunity for Gates"" and his billionaire brotherhood, ably assisted by an unadmirable fleet of medical and scientist yes-men.

(Writing in 2020, a scientist states, ""The speed of the Baric group illustrates how quickly a qualified team of virologists can create a synthetic clone from a natural virus, and therefore make genetic modifications to it. Moreover, that was back in 2003. Today, a qualified laboratory can repeat those steps in a matter of weeks."")

2005

December: Congress approves the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, which authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ""to issue a PREP Act Declaration . . . that provides immunity from liability for any loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to diseases, threats, and conditions determined in the Declaration to constitute a present or credible risk of a future public health emergency.""

2009

October 7: National Institutes of Health (NIH) director Francis Collins announces a ""new phase of cooperation"" between NIH and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, including partnering for vaccine development.

October 17: Under President Obama, the NIH halts federal funding for gain-of-function (GOF) research (see Notes) and asks federally funded GOF researchers to ""agree to a voluntary moratorium."" The funding hiatus applies to 21 studies ""reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route."" NIH later allows 10 of the studies to resume.

2015

2015: NIAID, under Fauci, awards a five-year, $3.7 million grant to EcoHealth Alliance (whose director gets credit on subsequent publications for ""funding acquisition"" rather than scientific work) to conduct gain-of-function studies on the ""risk of bat coronavirus emergence.""

September 24: UNC's Ralph Baric is granted a patent for the creation of chimeric coronavirus spike proteins.

November 9: Baric and the Wuhan Institute's Shi Zheng-Li (the leading GOF coronavirus researcher in China) publish what some refer to as ""the most famous gain-of-function virology paper"" (in Nature Medicine), describing their creation of a synthetic chimeric coronavirus. The authors state: ""[T]hese data and restrictions represent a crossroads of GOF research concerns; the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens [emphasis added]. In developing policies moving forward, it is important to consider the value of the data generated by these studies and whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved.""

2016

2016: The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity states that ""very few government-funded gain-of-function experiments [pose] a significant threat to public health.""

2017

February 8: The Modi administration in India severs ties with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, after researchers blame the Gates-funded polio vaccination campaign for almost half a million cases of childhood paralysis.

November 30: Shi Zheng-Li and coauthors publish a paper in PLoS Pathogens describing the creation of eight new synthetic coronaviruses.

December 19: Dr. Marc Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health tells the New York Times that the type of gain-of-function experiments endorsed by Dr. Fauci's NIAID have ""done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemics, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.""

2019

2019: NIAID awards a six-year renewal grant of $3.7 million to EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology to continue their gain-of-function studies on bat coronaviruses. The renewal is approved ""unusually quickly,"" receiving a ""really extremely high priority for funding.""

August 14: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) records show that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation owns 5.3 million shares of Crown Castle International Corp., representing the Foundation's second largest tech holding after Microsoft. Crown Castle dominates ownership of 5G infrastructure throughout the U.S., including cell towers, small cell nodes and fiber.

October: A report released by NBC News in May, 2020 declares, ""The analysis of commercial telemetry data in Wuhan suggests the COVID-19 pandemic began earlier than initially reported"" and ""supports the release of COVID-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."" NBC's May 8 summary states, ""there was no cellphone activity in a high-security portion of the Wuhan Institute of Virology from Oct. 7 through Oct. 24, 2019, and that there may have been a 'hazardous event' sometime between Oct. 6 and Oct. 11.""

October 6: On May 5, 2020, British and French researchers publish a study estimating that COVID-19 could have started as early as October 6, 2019.

Stop the conveyor belt

Around the world, many people are understandably reeling in shock at the rapid economic, social and cultural changes that have followed in the wake of the phenomenon called ""COVID-19."" Many of these changes involve ever-tighter restrictions on our rights and freedoms, accompanied by inexorable messaging--both public and subliminal--that a ""vaccine for all"" and 24/7 tracking and surveillance are the only way out. Increasingly, however, there are hopeful signs that more members of the public are recognizing the duplicity and self-interest of those offering false salvation. Each of us needs to do our part to expose these issues, standing up for individual sovereignty and working to halt the transition ""to a totalitarian singularity more despotic than Orwell ever imagined.""",fake
66,606,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/digital-campaign-organization-coronavirus/,2020-05-05,Campaign organizing involves personal connections. Digital teams are trying to adapt amid coronavirus,"Six months out from the general election, the coronavirus continues to impact voters across the country regardless of party affiliation. Safety precautions forced Democratic and Republican organizers to rapidly transition operations to 100% virtual and, in some cases, in a matter of days.

Social distancing measures that have been implemented in response to the pandemic could delay a return to traditional political organizing for the foreseeable future or change them forever. As a result, the Democratic and Republican National Committees, various state parties, and political training organizations have been forced to rely on digital platforms to engage voters in more creative ways.

Party leaders and digital directors told CBS News they have had to adjust in different ways to digital organizing, including teaching volunteers how to use phone banking apps via Zoom, using the same platform to onboard and train volunteers, and hosting digital one-on-one coffee meet-ups between organizers and voters.

NDTC training

According to the RNC, in the weeks since they've gone fully virtual in their operation, they have held nearly 3,900 Trump Victory Leadership Initiative training sessions and more than 1,700 MAGA meet-ups. The committee also noted that they've made more than 20 million voter contacts and have added more than 300,000 new volunteers to their team since making the virtual transition.

""Modern campaigns are all done with digital and through apps,"" said RNC and Trump Victory spokesperson Rick Gorka, who added that being able to phone bank from home creates flexibility for volunteers. ""For us, it's just that that virtual campaign has been a part of what we've done throughout this [and] since the 2016 cycle.""

At the same time, the DNC digital unit has worked to help different departments move online and at the beginning of April, the committee announced in a memo that there had been nearly 7,000 individuals trained on digital organizing tools in the span of a few weeks through the committee's Digital Organizing 101 training sessions. Through partnerships with state parties in battleground states like Florida and Georgia, the committee has sent 2.8 million text messages to voters encouraging them to vote by mail. And the DNC has embedded 11 digital organizing fellows in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""Organizing at its core is just relationship-building. I think digital organizing is like that as well. How connected does a supporter feel to us and how much of the party do they feel like is their own,"" said DNC Digital Organizing director Meg DiMartino. ""The thing I think about often is how do we continue to deepen and build that online …what are more ways that our supporters, our volunteers can feel more ownership over this program.""

NDTC training

Democrats only recently wrapped up a historically crowded presidential primary, with more than two dozen candidates vying for the nomination. After Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee in April, the Democratic Party immediately announced it would be using its resources to help his campaign scale up quickly. This came as the Biden campaign also had to shift all campaign efforts online. Organizing teams have remained engaged using Zoom to host action events like writing letters and creating signs for first responders. The campaign has also held community calls to check in with how volunteers and supporters are doing during the pandemic.

CBS News attended virtual training sessions with the DNC, RNC, and National Democratic Training Committee, to observe how the campaigns are engaging with voters behind closed doors. Training sessions with as many as 300 participants allowed people to tune in from home offices, living rooms, kitchens or even bedrooms. Volunteers of all ages intently stared at computer screens as hosts drilled down using PowerPoint presentations that lasted 10 to 45 minutes. One of the training sessions featured voters from at least seven different states, another had a steady stream of questions from participants that would show up as blinking notifications in the ""Comments"" section. After presentations, participants were sent handouts, and in some cases, had the opportunity to practice their newly-acquired skills with the trainer on the line.

""These virtual trainings are so easy. And you're actually able to do a lot more of them because you're not traveling from location to location,"" said Florida Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters, who gave remarks during a recent RNC virtual training. ""It's the exact same thing that you would do whether you see them in person, or you could do it over the phone because it's all about getting people set up on the system that they could use in their own homes to make those calls.""

ON THE GROUND FROM COAST TO COAST

Officials from both parties and training organizations insist that digital migration has been made easier because they were already in the process of putting infrastructure in place. CBS News spoke with a dozen Democratic and Republican state parties to survey how the shift to digital has impacted their operations.

""With all the technology that's available…we've done an incredible amount of voter contacts,"" Gruters said. He added that his team has made 4.5 million calls since going fully digital. ""We're hitting all of our numbers and the great thing about what we're able to do is when people are at home because of this crisis, you essentially have a captive audience.""

""One thing that's really interesting is, switching to virtual has actually allowed the team to connect more with rural voters,"" said Iowa Republican Party Communications Director Aaron Britt. He pointed out that rural voters helped President Trump win in 2016, saying ""that's been one of the great offsets especially here in Iowa, the uptick that we've seen in being able to connect with those rural voters as we make a lot of phone calls and things like that.""

Colorado Republican Party Communications director Joe Jackson noted that in his state, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work in both rural and urban areas, so they transitioned events starting at the county party level. When they did their caucuses and assembly, decisions were made at the local level within the governor's guidelines, leaving some counties to conduct drive-through caucuses while others did Zoom meetings or emails.

For Democrats, multiple state parties are trying to maintain high voter engagement. In many states where there was record voter turnout in primaries before the coronavirus pandemic, people have since been forced to shelter in place.

In late April, the North Carolina Democratic Party had record turnout during its county conventions, which were held virtually using Zoom for the first time. Normally, the conventions would have used a county-by-county approach, but because of the pandemic, the party centralized training and coordination to ensure the conventions ran smoothly. Officials and campaigns have also been using texting, phone banking, and holding virtual events and organizing communities online.

""Notwithstanding the challenge, I believe we are more organized and more focused than ever before,"" said NCDP Chair Wayne Goodwin. ""We had no choice but to do that.""

The Michigan Democratic party said it recruited more than 3,000 volunteers and made more than 60,000 direct voter contact calls in the first month of distancing. The party has continued to interview and train organizers, with a goal of having 70 in the state by the end of May. The Organizing Corps program, which trains college students, will be hosting a virtual bootcamp to train a third wave of organizers in the next few weeks for organizing in Michigan.

""We continue to grow this ground game,"" said MDP Chair Lavora Barnes. The 2020 organizing efforts have been underway since 2017. ""It's currently virtual organizers and a lot of these tools that we're using now, we'll continue to use even if or when we're able to get back out and knock on doors and stand on folks' porches and have conversations with them.""

Florida Democratic Party executive director Juan Peñalosa said they've already begun to implement contingency plans if the party has to continue digital organizing through November.

""I think now more than ever, when people vote in November, they're going to think about who helped them, who was there for them during this pandemic, through this crisis. And we've inserted that question into every aspect of our organizing program,"" said Peñalosa. ""Voters today are worried about their health, their jobs, home schooling, their kids. They're lonely and frustrated and good campaigns meet people where they are and our campaign is focused on meeting people where they are. So all of our outreach begins with a wellness check.""

In late March, the Texas Democratic Party launched a series of new programs. Those programs include an online community hub called ConnectTexas, a network of check-in calls across every county called Connect254 and a Community Captains program that has already recruited nearly 500 people. In a state without online voter registration, the party also launched a website in late April to facilitate getting registration forms and postage into the hands of new voters.

Before the pandemic crippled the country, the Texas Democratic Party told CBS News it was planning to put up to 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground in the state as part of their effort to turn Texas from red to blue. At the time, more than 2 million voters participated in the state's Democratic presidential primary, and the party said its organizing operation would be the biggest in the state party's and perhaps Texas history. CBS News learned in a followup last week that the goal has not changed — it's just significantly shifted online.

""That's what organizing and campaigning are, you have to be willing to pivot, but you want to be clear, what we're doing now is aligned with what we planned to do which is building relationships, building connections,"" said Texas Democratic Party organizing director Olivia Stitilis.

DIGITAL GROWING PAINS

While field operations across the country have jumped into online organizing head on, the reliance on technology has not been without adjustments. In South Carolina, the state Democratic Party has worked with counties to hold virtual conventions for the past month. And original plans to hire a significant field staff have changed for the time being.

""We're analyzing the way we're going to have our state convention, we're doing our executive committee meetings completely differently…so there's been a completely re-organization as to how you organize, but also how you go about doing the perfunctory business of running the state party,"" said SCDP Chairman Trav Robertson. ""There's a portion of it that you anticipate doing as everything goes to a digital type of platform or campaign but I mean, the majority of this is a result of COVID-19.""

Training organizations like the National Democratic Training Committee and the conservative Leadership Institute have added online courses to help down ballot candidates and people who are interested in public policy to navigate campaigns and voter engagement during the pandemic.

""Campaigns are naturally risk-averse and late adopters of technology...for a variety of reasons,"" said National Democratic Training Committee CEO Kelly Deitrich. ""[Texting] is not normally a technology that down ballot campaigns with limited time, money and people invest in. They're out knocking on doors. Well, they don't have that option anymore. They're forced to adopt these new ways of communicating and reaching voters that wouldn't have been their first choice, but now may be their only choice.""

""I wouldn't say the goals have changed, I would say the relevant topics have changed,"" said Ron Nehring, who has worked at the Leadership Institute for five years. ""We're still teaching political technology but we're teaching in subjects that we haven't had to cover before. We've never had to do a program on 'how do you keep your campaign alive during a pandemic.""",real

Ernesto was not a healthy boy, to be sure.

Since age 6, he had suffered the effects of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic nerve condition that weakens muscles, usually of the lower extremities but sometimes respiratory muscles as well.

Opinion

Ernesto used a wheelchair or a walker and the help of his mother each morning to get out to the street in the front of their Gage Park bungalow to catch a van that until recently took him to Marquez Elementary, an ACERO charter school.

Ernesto also suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.

But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.

Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.

None of those individuals were younger than Ernesto. Previously, the youngest known victim was a 19-year-old man from Riverdale, who died April 10.

Early in the pandemic, state officials announced the death of a 9-month-old infant that they attributed to COVID, but that death remains under investigation by the Cook County Medical Examiner and has never been officially determined to be caused by the virus.

Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously?

I doubt it.

Even now, I know someone is reading this and saying “but children die all the time,” and that is true. Children die all the time, and I realize more of them have died of something other than COVID-19 in the two months we’ve been in lockdown.

Still, what if he’s just the first child to die as the disease continues to spread, indeed if it accelerates as we accommodate the desires of those who want to visit their favorite bars and restaurants, or more to the point, the more understandable desire for the owners of those businesses to try to make money again?

There are other vulnerable children. Do we sacrifice them for the sake of the economy, knowing that the financial crisis will take its own toll?

I don’t know the answer to that. Personally, I wouldn’t want to take the risk just yet, but it’s easy for me to say, my family still secure and everyone drawing a paycheck.

Sometime in the last two months, Ernesto’s family moved from the Gage Park home to Indiana, neighbors said. A “For Rent” sign hung Thursday in the window.

In fact, the neighbors did not know Ernesto’s name, not even the children who lived across the street, because Ernesto did not come out and play with the other children, apparently because of his health.

A GoFundMe page that was opened Thursday to support his family showed Ernesto in a white suit at church. First communion maybe? Sorry, I don’t know my religious rituals. But I see a sweet boy.

Officials from Marquez Elementary issued a statement saying they were heartbroken to learn of his death.

“Ernesto was a cherished member of the Marquez community joining our family in Kindergarten through most of his sixth-grade year. Although he and his family recently relocated, he was still one of our Marshals and kept in close touch with his Marquez friends and teachers. He was a special member of our school community.”

“Ernesto loved Fortnite, art projects, science experiments, jokes and riddles, spending time with friends, and is remembered for being an incredibly sweet and loving confidant to everyone he met. We love Ernesto and will miss him with our whole heart.”

I reached a family member by phone. Through her tears, she said she did not speak English.

The man who came on the line next said politely: “We have no comment at this time.”

I’ll have to let their GoFundMe page do the talking.

Since his first surgery for Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Ernesto “has been fighting for his life with his strong spirit,” it states.

“While he may have been taken from us at such a young age, we will never forget the importance of unity and family he valued so much. He was constantly surrounded by love and happiness, and we know he’s made an impact on anyone he’s met.”

Take this seriously, folks. Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.",real
72,27,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/americas-first-case-community-spread-coronavirus/,2020-02-27,America’s First Case Of Community Spread Coronavirus,"An American with no history of travel to outbreak hotspots or exposure to another person that is infected with the coronavirus has been diagnosed with the disease, according to the CDC announcement this is very likely the first case of community spread inside of the United States.

According to the announcement the patient was admitted to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California on February 19, 2020 from another hospital, but the patient was not diagnosed until 4 days later. The hospital called in the CDC to do the testing because they are not capable of doing so which is what caused the delay.

The hospital released a statement saying that the patient was placed under “strict contact precautions” and believed there “has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.” Additionally some of the hospital staff have been asked to stay home and monitor their condition/temperature as an added measure of precaution.

There are over 60 confirmed American cases of the coronavirus, 43 of whom were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The coronavirus is known to be highly contagious, but it is not fully understood how it passes from person to person. This first incidence of reported American community spread serves to reveal gaps in the testing capability in the United States which could very well hamper efforts to slow the spread of the virus.

As it stands only the CDC and a few local public health agencies have the ability to administer testing. The current administration recently announced that the Vice President will be leading domestic efforts to combat the disease, and the administration has requested $1.25 million in emergency funding for the effort from Congress, along with $1.25 billion in funding to be diverted from other federal programs; additionally the White House budget office will be moving $535 million which was allocated for the prevention and treatment of the Ebola virus towards this.

“We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen.”

For those hoping for a vaccine, keep in mind that even at rocket speed releasing any such vaccine would take at least a year at minimum to pass through development to animal testing, to initial human trials, and then the approval process. Some small initial human trials have begun involving a handful of subjects, and others are set to launch within a month, this will need to be expanded from the small numbers to include hundreds if not thousands of subjects in countries with active disease transmissions which could take another 6-8 months.

Over 27,000 people are listed as recovered from the coronavirus in China, these people may have blood supplies swarming with antibodies against the virus. Shanghai doctors have been collecting blood plasma from survivors to infuse into those who are infected, while this is not guaranteed to work it can sometimes be life saving. Shanghai doctors have also been using several medications (lopinavir, ritonavir, and Descovy) that are approved for HIV to those in severe respiratory distress. Scientists in China are also testing the antimalarial drug chloroquine, although not confirmed some reports are suggesting positive progress in patients receiving 400mg daily for 5 days.

Virus blockers such as the broad spectrum experimental remdesivir is a good prospect as it is active against viruses with genetic material made of RNA, it worked well in animals infected with MERS, but didn’t help much with Ebola. A study will be launched investigated remdesivir at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha where some Americans are in quarantine.

In the meantime prevention will always be better than any cure, and it might be a good idea to consider giving your immune system a hand. Stay clear of any one who is sick, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face/food until you have washed your hands. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, and it might be a good idea to increase your garlic and vitamin C intake to boost your immune system. Don’t forget the importance of vitamin D in keeping the immune system strong and modulating the innate adaptive immune responses.",fake

The coronavirus pandemic is causing major disruption across the globe, from the recently announced EU travel ban, suspension of the NBA season and the general shift towards remote work for many American employees. Times are scary, and the deluge of COVID-19 news can be overwhelming at best, and terrifying at worst.

While it's good to stay informed, take practical precautions and look out for yourself and your community during such remarkable events, it's also important to find time for self care, distraction and laughter.

While the TV industry hasn't escaped the pandemic, favorite shows can help soothe and perk us up at least for a half hour at a time. Here are the 10 shows I highly recommend streaming to help alleviate anxiety, spend your self-quarantine time and generally bring a bit more joy into a dark world.

'The Great British Baking Show'

Warm, friendly and with a focus on decent people doing their best (and doing their best to help each other), this British import is one of the happiest TV series ever made. With delectable-looking treats aplenty and kindness abounding, the series (barring the most recent season) is pure joy. And maybe it will inspire you to bake yourself a treat.

Stream it on Netflix.

'Parks and Recreation'

Nothing can stop Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), not even a pandemic. NBC's workplace sitcom is an inspiring stalwart in this genre, full of generally good people trying to do good things. Just skip the two flu-related episodes.

Stream it on Netflix, Hulu or Amazon.

'Making It'

If 'Parks and Rec' isn't enough Poehler and Nick Offerman for you, try their NBC crafting competition reality show. The closest thing the USA has to ""Baking Show,"" the series manages to find sweetness in its crafting, plus a whole lot of overalls for Poehler to wear.

Stream it on Hulu.

'Gilmore Girls'

Although the Gilmore family has plenty of trials and tribulations, the world of quaint small-town Stars Hollow is usually upbeat in this beloved dramedy. The fast-paced jokes and frequent pop culture references help.

Stream it on Netflix.

'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series'

A farcical mockumentary about a high school putting on a production of ""High School Musical,"" the stakes are low in this Disney+ series, though they seem very high (teenagers and their hormones, of course). With a hefty dose of nostalgia, it's a good choice for TV comfort food.

Stream it on Disney+.

'Queer Eye'

If you want to be so moved you come to tears, Netflix's reboot of the makeover reality show is perfect. Inspiration, triumph, overcoming obstacles; all those heartwarming attributes are here when the Fab Five swoop into someone's life to offer as much help as they can give in a week.

Stream it on Netflix.

'Schitt's Creek'

Full of beautiful romance, sunny settings and plenty of humor, Pop TV's sitcom about a rich family that loses it all but gains a little perspective is always a mood booster.

Stream it on Netflix. New episodes on Pop Tuesdays, 9 EDT/PDT.

'The Carol Burnett Show'

Nothing wrong with going classic for your distraction. There are a multitude of series from the mid-20th century available to stream, when TV was a positive affair across the board. I'm partial to the timeless comedy of Burnett, an American treasure.

Stream it on Amazon.

'Fixer Upper'

Chip and Joanna Gaines, their sweet kiddos, many adorable pets and can-do attitude may just give you the confidence you need to get through a tough time. Their home renovations are pretty to look at, too.

Stream it on Hulu.

'Puppy Prep'

A short-form documentary series about service dogs in training, ""Puppy Prep"" is like injecting furry joy right into your veins. With a cheekily funny narrator and a group of very good boys and girls out to do good, there's nothing but uplift here.

The company’s adjusted pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose to 181 million pounds ($221.60 million) from 161.7 million pounds a year ago, while revenue jumped 13% to 1.13 billion pounds.

HomeServe shares, part of the FTSE 250 midcap index, climbed 5% to 1,224 pence by 0708 GMT.

“We have all become acutely aware of the importance of our homes over the last few months, which means that HomeServe’s purpose of making home repairs and improvements easy has never been more relevant,” founder and Chief Executive Officer Richard Harpin said in a statement.

Millions of people across the world have been confined to their homes amid government-imposed lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus.

HomeServe said it was now working with over 950 utilities, up from 700 in fiscal 2019, and has access to 64 million households versus 60 million a year earlier.

“HomeServe has proven resilient during the COVID-19 crisis, making further progress in signing new affinity partners and customers, as well as continuing to complete emergency repairs,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note as they upgraded the stock to “overweight”.

84,520,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/30/21243053/coronavirus-african-american-chicago-violent-crime-covid,2020-04-30,How the coronavirus and Chicago’s gun violence are related,"Why hasn’t violence in Chicago decreased since we have all been ordered to stay at home? Why are the poorest African American neighborhoods that have been plagued by violence now the hardest hit by the coronavirus?

We think these problems have common roots and common solutions.

Gov. J. B. Pritzker issued a statewide shelter-in-place order five weeks ago in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Since that time, Chicago has had over 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 873 virus-related deaths. In that same time period, at least 294 people have been shot and 55 people have been killed in Chicago, placing the city on pace for roughly the same number of shootings and killings as in 2018 and 2019.

Opinion

The virus and violence have race and poverty in common. African Americans comprise roughly 30% of Chicago’s population but make up nearly half of its poor residents and 80% of its homicide victims.

Similarly, blacks represent at least 40% of Chicago’s coronavirus cases and 55% of its pandemic-related deaths. Part of this overrepresentation can be explained by black Chicagoans’ disproportionate rates of chronic health conditions, employment in “essential” economic sectors, reliance on public transportation and uninsurance, all of which increase one’s chances of infection and severe symptomatology.

But another key link between violence and the virus are large numbers of alienated young people on Chicago’s South and West Sides. Like in many other places, young people are ignoring the stay-at-home and social-distancing orders coming from elected officials, heightening the risk of viral infection and transmission. In Chicago, these young people are often the same ones involved in the city’s rampant gun violence that has persisted throughout the pandemic.

Our research with gang members in Chicago over the last 20 years indicates that today’s gang wars are vendettas driven by young people facing desolate circumstances and few, if any, meaningful prospects for a better life.

In other areas of the world, organized crime groups have stepped in to respond to the pandemic, filling voids left by the retreat of the state. In Mexico and southern Italy, drug cartels and Mafia groups are distributing packages of food to desperate residents. In the favelas of Brazil, drug gangs are imposing a curfew and South African gangs have organized peace treaties and are providing community aid.

Chicago, however, has no such organized gangs, particularly in its black neighborhoods, where the monolithic gangs of the 1980s and 1990s have shattered into small, hyperlocal, horizontally organized cliques. There has been no organized response to the pandemic from these groups, since they lack the organization and resources to form any such response. The old gang days are over, and the new cliques are hanging out as usual.

What is needed on Chicago’s South and West Sides, however, is not more organized gangs; it is a more legitimate and benevolent state. The desperate conditions in these communities that are driving both the gun violence and coronavirus crises have been caused by decades of private sector abandonment and a public sector that has largely abdicated its role in ensuring people’s welfare in favor of policing and incarcerating.

The public response should not be to lock these youth up in death traps like Cook County Jail, but to invest in the South and West Sides to give these youth essential resources, hope, and a reason to live. Mayor Lightfoot’s INVEST South/West proposal would do much to reverse decades of city abandonment in these communities, but without explicit protections for current residents, these efforts are likely to result in rent intensification and displacement for their targeted beneficiaries.

A broad-based public employment initiative is perhaps the most desperately needed intervention in communities where Depression-era levels of unemployment existed even before the pandemic — and are doubtlessly much worse now. The relative disorganization of today’s gangs and their often-marginal involvement in the illicit drug economy greatly enhances the potential success of such an initiative. Importantly, however, such a program wouldn’t be limited to these communities and would likely enjoy widespread support given the broader economic devastation wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic.

While the City of Chicago and State of Illinois should marshal whatever resources possible toward this end, they should also demand of their counterparts in Washington — both current and hopeful — that a robust federal response is needed. The recent $3 trillion stimulus proves that funding is no valid obstacle — that where there is a will, there is a way.

Let’s exert the pressure needed to create that will and tackle not only the current coronavirus pandemic, but the ongoing gun violence crisis as well.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him.

The Pulaski County Detention Center is one of three county jails in Illinois contracted by ICE to hold suspected undocumented immigrants. The three immigrants held at Pulaski are the first ICE detainees in Illinois to test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

Damon Acuff, warden at the Pulaski County jail, told the Southern Illinoisan that 130 of the 145 people held at the facility are ICE detainees.

Acuff and Pulaski County Sheriff Randy Kern could not be reached for comment.

On Friday, ICE said the men who tested positive were a 26-year-old Guatemalan, a 33-year-old Honduran and a 32-year-old Mexican.

The Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center is working with Sidley Austin LLP to file federal lawsuits to demand the release of medically vulnerable immigrants detained in Pulaski County.

There are nearly 34,000 immigrants detained by ICE across the country. Nearly two-thirds of them have never been convicted of a crime, according to a recent analysis of detainee records by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

ICE says 61 detainees and 19 detention center employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. Immigrant rights groups have warned about the potential rapid spread of the coronavirus in detention centers.

Lee Vanderlinden, an NIJC staff attorney, said they’re worried about their clients being at risk of contracting the virus at Pulaski County.

“The pods are set up where detainees are all living in an open area with bunk beds or in cells [and] share common areas where everyone eats. It’s impossible to keep six feet distance apart,” they said.

Lupe Perez, another NIJC attorney, said her client at the detention center is worried he’s defenseless against the virus.

Detainees “are not provided soap,” she said, “and they have to use the little money they have in commissary to buy soap, which means they can’t afford to talk to family.”

Earlier this week, the NIJC and Sidley Austin filed lawsuits on behalf of three people detained at the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee seeking their release.

Two of those immigrants, one of whom is a 46-year-old man who’s lived in Illinois for 30 years, were released Friday. The third has a hearing scheduled over the weekend.

111,1011,https://www.politico.eu/article/whats-fueling-south-korea-coronavirus-covid19-success-and-relapse/,2020-05-15,What’s fueling Korea’s coronavirus success — and relapse,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations and the person in charge of the company’s global supply chain, detailed the changes the company’s suppliers are making in a letter at the beginning of the report.

The company has worked with its global supply chain “on a range of protections suited to the circumstances in each country, including health screenings, limiting density, and ensuring strict adherence to social distancing in their facilities,” said Khan.

Apple will require the use of personal protective equipment

Apple will require the use of personal protective equipment during work and “in all common areas,” according to the letter. Apple has worked with its supply chain partners to implement “enhanced deep cleaning protocols” and make masks and sanitizers available to workers, said Khan.

Apple has also worked with suppliers to change factory floor plans and implemented flexible working hours and staggered work shifts to allow workers to “maximize interpersonal space,” he said.

“From the outset, we worked with our suppliers to develop and execute a plan that puts the health of people first,” said Khan. “Thousands of Apple employees have worked tirelessly to execute that plan in partnership with our suppliers around the world.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly informed employees in April that the company would likely be implementing temperature checks and social distancing when its staffers returned to the company’s offices. Some employees may be returning to those offices soon. And after closing all of its retail stores outside the US in mid-March, some stores in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama, and Alaska will apparently be opened sometime this week, and employees at those stores will be required to take temperature tests and wear masks.",real

State totals now stand at 1,975 deaths and 13,218 confirmed cases in nursing homes, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Long-term care facilities account for 48.7% of all coronavirus deaths in Illinois, records show.

The state’s long-term care facilities reported 455 new deaths and 2,405 new cases this week, according to data released Friday by state health officials.

New deaths were reported at 180 facilities this week, and 259 homes said they had at least one new confirmed case.

A total of 86 homes have seen double-digit deaths tallies, up from 50 last week. There are now 27 facilities reporting at least 100 confirmed cases.

The Meadowbrook Manor of Bolingbrook and the Center Home for Hispanic Elderly in Humboldt Park are reporting the most coronavirus deaths of any facility in the state; both have 26. Glenview Terrace and Symphony of Joliet have 25 deaths each.

As was the case last week, Ludeman Developmental Center in Park Forest is reporting the most cases in the state with 268 confirmed positives and six deaths. But that facility also has no new deaths this week and only three new cases.

In some cases, however, nursing homes took deaths and cases out of their count since last week. State officials have said adjustments can be made as deaths are investigated, and there could be mix-ups as the data passes from homes reporting to their local health departments, which then report to the state.

Seven facilities reported at least one fewer death than last week, amounting to 10 deaths taken out of the total count. Another combined 65 homes took a total of 444 cases off the board.

One home, Sheltered Village in Woodstock, reported 80 fewer total cases than last week, according to state data. Administrators at that facility weren’t available to clarify the data Friday evening.

Asked about lags and changes in reported deaths at his press briefing Friday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said health officials regularly examine the data for errors or duplicates.

“Sometimes there could be a misspelled name, and maybe another report had a different name and so you would maybe count them twice and then after further review, you can see no, in fact, these are the same individuals,” Pritzker said. “So, again, there is some time that’s needed to re-look at the data to make sure that there aren’t errors.”",real
131,1671,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/how-coronavirus-is-changing-access-to-abortion-273193,2020-05-21,How coronavirus is changing access to abortion,"Since the outbreak, 94 percent of IPPF EN members responding to the survey ""reported a decrease in the number and frequency of services and outreach activities,"" according to the report.

It also takes to task governments, such as those in Poland and Romania, that have used the outbreak ""to undermine women’s health and safety just when this most needs to be protected.""

The EPF and IPPF EN are among the many groups calling on governments to recognize sexual and reproductive health care services as ""essential, life-saving and often time-sensitive services.""

Advocates and practitioners stress the time-sensitive nature of abortion, whereby barriers can increase health risks either by necessitating surgical procedures or barring access altogether.

One key factor is that supply chain delays have affected operations, according to Chris Purdy, CEO of DKT International, a non-profit that operates in 60 countries outside Europe and distributes contraception and abortion services and technology.

“Pretty much every single link of the supply chain is being affected by the strain connected to coronavirus,"" he said.

Delays can start with manufacturers, who depend on raw material suppliers, as they experience “slow-downs, shut-downs [and] closures of their factories” due to the virus, he said. These suppliers would ordinarily be the providers of everything from active pharmaceutical ingredients to packaging, he added.

These delays continue as export opportunities shrink; quarantines of products on arrival lengthen; and internal supply chains are disrupted.

UNFPA Supplies reported at the end of March that European ""suppliers are manufacturing at full capacity at this time, although they expect increased prices and challenges sourcing packaging and APIs [active pharmaceutical ingredients] if the crisis persists.""

That report, which is the most recent accounting, also includes a projection for coming months.

""Mindful of anticipated challenges, suppliers are seeking 'free carrier' contract arrangements under which UNFPA would arrange transportation for deliveries in the third and fourth quarters of 2020,"" the report said.

While supply issues in Europe don't look too dire for now, “there will be a greater demand for women who are interested in limiting, or controlling or terminating their pregnancies, because usually that's what happens at times of uncertainty,” Purdy noted.



In a climate in which people are confined to their homes and apprehensive about visiting medical staff, difficulties in maintaining access to reproductive health care services and products extend beyond supply chains.

“You're trying to move toward tele-health visits and really encouraging self-care as much as possible where that is feasible,” said Daniel Grossman, an ob-gyn and professor at the University of California San Francisco.

""Contraception is one area ... where it would be safe and effective to make these methods available without a prescription,"" he said. ""This crisis is a good argument for expanding that kind of access, at least during the pandemic.""

In March, France implemented temporary measures allowing women to use expired scripts to renew their oral contraceptive prescriptions. In neighboring Belgium, the government pushed ahead with existing plans to make the morning-after pill free, as well as other forms of contraception for those aged 18 to 25.

That measure ""will be key to continue ensuring access to contraception given the social and economic impact the crisis will have on women,"" the EPF and IPPF EN report said.



But the group also noted that its members in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, North Macedonia, Portugal and Spain ""have reported that they have been forced to scale back contraceptive care.""

Reduced attendance at medical clinics ""due to fear of contracting Covid-19"" and hindered access to long-acting reversible contraception, such as contraceptive injections, implants or intrauterine devices, are among the barriers to reproductive health imposed by the pandemic, the report noted.

Tele-health is also a huge topic in the abortion sector.

On March 30, the British government introduced temporary measures that allow women to take abortion pills for early medical termination at home, provided that they follow a tele-health or physical consultation with a registered medical practitioner.



Prior to that decision, the U.K. allowed medical abortions — which involve the administration of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, or surgical abortions — generally only up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Ireland has implemented similar provisions, allowing remote consultations in most cases for women seeking early medical abortions, while France has extended access to home medical abortions for women up to nine weeks pregnant, up from seven weeks as previously allowed.

By contrast, in the Netherlands, the Court of the Hague rejected an application to allow access to medical abortions without visiting an abortion clinic.

Meanwhile, Germany, which requires mandatory counseling before abortions, has allowed this preliminary step to take place over the phone or by video, following pressure from pro-choice groups.

But Christiane von Rauch, a member of Doctors for Choice Germany, said this measure still leaves some access problems unaddressed, including shortages of personal protective gear in surgeries and clinics.

""Lack of PPE is a major issue cited by almost all respondents,"" agreed the EPF and IPPF EN report.

The immediate challenge aside, the lasting impact of Covid-19 on global access to abortions could be mixed, experts say.

“The anti-abortion movement, at least in the U.S., is really trying to capitalize on the pandemic to essentially make abortion illegal in several states,” Grossman said, referring to moves by Texas and some other Republican-governed states to issue bans on abortions during the outbreak on grounds they're non-essential medical procedures.

""They've used the restrictions on what kind of businesses can continue to operate to say that abortion services are not essential health care and services need to stop,"" he added.

In Europe, advocates continue to call on governments to improve access, raising particular concern around countries such as Poland, where restrictive abortion laws have been compounded by border closures — a major hurdle given that Polish women used to go to Slovakia or Germany for the procedure.

Now, women are not just cut off from travel; they also can’t count on Polish facilities, as they lack both doctors and necessary equipment.

Another country noted in the report is Romania, where the EPF and IPPF EN noted that ""the decision to suspend non-emergency procedures is in practice hindering women’s reproductive freedom.""

In response to criticism, Romanian Health Minister Nelu Tătaru has said he takes women’s rights issues seriously and that each case had to be analyzed by the doctor, according to local media. It's not clear, however, if the situation has improved in the meantime, as the country continues to be under a state of emergency until May 14.

On the other side, the introduction of emergency measures means there's also a potential ""switch"" moment for reproductive health care in Western European countries such as the U.K., Purdy says.

""It's hard to roll that back once that door is open,"" he said. ""And if they allow it there, then you can imagine it might start to happen in other places.""

is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.

Feminists on the frontline of gender politics have seized on a poll they helped publish to push their agenda to the fore in a crisis that has wrecked everyone’s economies and lives. Disproportionate male deaths got a side note.

A new poll by IPSOS Mori declares that UK women are bearing the emotional brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. Fair point, but is it sexist to mention that it’s men who actually die more?

In fact, men are almost twice as likely as women to die from the coronavirus, but women, as the study has found, are about 15 to 20 percent more worried about various other aspects of the pandemic.

I get it. The poll was published in conjunction with the Fawcett Society, named for the iconic suffragette Millicent Fawcett, so with a touch of cynicism you’ll see the goal here.

Also on rt.com Covid-19 is a disaster for everyone… except straight white men?

Even though the study mentions up front the fact men are in more danger from disease itself, that mention is nowhere to be found in the headlines on the Fawcett Society (why would it be?), or IPSOS, or the Guardian, which declares: ‘UK women bear emotional brunt of Covid-19 turmoil – poll’ and mentions problems of risk and unemployment they face. Their stories do mention that men are dying disproportionately but hey, women are affected in other ways that aren’t death.

And isn’t that more important? My guess is I’m seen as a man just propagating a culture of male domination, though biased feminist polling is a-okay.

Polls are commissioned to prove a point that needs apparently objective validation. Very rarely does a political outfit pay a polling company without having a fair idea of what the results will be. What they seek is the credibility earned by using an independent polling business that gives the results kudos.

So we have 61 percent of women struggling day to day to stay positive while 47 percent of men admit to feeling the same.

In gender politics the old adage that a woman’s work is never done holds true, particularly when that woman is fighting on the feminist frontline and there’s suddenly an unexpected opportunity to strike a blow against the patriarchal hegemony.

What is conveniently overlooked is that data collection on an issue such as this is skewed by its very nature.

You’re not asking what sort of soap powder an interviewee prefers here, you’re asking men and women how they feel.

And there lies the problem. While women are far more upfront about peaks and troughs in their emotions, a man asked to explain his feelings will do nothing of the sort. Hardwired to put on a front, most blokes will shrug and mumble, “I’m not too worried” even when pushed whether he’s concerned at the death of thousands of his countrymen at the hands of an invisible virus.

It’s not that it isn’t something to bother about or that men are mostly unfeeling, uncaring boneheaded neanderthals, it’s just that the average Joe would rather not discuss his emotions with you and a relatively neutral answer is far more likely to end a line of questioning sooner than if he opened up and blubbed out his darkest nightmares.

So while six out of 10 women admit they are struggling and less than half of men questioned admitted to feeling likewise, it has to be concluded, “Well they would say that!”

It’s people who suffer, not men or women

And it’s not just the elastic treatment of poll results that irritate here, it’s the gender politics at play when it’s really not appropriate.

It’s ‘people’ who are suffering, whose loved ones are dead, jobs lost, schools shut and dreams in tatters.

It’s not a man and woman thing, its humanity as a whole and it is wrong and insensitive to prioritise one group over another, whether they be different sexes, ages, races or religions. But Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society CEO, has found a man-shaped windmill to tilt at pushing a feminist agenda that somehow men are using the pandemic to assert masculine dominance.

She recently drummed up support from the various members of The Sisterhood to sign a joint statement explaining how bad things are for women in the UK since the pandemic struck.

Also on rt.com The gender sleep gap? Wake me up when the nightmare of modern feminism is over

The statement spoke of women being “largely invisible from the debate and excluded from decision-making,” and many were “trapped in their homes, self-isolating with an abusive partner” as if this was the norm. I found that claim insulting.

It goes on about “specific challenges women are facing,” having “voices heard” and “needs met.” Certainly, interesting ideas to discuss, and there may even be some valid demands in there.

There is no mention anywhere among these concerns about who the majority of victims of the Covid-19 crisis might be.

It’s strange, because they are the grandfathers, fathers, husbands and sons of the gender-obsessed feminist brigade who insist on propagating nonsense like this week’s poll results.

The people behind a running boom in Chicago are grabbing what they have in their closets and heading out the door to burn calories and stress. Or at least that’s what appears to be happening.

“This is anecdotal, there’s no data to support it, but it’s being observed, just the number of people you see running. It’s a visible change, and it’s being discussed by the entire running industry,” Chicago Area Running Association Executive Director Greg Hipp said Thursday.

Normal indicators, like a bump in race registrations (they’re off or on hold) or shoe sales (they’re down) aren’t accounting for the bump.

It makes perfect sense, though.

“When the economy is challenged, more people run because it’s affordable. People who can’t go to the local gym have taken up running,” Hipp said.

“They’re not running for sport, it’s for mental and physical health,” Hipp said.

“The running industry is in crisis. It will be interesting to see how many of these new runners will fall in love and turn to the sport side of it.”

Manya Gupta, 38, of Logan Square, is part of the new wave of runners.

The Rush University Medical Center physician held this belief for a long time: “I’m not a runner. I hate running.” But the stress of treating coronavirus patients became too much, and she needed a way to cope, so she laced up.

“I decided to go for a run one day last month and it felt really good. It was crazy, I just ran one mile, but I felt like I relieved a load of stress,” she said.

“I always discounted the stress-relieving effects of running, mostly because I just assumed I hated it so much. But I have to say it really does work, and it’s free.”

Dave Zimmer, owner of Fleet Feet Chicago, is keeping a close eye on the trend.

“We want to bring these people into the fold because we believe it will be great for us and them in the long run,” said Zimmer, noting injury prevention and reduction are Fleet Feet’s main goals.

Sales have gone down significantly since the state’s stay-at-home order kicked in last month, Zimmer said. His seven stores have pivoted to virtual shoe fittings, online sales and curbside pickup.

“The clearance section of our website is being shopped quite a bit these days, and those items are just as good, but may be from last season and present the best value in these challenging times.”",real

Sadly, he’s surrounded by evil and corruption in Washington D.C., and he’s made some mistakes, especially in picking the wrong people who turned out to be traitors (Jeff Sessions, anyone?). But from what I’ve learned, Trump is still fighting for humanity, and he hasn’t gone over to the dark side as many of us had feared.

In summary, although my fears were grounded in honestly observed actions involving Trump, his “vaccine czar” and Dr. Fauci’s influence at the White House, I have now learned from reliable sources that Trump is fully aware of the risks of vaccines, the dangers of the Big Pharma drug cartels and the need to respect health freedom across America.

At the same time, Trump has taken other actions that are courageous and compelling:

I can confidently tell you today that my fears were unfounded. President Trump has not given in to Big Pharma and the vaccine industry, and he actually pushed Fauci onto the stage in order to attract intense public scrutiny that has now exposed the Fauci fraud for what it really is.

( Natural News ) Today we bring you an important update and correction. I had previously voiced concerns about Trump promoting Big Pharma and the coronavirus, fearing that the White House had been taken over by the “death science” con man Dr. Fauci and other Big Pharma operatives.

Americans ought to consider an alternative explanation for the president’s many untruths: He does not grasp the most basic aspects of the public-health crisis.

Cluelessness may, for example, better explain Trump’s statements on the expected COVID-19 death toll. On April 10, Trump said that the final number of U.S. deaths could be as few as 55,000, a mark the country surpassed before the end of that month. A week later, Trump said that the death toll would maybe reach 65,000, even as deaths rose at a rate that meant that mark would be overtaken within weeks. On April 27, when coronavirus deaths numbered about 56,000, Trump again reiterated lowball estimates, declaring, “We’re probably heading to 60,000 or 70,000.” By April 29, the death toll was about 63,000. That same day, Trump mused that total deaths would be “65 or 70 or 60 or whatever the final number will be.” Only after those opportunities to learn from past mistakes did Trump say, “Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.” And that 100,000 figure? The New York Times noted at the time that it “underestimates what his own administration is now predicting to be the total death toll by the end of May.”

Why did Trump keep offering estimates so unrealistically low that they were overtaken by events mere weeks later, exposing him to mockery and providing fodder for attack ads? Lies are typically self-serving. Those statements were not. If he was trying to lowball death estimates so that Americans would reelect him, he needed to pick a number that wouldn’t be exceeded until after Election Day. Whether he intended to lie or attempted to tell the truth, he showed an inability to think just weeks ahead in an emergency that could last months or years.

Similarly, why did Trump declare that the virus would disappear when its spread was imminent? Why did he say we’re close to a vaccine when Americans are unlikely to get one before Election Day? Why did he suggest that injecting a disinfectant into the body might cure COVID-19? I used to worry that Trump’s serial mendacity might harm the nation. Now I worry even more that he isn’t lying, but rather lacks the capacity to see errors in the most obvious falsehoods. He appears to be so impulsive and attuned to the time horizon of an individual tweet, television appearance, or news cycle that he cannot strategize over a longer period.

Some Americans are willing to forgive lies from the president, but even they shouldn’t shrug off the possibility that Trump simply doesn’t understand the pandemic clearly enough to respond to it effectively.

“She tested positive out of the blue,” Trump said when a press secretary for the vice president tested positive for COVID-19. “This is why the whole concept of tests aren't necessarily great,. The tests are perfect, but something can happen between a test––where it’s good, and then something happens, and all of a sudden––she was tested very recently and tested negative. And then today, I guess, for some reason, she tested positive.”",real
158,433,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/24/21235025/coronavirus-deaths-illinois-nursing-homes,2020-04-24,"Coronavirus deaths more than double at Illinois nursing homes, data shows","The state’s count of coronavirus cases and deaths in long-term care facilities has more than doubled, according to numbers published Friday after a major nursing-home operator’s CEO warned they would reflect a “surge in new cases and more heartbreaking deaths.”

But the numbers, published weekly, appear to be a lagging indicator of what is actually happening around the state — meaning the actual count could be higher. For example, one South Side nursing home has publicized far higher numbers than reported by the state Friday. A spokeswoman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the numbers released earlier by the individual nursing homes are reliable.

The new numbers reflect 4,298 coronavirus cases and 625 deaths in nursing homes across the state, according to a count by the Chicago Sun-Times. Pritzker’s office first released nursing home numbers last week, which showed 1,860 residents and staff members had tested positive. Of those, 286 had died.

“It should not come as a surprise to anyone,” Citadel Healthcare CEO Jonathan Aaron said during an online press conference Friday. “Because the state expanded testing this week, and some operators also partnered with hospitals to test every resident and every employee.”

Aaron warned the state’s new numbers would reflect a surge. But he also called the state’s data “a limited snapshot.”

“This virus moves silently and more quickly than we can, making data outdated even at the time of posting,” said Aaron, whose organization is also a member of the Health Care Council of Illinois.

The state says it is gathering data on long-term care facilities on a rolling basis from two national databases, with a slight lag in the numbers that hit its website. Aaron also acknowledged “reasonable delays in reporting,” given the rapid spread of the virus. But he said Citadel Healthcare is following the state’s reporting requirements.

Symphony Care Network spokeswoman Natalie Bauer Luce said earlier this week that 111 residents at Symphony South Shore had contracted the coronavirus, and 10 residents there had died from the disease. But the state’s numbers released Friday only show that the facility had 35 coronavirus cases and two deaths.

Luce said earlier this week that long-term care facilities are required to notify the state and local health departments upon the diagnosis of a resident or staff member. Aaron said Citadel reports every case within 12 hours.

The numbers released Friday would indicate more than a third of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois are tied to senior facilities, up from a quarter of all deaths last week. Though Aaron said the state’s testing at nursing homes is “deeply appreciated,” he called it belated and “off to a slow start.”

“We urge the state to shift to rapid-response, mobile laboratories operated by the National Guard,” Aaron said, adding, “our residents deserve coordinated widespread testing.”

Pritzker at his daily briefing Friday said testing residents and staff at nursing homes is a top priority for the state.",real

The Indian Navy has announced its operational preparedness, but there are severe costs for the anti-China maritime posture in the region.

The Chinese Ministry of National Defence (MND) announced the deployment of the 690 naval personnel-strong 35th Task Force of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday in order to carry out anti-piracy patrols in the Indian Ocean, which is considered India’s geopolitical sphere of influence.

The PLAN's guided missile destroyer the Taiyan and the frigate Jingzhou will for the first time ever protect ""ships and vessels” passing through the region.

The task force, comprising at least two dozen naval helicopters and replenishment oiler the Chaohu, will also support vessels off the coast of Somalia, where the PLAN has been carrying out naval escort missions since December 2008.

The announcement comes at a time when the International Maritime Bureau’s latest global piracy report shows zero hijackings in the last two quarters and no incidents around Somalia. Global shipping data also suggest a massive decline in the number of ships calling on ports, including in Europe and China.

Explaining the purpose of such a deployment at this time, Captain D.K. Sharma, who retired from the Indian Navy in September 2019 after serving as the spokesperson for 10 years, tells Sputnik: “The foothold which the PLA Navy established in 2008 in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), in the garb of anti-piracy missions, won't be diluted at any cost”.

The captain brings up Beijing’s strategy – termed the ""String of Pearls"" by the US consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton in its 2005 report “Energy Futures in Asia” – to expand its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) by building maritime civilian infrastructure in friendly countries.

© AFP 2020 / HO / Iranian Army office A photo shows a view of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force Type 052D destroyer Xining (117), the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy frigate ""ALBORZ"" (72), and the Russian Navy Neustrashimyy-class frigate ""Yaroslav Mudry"" (777) during joint Iran-Russia-China naval drills in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman

“It (String of Pearls) was a well thought-out strategy. Also, they (Beijing) have interests in the Indian Ocean Region with Djibouti, Gwadar, Myanmar Bangladesh etc., as part of their One Belt One Road programme. Anti-piracy patrol is an alibi to cover up their other designs in the overall scheme of things”, the captain says.

Ever since the 2005 report, many strategic analysts have also termed it as a strategy to encircle India, which has a dominant position in the Indian Ocean Region. However, China has denied any such strategy.

“Happy Hunting” Has Its Cost

The Indian Navy has clearly indicated that it will not lose its stance in the Indian Ocean Region, despite the battle against COVID-19.

Stating the impact of China in the Indian Ocean Region, former Indian Navy spokesperson Sharma says: “Presence of Chinese PLA Navy ships in Indian Ocean Region [does] make a difference to [the] Indian Navy as they have to keep a constant eye on their movements. These ships are involved in many other activities apart from normal patrols in Gulf of Aden”.

For the second time in a month, when it is assisting civilian authorities in the fight against COVID-19, the Indian Navy released a statement on 18 April stating: “Our assets continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Straits of Malacca in the East to Bab-el-Mandeb in the West, including undertaking Operation Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in Gulf of Aden”.

Sharma also states that this will only add a financial burden on the Indian Navy, which has also increased its strategic co-operation of-late to counter China.

Apart from incurring huge costs on operating around 50 combat-ready warships — destroyers, frigates, corvettes, large patrol vessels — and daily sorties by Poseidon P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, which are now permanently positioned in the Indian Ocean Region, the “mission-based deployment” also wears out the Indian Navy’s combat assets and trained personnel.

Indian Navy commanders have raised concerns over critical capability gaps in ship-borne helicopters, fleet support ships, and submarines. This means that continuous deployment of these assets raises the possibility of accidents and encounters at sea.

These concerns compound the already existing financial crisis caused by COVID-19, as a top official of India's Defence Ministry told Sputnik that the defence budget is being reduced by 20-30 percent this year.

For 2020, the Navy received around $3 billion for revenue expenditures and around $3.8 billion for capital expenditures, which is $3 billion lower than the projected expenditure this year. The Navy had already pulled back its requirement of Mine Counter Measure Vessels, helicopters, and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft.

Naval Deployments for All

The two Asian giants have emphasised time and again that their naval deployments are not only for their own purposes, but they can provide assistance to their friendly neighbours as well.

As China despatched its naval combat force — the first time in four years — consisting of around a dozen warships, India called off any strong action against the then Abdulla Yameen government, which was considered pro-China.

Past incidents suggest that such deployments come in handy in times of crisis to governments having close relations with Beijing. This was evident in 2018, when the Abdulla Yameen government announced a state of emergency in the Maldives and India had to rush its aircraft and ships to its southern bases.

However, India has been moving forward to establish a new base on Assumptions Island in the Seychelles and negotiated military access to naval facilities at ports in Oman and Indonesia last year.

COVID-19 Challenges to Navy

Indian Navy Chief Karambir Singh told commanders in a video message on 7 March that “it can no longer be business as usual”.

Hence, the Chinese deployment in a time of crisis poses a big challenge for the Indian Navy, whose warships are teeming with men more than other navies — as evident during the multilateral exercise — to operate in full capability while maintaining physical distancing to remain COVID-19-free.

169,1357,https://amgreatness.com/2020/05/18/fraudulent-models-fatal-consequences/,2020-05-18,"Fraudulent Models, Fatal Consequences","These models, and the decisions based on them, should not inflict any more damage.

It was the model that shocked the world.

In mid-March, British researchers issued an alarming study that predicted 2.2 million Americans would die of COVID-19 by August without immediate, draconian measures to halt its spread. As the virus rampaged across the country, more than 80 percent of Americans would be infected, the experts warned, causing massive shortages of hospital beds and intensive care units. Death and misery would be the new norm for months to come.

Dr. Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at the London-based Imperial College who led the team, made “social distancing” a household term. “A combination of case isolation, social distancing of the entire population and either household quarantine or school and university closure are required,” Ferguson wrote. “All four interventions combined are predicted to have the largest effect on transmission.”

Ferguson’s work terrified policymakers, the news media, and general public. Dr. Deborah Birx referenced the model during a March 16 press briefing at the White House. “Sweeping new federal recommendations announced on Monday for Americans to sharply limit their activities appeared to draw on a dire scientific report warning that, without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die,” the New York Times reported March 16.

Ferguson strayed from the role of objective scientist to global policy advisor, insisting his harsh rules should continue for at least 18 months until a vaccine was found. “It’s a difficult position for the world to be in,” he opined after his paper’s release.

Acting on Ferguson’s doomsday predictions, the Centers for Disease Control issued strict guidance that prompted state officials to close schools; shutter “nonessential” businesses; and issue stay-at-home orders. They simply were acting on the best available science and data, governors claimed, as they ordered their constituents to live under a form of house arrest for weeks on end.

Crude Mathematical Guesswork

But Ferguson’s study wasn’t science—or anything close to it.

Like so many scientific “models,” the purpose of Ferguson’s work was to influence policy decisions instead of providing a forecast of future events based on solid data. The “buggy” computer code that Ferguson used is more than a decade old; a few weeks after issuing his first set of charts, Ferguson drastically reduced the projected body count without explanation.

Now, as the consequences of Ferguson’s untested prescription to mitigate COVID-19 are coming into stark relief, including historic rates of unemployment and other unforeseen tragedies, his work is facing broad condemnation.

One software engineer, in a thorough analysis of Ferguson’s methods, said that “all papers based on this code should be retracted immediately. Imperial’s modelling efforts should be reset with a new team that isn’t under Professor Ferguson.”

A weekend column in The Telegraph concluded that Ferguson’s coronavirus models “will supersede the failed Venus space probe and could go down in history as the most devastating software mistake of all time, in terms of economic costs and lives lost.”

Matt Ridley, author of numerous award-winning scientific books, posed this blunt question: “Did we base one of the biggest peacetime policy decisions on crude mathematical guesswork?”

The answer, unfortunately, is yes.

But it’s too late to extract any accountability from Dr. Neil Ferguson. In what now looks like a convenient excuse, Ferguson stepped down from his government advisory post earlier this month for breaking his own social distancing policy by having an affair with a married woman. His resignation came just as criticism of his study intensified both here and in the U.K.

Now there is no way to question Ferguson publicly let alone censure him for his reckless work.

Murray’s Defective Model

Ferguson’s model, however, isn’t the only fraudulent model that led to destructive policy decisions. Citing the Imperial College model, Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, produced another set of graphs at the end of March that expanded on Ferguson’s pseudoscientific “social distancing” demands.

Much like Ferguson, Murray portrayed plague-like conditions in the United States once COVID-19 took hold.

“In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic will place a load on health system resources well beyond the current capacity of hospitals in the USA…especially for ICU care and ventilator use,” Murray warned. “The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures within three weeks in all locations that have not done so already and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic.”

Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci, without subjecting the raw paper to any peer review, presented Murray’s charts to President Trump at the end of March. According to the president, they then insisted he “shut everything down.” The CDC guidance, first implemented for 15 days, was extended to April 30. (Murray’s model has been updated 16 times since its March 26 release.)

Subsequently, the world’s most robust economy has crashed, 36 million Americans (and counting) have applied for unemployment, critical health care services have been delayed, kids will be out of school for at least five months, and economists are predicting a double-digit drop in economic growth for at least the next quarter—yet none of Murray’s most outlandish projections, including hospital bed and ventilator shortages, materialized.

Further, while Murray and his boosters made all sorts of noise about closing grade schools and staying six feet apart at the grocery store, they overlooked one critical vector for the disease: nursing homes.

It is increasingly likely that by the time all the data is collected and verified, at least half the total number of coronavirus-related fatalities will be tied to nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In some states, roughly three-quarters of all COVID-19 deaths have been nursing home residents.

The question of how to protect the most fragile and helpless from contracting coronavirus not only was ignored by the researchers at IHME, it also was of no concern to big-state governors including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and California Governor Gavin Newsom. They, along with others, instituted policies that mixed infected nursing home residents with uninfected residents and workers. “The result has been a raging wildfire of infection and death,” one university professor of ethics wrote in the Times on Sunday. Some Congressional Republicans want investigations into the deadly decisions.

So, as modelers and governors warned about the dangers of healthy beach-goers, tens of thousands of vulnerable seniors succumbed to COVID-19. Ironically, because of the large numbers of nursing home fatalities, Murray’s overall death count might be right despite his glaring omission. He will take credit for accuracy even though he never factored in nursing home residents or bothered to offer strategies to protect them.

The White House still has time to rectify its reliance on these fraudulent models. The president could begin by acknowledging both the Ferguson and Murray studies were highly flawed documents that fueled unnecessary fear. If he is serious about opening up the country as quickly as possible, President Trump needs to acknowledge the mistake. Tear up the ever-changing CDC guidance, protect the most vulnerable, prepare our healthcare system, and get Americans back to work and back to normal. These models, and the decisions based on them, should not inflict any more damage.",fake

“The pandemic has uncovered some ugly truths about the lack of access to good healthcare and affordable housing in the black community,” says Beckham, who’s lived in Bronzeville on and off for 55 years. “I’ve always focused on providing what’s needed in my neighborhood. A lot of people have moved away. My goal is to bring them back.”

That’s Leon Walker’s aim, too.

“We want to encourage others who grew up in these communities, like I did, to invest in the neighborhood,” says Walker, another South Side developer. “Now is the time to return home.“

A growing consensus among Chicago developers and planners seems to be that concentrated, block-by-block redevelopment is the surest way to bring in the people and businesses needed to strengthen the city’s black communities, which have disproportionately borne the brunt of COVID-19.

Beckham’s current project is 43 Green, a mixed-use development centered around the 43rd Street CTA Green Line stop being done as a joint venture with the Habitat Company,. The first phase of the project, to be built on a city-owned lot, calls for an eight-story building with 91 apartments — half affordable housing, half market rate — built over ground-floor shops.

If that goes well, Beckham plans two other buildings nearby. A townhouse development by another builder recently was completed across the street.

“It’s all about density,” Beckham says. “That’s a major part of keeping retail strong.”

A good retail mix will attract new residents.

“A lot of young professionals live elsewhere in Chicago because they can’t find the amenities they want in Bronzeville,” Beckham says. “Our focus is to add some spark and bring in new faces and energy.”

City Hall seems to have come to the same realization. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has created the INVEST South/West program to catalyze redevelopment of commercial corridors in 10 neighborhoods on the South Side and West Side. Unlike previous, scattershot efforts, the idea is to focus economic development efforts in selected areas, signaling to private business interests that these are good places to invest.

“Revitalization strategies work best when you get synergy,” says Maurice Cox, the city’s commissioner of planning and development. “You have to create an ecosystem, with one investment next to another. That generates momentum and encourages others to join you.”

The most promising of the 10 targeted communities is greater Bronzeville, from Lake Michigan to the Dan Ryan Expressway and 26th Street to 51st Street. The area has many strengths, including a committed middle-class base. What it doesn’t have is a thriving commercial district.

It needs one to improve the quality of life for current residents and to help the neighborhood — and ultimately the whole South Side — attract newcomers.

Bringing in new people is essential. The 2020 census is likely to show that Chicago lost more than 135,000 black residents over the past decade, offsetting population gains by other groups. That’s on top of a decline of 181,000 black people in the 2010 census.

It’s not enough to just stop those losses. Lightfoot says she wants to boost Chicago’s population to 3 million — 300,000 more than now.

To do that, the city needs to draw people from elsewhere. Looking to the past as a guide, it will largely be college graduates who decide to make Chicago their new home. The percentage of Chicagoans with college degrees has grown from 17% in 1980 to almost 40% now. But most of those college grads weren’t born in Chicago. According to census data, 56% weren’t even born in Illinois.

Of the Illinois college grads, a reasonable assumption is that the number from Chicago reflects the city’s share of the state’s population. That means 90% of college grads now living in Chicago — the chief drivers of the city’s resurgence — were born elsewhere.

The challenge is to make the South Side as attractive as other parts of the city to college grads.

It can be done. At a time when Chicago’s African American communities are beset by violent crime and plunging population, the number of black Chicagoans with college degrees is going up, not down. Since 2010, the number of black college grads in the city has increased by about 15,000, or 15%, vs. 27% growth for the city overall. Still, this shows the potential is there.

Neighborhoods all over the South Side and West Side need commercial revitalization. Bronzeville — because of its lakefront location relatively near downtown — is the most important.

In 1980, Chicago’s college grads were mostly clustered in a narrow band along the lakefront. The revitalized area — a collection of neighborhoods with high education and middle income or better — pushed inland from there and now takes in much of the North Side and Northwest Side.

On the south lakefront, progress has been more uneven. Still, with only a couple of gaps, neighborhoods with a high proportion of college grads now extend all the way down to Woodlawn.

If the North Side pattern repeats, once revitalization is firmly established in Bronzeville, it will gradually spread to other parts of the South Side.

A critical step is establishing a lively business district — the equivalent of the Clark Street/Broadway corridor on the North Side.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Broadway was the heart of what was then called New Town. It was — and is — busy and walkable, with lots of shops and people. College grads who moved to Chicago in that era — like me — typically spent at least a few years living in the vicinity. It was their port of entry into Chicago, their first taste of big-city life.

Bronzeville needs a bustling corridor like that if it’s to be a point of entry for college grads moving to the South Side. Now, it has a path to getting one.

Neighborhood redevelopment isn’t the only thing that needs to happen to rebuild the South Side. College grads don’t come to Chicago just because it’s fun. They’re also looking for jobs and opportunity.

Among U.S. metro areas with the most African American residents, the one having the highest percentage of black college grads is Washington, D.C., with 35% — higher than the national average. The reason is the federal government is based there, with its pick of the nation’s top talent.

Chicago doesn’t have that kind of hiring power, but it does have an expanding downtown economy, which could absorb a lot of black college grads.

“There’s a lot of things moving and growing here,” Beckham says. “I’m really happy to be a part of revitalizing my community.”",real
180,955,https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/5/14/21259380/with-the-focus-on-the-coronavirus-lightfoot-opts-for-bare-bones-capital-plan,2020-05-14,"With the focus on the coronavirus, Lightfoot opts for bare-bones capital plan","Singularly focused on the war against the coronavirus, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has opted for a $100 million, bare bones capital plan — bankrolled by an existing line of credit — to pay for new vehicles, sidewalks and the treasured aldermanic menu program.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.

The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

The bare-bones capital plan is on the agenda for Monday’s Finance Committee meeting.

It includes: $83 million for the aldermanic menu program; $3 million for the shared sidewalk program; and $13.8 million to replace aging police cars and other city vehicles.

“We were taking applications for the shared sidewalks in January. So those commitments have already been made. We’ve got to get the snow plows ordered. We’ve got to get these police cars traded out. These are standard things that have to happen. And they can’t wait,” said Kristen Cabanban, a spokesperson for the city’s Office of Budget and Management.

And what is so urgent about the aldermanic menu program other than the fact that it’s a sacred cow politically?

“They do things like repair streets. They do a lot of infrastructure improvements too. Those things are important to residents as well,” Cabanban said.

A larger and more traditional general obligation bond issue is still a possibility later this year, Cabanban said. But, she quickly added, “We will need to go back and have that discussion at a different time. Right now, our priority is responding to COVID.”

Still unclear is what, if any, impact the shrunken capital plan will have on the $95 million police academy in West Garfield Park.

Last year, Emanuel got the go-ahead to issue $850 million in general obligation bonds to fund a laundry list of capital improvement projects. It included $65 million for the police and fire training, $30 million short of the original price tag.

Last summer, Lightfoot told reporters that the project that critics called a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced spending priorities needed to be made bigger, better and, undoubtedly, more expensive.

After touring the old police academy and seeing recruits apprehending mock suspects in a dark hallway, Lightfoot said she was not at all certain that the two-building campus to be built at 4301 W. Chicago Ave. on 30.4 vacant acres was big enough to house a training facility that will be “best-in-class” not just when it opens, but for decades afterward.

“I don’t know that it’s big enough. I don’t know that the plans, particularly on the fire [department] side, are gonna provide them with the different kind of training scenarios that they need,” the mayor told reporters outside the current facility, 1300 W. Jackson Blvd.

“This is gonna be a significant investment on the West Side that desperately needs investment, but if we’re gonna make that kind of investment, I want to get it right. I want it to be the best-in-class training facility for first responders anywhere in the country. That’s what we ought to aspire to.”

Much like Wintrust Arena, the police academy project became a symbol of Emanuel’s misplaced priorities, critics said. For years, it has drawn fire from Chance the Rapper, Black Lives Matter and other groups who have organized under the #NoCopAcademy label.

Emanuel was even confronted by anti-academy protesters on college campus visits to other cities.

The coalition has argued that the money would be better spent on jobs, youth and education programs.",real

Mayer Hawthorne, Sada Baby, La Britney, Gmac Cash and others will participate in the digital event, which borrows its name from Detroit Vs. Everybody creator Tommey Walker, who introduced an Everybody Vs. COVID-19 line of shirts and hoodies in March.

D-Nice, whose stature has grown during the pandemic due to his hugely popular Instagram Live DJ sessions, will also participate in the event. D-Nice is not a Detroiter but he has ties to the city, and he helped Kid Rock land his record deal in the late 1980s.

“In the spirit of Detroit, we are encouraging continued collaboration by celebrating our city and culture for two important and pressing causes,"" Eric Thomas, Chief Storyteller for the City of Detroit, said in a statement. ""Advocating for safety and awareness about COVID-19 and getting Detroiters to participate in the Census to ensure that we have all the resources we need going forward and in case we ever experience anything like this again.”

Portions of the broadcast will also play on the city's cable channels, according to a release.

184,134,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21191546/dance-parties-instagram-live-zoom-coronavirus-pandemic,2020-03-23,I wanna dance with somebody (on Instagram),"Kristin Childers went to a dance party on Saturday in her pajamas. The clothes didn’t matter, because she never left her living room. The party took place entirely on Instagram.

A few minutes before, she’d been sitting on her couch reading the news, feeling like she was about to cry. Then she got a notification on her phone: Ryan Heffington, the two-time Grammy nominated choreographer behind Sia’s “Chandelier” music video, was streaming a dance class on Instagram Live. “The numbness I was feeling just went away,” she says. “I was like, ‘I’m just gonna do it.’”

As Childers danced, she saw comments and hearts pop up on the live stream. Almost 2,700 people were dancing virtually alongside her. “I was like, ‘Wow people are really connecting,’” she says. She’d had low-grade anxiety since the coronavirus pandemic started spreading across the United States. Now, moving alone in her apartment with only her phone to keep her company, she felt almost optimistic.

“The numbness I was feeling just went away.”

Heffington is part of a wave of dance teachers moving their classes online as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread. In California, where a shelter order has been in place since March 19th, all non-essential businesses — including Heffington’s studio The Sweat Spot — are closed. The result is a rise in social media offerings as people look to their phones to give them a sense of community and help them stay active during the crisis.

But Heffington is well suited to lead the digital dance era. He’s high energy and describes himself as spiritual. His philosophy is that anyone can dance — and anywhere, apparently. “I feel like this is my calling in life,” he says. “I’ve always wanted to make the world dance, and apparently this is the right time to make that happen.”

When Heffington live steamed his first class on March 17th, 500 people showed up. The following weekend, there were close to 4,000. “People that have always been intimidated now have the privacy to dance and are loving it,” he says. “The insecurity level drops considerably because they’re in their own homes.”

Heffington’s classes aren’t the only ones to go online. Dance Church, which calls itself “the dance party you wish you had last night,” is also streaming dance parties. Founded by choreographer Kate Wallich, it typically hosts weekly classes in New York, Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles. Now it’s gone fully digital, streaming on its own platform. Over the weekend, 10,000 people logged on.

Taiana Giefer, a Santa Barbara-based model and artist, is hosting dances on Zoom. She posts the link on social media, then DJs a class that anyone can tune into. She calls them social distancing dance parties.

To Heffington, this is proof that the pandemic is an opportunity for people to come together. “The crisis is showing us how we should function as a society,” he says. “This is what social media was designed for. It’s separated us in some aspects, but at this point in time, it’s kind of all we have, and it’s so beautiful.”

From her living room, Childers agrees. She’s figured out how to project her phone onto her TV, and pushed back her couch to have more space to dance. “Ryan’s next classes are Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week, and I’m going to all of them,” she says. “Why not? I’m going to dance my way through this crisis.”",real

The World Cup in France put a spotlight on women’s soccer, culminating with the United States lifting the trophy to chants of “Equal Pay!” — a nod to the team’s gender discrimination lawsuit against U.S. Soccer — and the sport remained in the public eye to open the year. The professional National Women’s Soccer League, home to many of the U.S. national team’s players, was expecting to open its eighth season with a new television contract.

Women’s pro softball was looking toward the sport’s return to the Olympics for the first time since 2008. Professional volleyball, which enjoys popularity in Europe, Russia and Brazil, similarly draws peak interest in an Olympic year.

Any momentum these leagues, and women’s sports in general, had worldwide has seemingly been halted by the pandemic. Now the question is whether women will lose the gains they had made when life returns to normal.

“If the seas get choppy and rough and you’re out there in a yacht, you can go downstairs and live it up and ride it out. You can eat good, drink good and all that. Men’s sports are the ones with the yacht,” said Cheri Kempf, commissioner of the National Pro Fastpitch softball league. “But if you’re out there in a canoe, and seas get choppy, you’re in big trouble. And that’s women’s sports. You know, we’re riding around out there in a canoe.”

Among the signs women’s sports could suffer more was the recent decision by Independiente Santa Fe in Colombia to suspend all player contracts for its women’s soccer team while saying the men’s team would only see pay cuts.

The impact of COVID-19 and the resulting hit to the economy could resemble the 2008 recession. The Houston Comets of the WNBA could not find a buyer and the league contracted back then. Whirlpool, meanwhile, pulled out of its planned sponsorship of Women’s Professional Soccer, which had the unfortunate timing of launching in 2009 and lasted just three seasons.

The WNBA is in better shape today than many women’s sports because of its affiliation with the NBA. The league has put off the start of the season, set for May 15, but Commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently suggested it might be able to return sooner rather than later.

“We might be able to tip this season off before some other leagues since we only have 12 teams and 144 players,” she told The Associated Press.

But there are concerns among those who aren’t similarly positioned.

Volleyball player Kelsey Robinson, who is on the U.S. team that was bound for the Tokyo Olympics this summer before the games were postponed, can usually make a living playing overseas, like many national team players. She was just heading into the playoffs with her club in Turkey, which has a thriving professional volleyball league, when play was suspended. Now she worries about her opportunities in a post-pandemic world.

“It’s hard to say what will happen in Turkey or China, where there are pretty strong economies for sport. But for sure, Italy I know will have to decrease salaries, maybe not at the top team, but I’m sure it’ll affect lower teams and clubs,” Robinson said. “We’re not finishing the season right now or playing, so that’s a hard financial burden for our club because a lot of the salaries for the coming season depends on how we finish in the playoffs.”

NWSL Players Association executive director Yael Averbuch West said current fears about losses are legitimate.

“I think that everybody is afraid of that. And especially right now, looking at women’s soccer and coming off of what we feel is a huge positive momentum after the World Cup, and the NWSL doing really well and continuing to grow, it’s obviously a concern. This is tough for everyone, including the ownership groups, the fans, the players, the league office,” Averbuch West said.

The international soccer players’ union, FIFPro, issued a report Thursday warning of the impact the coronavirus could have on women’s soccer worldwide and recommended mitigation measures, including continued investment.

“Who knows what the future will bring?” said forward Jodie Taylor, who plays for the NWSL’s Reign and England’s national team and sits on the FIFPro player council. “It’s a reality, it’s a stressful reality, and one that the world’s kind of sitting back and waiting for.”

Athletes in individual sports could be hit hardest. Tennis, golf and track athletes are largely dependent on competing to earn a paycheck, and that’s currently impossible. The athletes face uncertainties going forward: When the events do return, will the sponsors remain? Will younger prospects fall away from those sports out of economic necessity?

The WTA said last week that its planned start date is now July 13. Wimbledon has been canceled for this year.

“Health and safety remains the top priority as we navigate the challenges ahead in these unprecedented times, and we will do everything we can for the tour to resume at the earliest opportunity once it is safe to do so,” ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said.

The National Pro Fastpitch softball league was hit particularly hard. The 17-year-old league included national teams from Australia, Canada and China this season in preparation for the Olympics. Australia and Canada have already said that even if the league gets off the ground this season, they won’t participate.

“I don’t want to say that I’m worried that we won’t survive,” Kempf said. “But I think that common sense would dictate and tell you that it’s a hit for everyone.”",real

According to the journalist, the walls are closing in on the president as his former allies are turning their backs on him.

Brazil is now ranking third in terms of the number of infected, with a fatality rate floating at around 6.4%. Earlier, Bruno Covas, the mayor of Sao Paulo, warned that Brazil's biggest city's public hospitals are ""near collapse"", as over 90% of their beds are occupied by patients and urged President Jair Bolsonaro to shut down the country. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signalled that he was considering restricting travel from Brazil as the country's pandemic is seemingly spiralling out of control.

'Lack of Management' Exacerbating the Problem

""The situation in Brazil becomes more critical every day and the number of contagions and deaths continues to break new records every 24 hours"", says Alan Dantas, a Brazilian journalist and editor of Dossier Sul, an online political magazine. ""The lack of capacity of the central government to work to avoid these numbers is becoming more and more evident. Jair Bolsonaro's government, together with [Brazilian] businessmen, is campaigning for the country to reopen its economic activities and expose people to risk. In many states, health systems have collapsed and in the poorest regions, people remain without health care and die inside their homes"".

The journalist refers to neighbouring Argentina and Venezuela, which have largely managed to get the pandemic under control due to strict quarantine measures and have so far reported 10,649 and 944 confirmed coronavirus cases respectively.

""Brazil lost control of COVID-19 and now the disease already kills more than other health problems"", Dantas opines. ""The big problem is still the lack of management by Jair Bolsonaro's government, which besides not taking care of the disease, makes fun of the death of its citizens"".

From the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak Bolsonaro dismissed it as a ""media trick"" and a ""little flu"" and publicly subjected quarantine restrictions to ridicule. ""We will all die one day"", the president said as quoted by Último Segundo in late March. A month later, he shrugged off news about a spike in coronavirus-related deaths: ""So what? I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?"" he responded to journalists, as cited by The Guardian.

Behind Bolsonaro's calls for opening the country up is a strong lobby from the Brazilian corporate sector, as well as the financial lobby, according to the journalist.

Previously, the president insisted on the necessity to prioritise the economy: ""Are people dying? Oh, yeah. But there will be more people dying, many, many more, if the economy is destroyed by these lockdown measures imposed by governors"", Bolsonaro stated earlier this month, as cited by Euronews.

According to the journalist, Bolsonaro's ""economic crisis"" narrative is aimed at persuading Brazilians that the country's economy will collapse unless its state governors lift the lockdown.

Bolsonaro is on Thin Ice

""The Bolsonaro situation tends to become increasingly unsustainable"", the journalist continues. ""His lack of management in the face of the pandemic and the crisis that Brazil is going through are causing his popularity rates to be lower and lower among the population"".

Bolsonaro's approval rating has fallen to 39.2% from 47.8% in January, according to a CNT/MDA survey, while disapproval of the president has mounted from 47.0% to 55.4%.

The resignations of two health ministers and Justice Minister Sergio Moro's decision to step down in late April ""indicate that Bolsonaro is losing more and more space and has become isolated in the national political scenario"", the journalist suggests.

Moro resigned after Bolsonaro fired Mauricio Valeixo, the federal police chief, in an alleged attempt to shield one of his sons from criminal prosecution. ""I didn’t enter the government to serve a master. I entered it to serve the country, the law"", the former justice minister told Time Magazine, commenting on the matter. The president resolutely denounced the assumptions and even called Moro ""Judas"".

""The [unfolding] scenario triggers many questions about the continuity of [the Bolsonaro] government in the medium term and whether there would already be a propitious scenario for an impeachment process against him, a letter that is already being put on the table"", highlights Alan Dantas. ""It remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro will passively accept this process or risk a coup d'état in the midst of the pandemic"".

On Friday, Brazil's Supreme Court released a video of a cabinet meeting showing Bolsonaro bemoaning his inability to get information from the country's law enforcement officials and vowing to protect his family members. The two-hour video with some portions redacted was made public as part of the ongoing inquiry concerning the president's alleged meddling in a criminal investigation into his son. Although the recent exposure has further escalated tensions in the Brazilian government, Bolsonaro is still strongly denying any wrongdoing.

190,370,https://www.healthnutnews.com/sea-turtles-are-thriving-as-coronavirus-lockdown-empties-florida-beaches/,2020-04-19,CNN: Sea Turtles are Thriving as Coronavirus Lockdown Empties Florida Beaches,"Fewer humans carelessly destroying their natural habitat has been a blessing for sea turtles in Florida.

With many beaches closed in Florida during the coronavirus pandemic, researchers see less plastic and less waste. There are fewer people and vehicles on the beach projecting artificial light; thus there is less disorientation for emerging hatchlings, according to David Godfrey, Executive Director for the Sea Turtle Conservancy.

Because of these factors, sea turtles can build nests without any disruptions.

Godfrey said that nesting season for leatherback turtles, the largest of all sea turtles, is underway right now, mostly in the central-east and southeast coast of Florida. They nest in fewer numbers than the loggerheads, who arrive in May. Later in the summer months is when green turtles will come.

It takes approximately 60 days for sea turtle eggs to incubate and for hatchlings to emerge, Godfrey said. Many disturbing things can happen to their nests when humans take over their beaches. They trample and dig up the turtle’s nests and harm them with artificial light.

RELATED STORY:

With an inactive beach, the turtles can carry on the way nature intended. Godfrey said:

“I think there is a strong likelihood that we will see decreased human-caused impacts on sea turtle nesting this year, which is a rare silver lining to this global pandemic. It’s premature to try and use numbers to demonstrate what we all think and hope is happening. The numbers just aren’t there yet. I hear that the season is going pretty well so far, it’s off to a good start.”

Less foot traffic improves the reptiles situation right now, but what will happen when the beaches reopen, and the sea turtles’ eggs begin to hatch? Leatherback sea turtles will see hatchlings toward the end of April. Godfrey said researchers are working in uncharted territory, and only time will tell.

RELATED STORY:

Dr. Justin Perrault, Director of Research at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center, said his team does worry that when the beaches reopen, there may be an influx of people flocking to the beach because they were stuck indoors for an extended period. He added:

“It just depends on the behavior of people after the closures end. And if there’s an excessive amount on the beaches, then more people means more interaction with turtles, which can be negative if they don’t follow the rules.”

The city of Jacksonville announced beaches and parks in Duval County would open Friday with certain restrictions starting at 5 pm, according to the city’s Twitter page.

Perrault said when people do return, it’ll be essential for them to to keep lights off whenever possible, maintain distance from marine animals, and leave the beach the way they found it. He added:

“Remember that we’re not the only species out there.”

The problem is, however, that there is currently a limited amount of dogs.

The United Kingdom is facing a surging demand for dogs amid the lockdown, which has led to a shortage and even a doubling in price for some popular breeds, The Financial Times reported.

Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, which operates the national register of pedigree dogs, told the newspaper that inquiries for puppies through the club increased 140 percent in April compared with last year, while waiting lists for puppies have increased fourfold.

The report suggests that French Bulldogs are among the most popular breeds right now and that the prices for dogs are ramping up, with numerous canines being trafficked into the country from Europe.

In the meantime, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported a 600 percent increase in visits to its dog fostering pages, as people are trying to find a furry companion.

At the same time, British charities have warned that many dogs might be returned to shelters after the end of the quarantine, as many are not ready to take care of them for a long time, and some will experience difficulties with their puppies when they have to return to work.",fake

LabCorp, the diagnostics company producing the tests, says it will give first access to health care workers and first responders.

With this test, people who are eligible can swab their nose to collect a fluid sample, but they will still need to send it to a lab for testing. Self-sampling sidesteps the need for a clinician to perform the test, reducing their exposure to symptomatic patients. It also frees up more personal protective equipment, which is in short supply. The test costs $119.

People taking this test would swirl a cotton swab just inside their nostril. When clinicians take samples for a COVID-19 test, they stick a swab very deep into a patient’s nose, to where the back of their nose meets the top of their throat. Self-administered nose swabs are just as accurate as those more invasive swabbing methods, according to an analysis done by UnitedHealth Group and the Gates Foundation. The FDA started allowing those types of swabs at the end of March, although the agency said they still had to be done under the supervision of a clinician.

A number of biotech startups have created and tried to market at-home tests over the past month, claiming that they’re able to produce them under rules that allow certified labs to design and distribute their own tests. The FDA, though, had said that any test kit that allows people to collect their own samples at home needed additional authorization. The LabCorp test, produced by its consumer-focused testing brand, Pixel, is the first to secure that authorization. The laboratory portion of its test had already been approved for use, but it still relied on samples collected by health care workers. Like all other COVID-19 tests on the market, the FDA authorized this test under its emergency use rules; it hasn’t gone through the normal approval process.

Around 147,000 COVID-19 tests are reported in the United States each day, which experts say is still far lower than the number of tests needed to bring the outbreak under control.",real

Bank of America has priced a $1 billion corporate bond issue to help fight the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Bloomberg data, it is the first sale from a US financial institution that earmarks all funds raised to mitigating the pandemic.

The bank sold fixed-to-floating rate notes to finance investments that aim to rectify social issues related to coronavirus, a confidential source who was not authorized to speak on the matter told Bloomberg.

The source said the bonds will generate a yield 1.30 percentage points higher than US Treasurys.

The Food Network’s overall ratings in April were up 25 percent over the same month last year, while HGTV was up 22 percent, the Nielsen company said.

Both networks have adjusted programming in reaction to coronavirus shutdowns with more in the works. The Food Network’s Guy Fieri has gotten takeout at some of his favorite dives, and other chefs are exploring how to be creative with what’s in the pantry. HGTV is planning a show where new products are left on the doorway of people and design experts will judge how the family made use of them, said Kathleen Finch, chief lifestyle brand officer for the Discovery-owned networks.

“People are gravitating to our networks and talent because we provide more than entertainment right now,” Finch said.

Stuck-at-home show hosts are also making use of camera equipment lent by their networks. Comic Amy Schumer is making a program that debuts Monday for the Food Network, “Amy Schumer Learns to Cook,” that is being filmed by her nanny, Finch said.

HGTV hit paydirt this month with shows that featured Brad Pitt, Melissa McCarthy and other celebrities improving the living situations for people they know. The network is planning a show that will feature comics sitting around and commenting on episodes of “Househunters,” Finch said.

Amanda Kloots on Instagram wrote late Saturday that Cordero “made it out of surgery alive and is headed to his room to rest and recover.”

Cordero had been treated with blood thinners to help with clotting in his leg, but his doctors had to stop the treatment because it was causing internal bleeding.

“We took him off blood thinners but that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated today,” she said earlier Saturday.

Cordero entered the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on March 31 and has been on a ventilator and unconscious after contracting COVID-19.

His wife has been sending him daily videos of her and their 10-month-old son, Elvis, so he could see them when he woke up, and urging friends and fans to join a daily sing-a-long. A GoFundMe fundraiser has raised over $200,000.

Cordero played a mob soldier with a flair for the dramatic in 2014 in Broadway’s Woody Allen 1994 film adaptation of “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical. He moved to Los Angeles to star in “Rock of Ages.”

The lanky Cordero originated the menacing role of husband Earl opposite his estranged wife, played by Jessie Mueller, in “Waitress” on Broadway, as well as the role of Sonny in Chazz Palminteri’s “A Bronx Tale.”

On the small screen, Cordero appeared in several episodes of “Blue Bloods” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” as well as “Lilyhammer” and he had a role in the film “Going in Style.”

The virus has sickened other Broadway veterans, including the actors Danny Burstein, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Gavin Creel, Aaron Tveit and Laura Bell Bundy as well as composer David Bryan. It has also claimed the life of Tony-winning playwright Terrence McNally.",real

Our planet is home to over 8.7 million species of animals, birds, plants and insects, which all contribute to the wonderful diversity of our shared home.

Over the past few months, the coronavirus scare has pushed humans inside their homes, which has led to magnificent changes in the Earth’s ecosystem and nature. The damaged ozone layer is healing, rivers are running clean and the air feels a bit more fresh and breezy.

When videos and pictures of several animals returning to their age-old habitats began making the rounds on social media, humans began appreciating the beauty of nature even more.

Celebrating the variety of livings beings on planet Earth, the UN celebrates 22 May as the “International Day for Biodiversity”, bringing to light the issues of biodiversity all around the world.

The theme for this year’s #InternationalDayOfBiodiversity is ""Our solutions are in nature"". It stresses the importance of working hand-in-hand with nature for the benefit of all.

Marking the day, netizens turned Twitter into a photo gallery, with stunning pictures of animals, rivers, oceans, and forests scattered all around.

226,555,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21241211/honda-financial-service-workers-shelter-in-place-order-coronavirus-wfh,2020-05-01,Honda is making financial service workers go into the office during the pandemic,"Automakers are letting hundreds of thousands of customers around the country defer loan and lease payments during the pandemic, offering a small bit of financial relief in a dramatically uncertain time. But customers who call Honda of North America to ask for one of these deferrals are likely talking to a representative who’s still working in one of the company’s regional offices, because it’s making many employees come into these offices despite local stay-at-home orders, The Verge has learned.

Honda’s financial services division has told employees across its regional offices that they are considered “essential” workers because the various state orders allow “financial institutions” to continue business as usual. Honda has also cited customer privacy concerns and access to its call center dialing technology when explaining why these employees can’t work from home, according to one of the employees. One employee who had to quarantine themselves was even let go.

Other automakers have told The Verge that their own financial services divisions are working from home with no issues.

Ford, for example, said all of the tech that its customer service center employees use (including call recording, monitoring, routing, and dialer technology) can be accessed from home, and so its financial services employees are no longer in the office. Nissan says its financial service employees are all working remotely using company-issued computers with “standard security protections” including two-factor authentication for “accessing corporate systems and telephony routing systems.”

Toyota says the shift to remote work for financial service employees has “gone quite well”

Toyota has its financial services team working remotely, according to Vince Bray, the company’s national manager of corporate communications. “This is the first large-scale remote deployment of our customer service capabilities, and it’s gone quite well,” he said. General Motors and Volkswagen also told The Verge that all of their financial services employees are working from home.

An employee at Honda’s “Region 1” office in Cypress, California, who spoke with The Verge on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing his job, said Honda has implemented some social distancing measures and increased cleaning over the last month. But he doesn’t feel the company has gone far enough, especially after one of the his coworkers was told to quarantine themselves by their physician for two weeks in March after apparently coming into contact with someone who had COVID-19.

Honda allowed the employee to stay at home, and told the five people who they worked closest with to self-isolate as well. But the quarantined worker was eventually let go after their physician recommended they stay home for an additional week, according to the financial services employee who spoke to The Verge.

The employee who spoke to The Verge says that he and others have felt especially pressured to keep coming into work during the shelter-in-place order because they are technically employed through a temp agency, with a loose promise of being hired on as full-time employees after about a year. And he says management has treated the two sets of workers differently, too, as a few full-time employees were recently allowed to start working from home while the temp agency workers — who make up the majority of the office — still have to come in.

“BYO F,K,S,C” (fork, knife spoon, cup)

Honda has taken some protective measures at this California office. The company has staggered employee schedules, set up new work stations in conference rooms, and handed out longer power cords so that workers can spread out, according to the employee and an internal email viewed by The Verge. Honda has also told workers not to share any food or drink, removed seats and utensils from the break room, and recommended that they “BYO F,K,S,C” (fork, knife spoon, cup), according to the email.

But about 50 of the 100 or so regular employees are still reporting to the office every day, even after an extensive round of company-wide furloughs, he says. They’ve each been given a letter signed by Honda North America senior vice president and general counsel Catherine McEvilly that they’re supposed to show to law enforcement in case they’re stopped on their way to or from work, according to a picture of the letter viewed by The Verge.

“Even with what they’ve done, I still don’t feel really comfortable being there. But I also need a job because I see what everybody else is going through,” the employee said. “I’m just like, okay, hopefully nothing happens.”

For the first few weeks, this employee said, the volume of calls coming in from customers who wanted to defer their loan or lease payments was so great that there was barely time to worry about the risk of being in the office. (Honda said in the email, which was sent in late March, that it had already granted over 67,000 of these extensions.) But the employee said that the call volume dropped dramatically after Honda made it possible for customers to request an extension online, which is something other automakers have done since mid-March.

“I’m just like, okay, hopefully nothing happens.”

An employee at Honda finance’s regional office in Massachusetts, who also spoke to The Verge on the condition of anonymity, said managers there had taken “extreme precaution to make sure [employees] feel comfortable coming in.” This employee said that only about 25 of the 100 or so regular workers were still coming in every day, and that they’re “really” spread out. But, she says it feels like they “definitely aren’t in a safe environment even with these precautions.”

A spokesperson for Honda North America said the company’s “utmost concern is the safety of our associates,” but declined to answer specific questions.

“We continue to adhere to CDC guidelines for social distancing as well as safety measures the company already has in place. Our current average facility occupancy is at approximately 50 percent, with about half of our associates working remotely,” they said. “We are making every effort to offer more remote work opportunities. Additionally, we have prioritized remote work for associates with high risk health conditions and those who are over age 60. Cleaning and disinfection continues throughout each day at all Honda and Acura Financial Services facilities.”

When asked why Honda’s financial services workers need to be in the office when those at other automakers are already working remotely, the spokesperson said: “We think our statement speaks for itself and don’t have anything else to add.”",real
227,1197,https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/5/16/21261008/coronavirus-masks-a-boon-for-crooks-who-hide-their-faces,2020-05-16,Coronavirus masks a boon for crooks who hide their faces,"CHICAGO — The way the FBI tells it, William Rosario Lopez put on a surgical mask and walked into the Connecticut convenience store looking to the world like a typical pandemic-era shopper as he picked up plastic wrap, fruit snacks and a few other items. Then, when the only other customer left, he went to the counter, pulled out a small pistol, pointed it at the clerk and demanded that he open the cash register.

The scene, the FBI contends in a court document, was repeated by Lopez in four other gas station stores over eight days before his April 9 arrest. It underscores a troubling new reality for law enforcement: Masks that have made criminals stand apart long before bandanna-wearing robbers knocked over stagecoaches in the Old West and ski-masked bandits held up banks now allow them to blend in like concerned accountants, nurses and store clerks trying to avoid a deadly virus.

“Criminals, they’re smart and this is a perfect opportunity for them to conceal themselves and blend right in,” said Richard Bell, police chief in the tiny Pennsylvania community of Frackville. He said he knows of seven recent armed robberies in the region where every suspect wore a mask.

Across the United States, masks have become more and more prevalent, first as a voluntary precaution and then as a requirement imposed by governmental agencies and businesses. And people with masks — as well as latex gloves — have found their way into more and more crime reports.

Just how many criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic to commit crimes is impossible to estimate, but law enforcement officials have no doubt the numbers are climbing. Reports are starting to pop up across the United States and in other parts of the world of crimes pulled off in no small part because so many of us are now wearing masks.

In March, two men walked into Aqueduct Racetrack in New York wearing the same kind of surgical masks as many racing fans there and, at gunpoint, robbed three workers of a quarter-million dollars they were moving from gaming machines to a safe. Other robberies involving suspects wearing surgical masks have occurred in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C, and elsewhere in recent weeks.

The problem isn’t limited to robberies. In the troubled Cook County Jail in Chicago, the virus has led to at least nine deaths and sickened hundreds of inmates and correctional officers. Staffers must wear masks and inmates are issued a new one every day — a policy that helped one inmate escape on May 2.

Jahquez Scott, jailed on a gun charge and for violating his bond in a drug case, has tattoos of a small heart on one cheek and what looks like a blood-dripping scar on the other. But when he wore a mask, he posed as Quintin Henderson — who doesn’t have tattoos on his face and was scheduled to be released, authorities said.

Scott made it out, though he was captured a week later.

In addition to rare jailbreaks, the prevalence of masks in society has created other problems for law enforcement. Before life in a pandemic, masked marauders had to free their faces immediately after leaving a bank or store to avoid suspicion once in the general public. But it came with the risk of being photographed and identified through omnipresent surveillance cameras and cellphones.

These days, they can keep the masks on and blend in easily with or without being “captured” in images.

“The video is much less useful if we are unable to see a face,” said Carlos Marquez, a detective division commander in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, in an email.

It’s leaving law enforcement without a crucial crime-solving tool.

“Guys are like, ‘OK, I have to wear a mask, the police are not going to stop me on the way to a crime and back from a crime wearing a mask,’” said Brendan Deenihan, chief of detectives for Chicago Police Department. “Now if you are going to commit a crime you can leave your house with a mask on and drive for an hour.”

With everyone basically incognito, would-be witnesses might not notice someone acting differently, and that would make it harder to get a good description or identification of the suspect, said Eric Nuñez, chief of the Los Alamitos Police Department in Southern California and president of the California Police Chiefs Association.

It’s less likely now that other shoppers would “stare at them, just making mental notes of what they look like,” Nuñez said. “If they look like everybody else walking in, they may not do that at all.”

It’s a real problem for clerks and tellers, such as Tiffany Becker, who manages a Valero convenience store in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, where a number of stores in the area have been robbed by mask-wearing gunmen recently.

“Before I would have called the police because having a mask wasn’t normal. Now it’s normal,” Becker said. “It’s scary because you can’t tell who is safe and who’s not.”

Even when investigators identify suspects, the protective gear makes putting cases together all that much more difficult. The same latex gloves more people are wearing to protect themselves from picking up the virus will mean fewer fingerprints at crime scenes.

“In the past if you did a search warrant and you found surgical masks, that would be highly indicative of something (suspicious),” said FBI Special Agent Lisa MacNamara, who investigated the string of robberies in Connecticut that led to the arrest of Rosario Lopez. “Now everybody has masks or latex gloves.”

But the reverse can also be true.

MacNamara and her team’s investigation was made easier when his alleged accomplice went into the stores “acting as a lookout or ‘casing’ robbery locations.”

The accomplice hadn’t worn a mask.",real

The extension applies to all social distancing guidelines that Bowser had already put in place, meaning that schools and nonessential businesses will stay closed. Bowser said that the city would need to see a continuous two-week decline in hospitalizations and positive tests before considering relaxing measures.

Additionally, Bowser said that D.C. residents must now wear some sort of face covering or mask at hotels and in taxis and rideshares. The city’s Metro system has also requested that riders wear face coverings while using public transit. Last week, Bowser ordered all shoppers at grocery stores in the District to wear face masks.

This is not a story about coronavirus; it’s worse. It is a story about War, Unrestricted War. The Chinese have promised the world Happiness and Harmony, but have instead lost the “Mandate of Heaven” and delivered Hell. A few courageous experts have been right all along and this is a letter of thanks to them — and a note to the Americans who may want to follow. After you see the scale of deception unleashed upon our country and after your emotions calm, please take economic action! China is at war. Are we?

General Robert Spalding, in his book, “Stealth War: How China Took Over While America’s Elite Slept” gives it away in the title. But the stories of deception will send chills up your spine. Up front, the damage from the war is real. “Simply put, 3.4 million US jobs vanished between 2001 and 2017 due to our trade relationship with China….with 75% of the jobs lost in manufacturing.” All of this occurred under the false assumption that this is just “normal free market competition.” How do you adhere to free markets when your competition is communist and does not respect the price system, private property, or the rule of law? Economic elites have no answer. Everyone should know by now that “China welcomes investment, but it won’t let investors take their profits out of the country (China). Chinese companies set up shop all around the world, but the totalitarian CCP (Chinese Communist Party) puts all kinds of limits on foreign companies (USA) growing in China.” Is this the free market system the elites have in mind? Adam Smith knew better.

How has the language and economic logic been so tortured and twisted in China’s favor? Spalding shows how. subtly and effectively. “In 2017, when Chinese president Xi Jinping went to the annual World Economic Forum – the epicenter of globalization – in Davos, Switzerland, he said, ‘We must remain committed to developing global free trade and investment, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation through opening-up, and say no to protectionism.’” It sounds like Xi is adopting the West’s point of view, but here is where the CCP turns the tables, and why its influence is so subtle, cunning, and effective. In Davos, the crowd heard what they wanted to hear, “but when one parses what he (Xi) actually said and what was left unsaid, it becomes clear Xi offered no firm commitment to anything. There is no mention of adhering to international law, no mention of changing monetary policy to allow for the free flow of earnings out of China. To whom is Xi saying ‘no to protectionism?’” Not to China – “everything about economic policy in China is protectionist. He’s saying the West should not be protectionist, because that serves CCP goals. So in fact the leader of China was subtly undermining the laws of free trade and globalization while appearing to agree with them.” This is stealth war. The elites are promised billions in short term profits while their own countries are strategically being destroyed. Spaulding’s book details how we can get America back on track.

Bill Gertz similarly gives the premise away in his title, “Deceiving the Sky, Inside Communist China’s Drive for Global Supremacy.” By 2018, the views of the elites above had finally begun to change. Gertz interviewed Michael Collins, the CIA’s most senior analyst on China. “China has been waging a low-level war against the United States with the overall objective of preserving CCP rule…A country that exploits all avenues of power, licit and illicit, public and private, economic, military, to undermine the standing of your rival relative to your own standing, without resorting to conflict,” he said. Something that would never have been said even 10 years ago.

But this type of war can be every bit as lethal. On January 11, 2007, China launched the KT-1 rocket and obliterated a satellite in orbit, spreading tens of thousands of pieces of high-speed orbiting metal debris that will threaten both manned and unmanned spacecraft for decades to come. “The destruction of an orbiting satellite that day was a twenty-first-century shot heard round the world.” General John Hyten of the U.S. Air Force said it was a “significant wake-up call to our entire military.” The new space/economic/cyber/technology war was now painfully in sight. Every technology imaginable, from navigation to your banking account, runs seamlessly through information relayed by these satellites. The signal was clear: your economic life is no longer safe. PLA General Peng of the Chinese Military Academy stated without irony that this activity “creates happiness for mankind.”

Gertz collects 200 pages of evidence to refute this claim. We all know about the Uighur Camps, Tiananmen Square, the enslavement of Tibet, and organ harvesting. No one is happy in China. But the logic of war runs much deeper.

Xi Jinping, the leader of all Chinese thought and policy, respects three people above all: Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Adolf Hitler. The two he hates most are Deng Xiaoping (the Chinese reformer) and Ronald Reagan, who crushed Soviet Communism. Did you know that the highest-ranking Chinese official to ever offer to defect to the United States was rejected by the Obama administration? “[Then-Vice President Joe] Biden’s office overruled State and Justice Department officials in denying Wang’s asylum request” And as late as 2014, Hillary Clinton states in her own book that, “we agreed to say nothing about the matter and the Chinese were grateful for our discretion.” This action gave up the most important intelligence asset imaginable. The economic rewards to the Biden’s and Clinton’s have been widely documented. The elites win. Americans lose.

Other elites, such as Google, decide to get into China “by secretly agreeing to assist the Beijing government in developing a special search engine, using proprietary algorithms that would assist in censoring content on the internet.” In critique, another hero, Gordon Chang, “views Beijing’s technology control system as a massive digital totalitarian experiment.” The U.S. Big Tech sector is apparently all-in.

Gertz outlines the work of several other heroes who have spent their lives fighting and analyzing “Financial and Economic Warfare with Chinese Characteristics.” Roger W. Robinson Jr. is a veteran financial warrior like no other. His work helped Reagan take down the Soviet economy, and he is now at work on China. He and Kevin Freeman of “Economic War Room” have shown that America spends relatively little fighting this economic war. Economic attacks come in via leveraged derivatives or cyber efforts, and can result in trillions of dollars in losses. Yet, the perpetrators can remain undiscovered. The Chinese currently control parts of our active military thrift savings plan TSP and index funds at Morgan Stanley such as the MSCI index, which is expanding the Chinese share by the day. Many other U.S. financial instruments also fund the Chinese military and weapons systems currently aimed at us. The day will come when Americans demand change and find out that this change will damage their retirement accounts. This is stealth war.

Many other warriors have joined forces in this new economic war. Steve Bannon, Matt Pottinger, Michael Flynn, Michael Pillsbury, and Peter Navarro have all come alongside the most powerful hawk on China in the White House, President Trump. “For Bannon, the new approach to China is to apply Reagan’s strategy toward the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Reagan said in 1988 at a Moscow summit: “Here’s my strategy on the Cold War: We win, they lose.” Trump has made clear that economic security and military policy are two sides of the same national security coin.

I could show that the heroes above were all ridiculed by the sleeping elites and their hired gun typists, but time is short. The most powerful way to validate the work above, which I hope you share, is to show that the Chinese said practically all of the same things themselves back in 1999, in the book Unrestricted Warfare, by Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui — a book written by two PLA senior colonels from the younger generation of Chinese military officers and published by a PLA house in Beijing. They went on to become generals in China, so their writing in 1999 must have been prescient.

Qiao states ""the first rule of Unrestricted Warfare is that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden."" “Warfare which transcends all boundaries and limits, in short: unrestricted warfare….the rules of war may need to be rewritten.” They go on to derisively explain how Uncle Sam’s success on conventional battlefields has led to an American preoccupation with traditional warfare, while the weak do not have to be so constrained.

""Did the special nature of the Gulf War...trigger 'a revolution in military affairs' or not? This is ultimately a question of perspective […] Perhaps because victory was achieved so easily, to this day there are very few people in Uncle Sam's wildly jubilant group that have accurately evaluated the significance of the war.” By “significance,” they mean the undeniable fact that no one can beat Uncle Sam with guns or planes, and that therefore, other types of warfare will commence.

“Whether it be the intrusions of hackers, a major explosion at the World Trade Center, or a bombing attack by bin Laden, all of these greatly exceed the frequency band widths understood by the American military,” they wrote two years before 9/11. “The American military is naturally inadequately prepared to deal with this type of enemy psychologically […] and especially as regards military thinking and the methods of operation derived from this.”

“However, by using the combination method, …a completely different scenario and game can occur,” they continue. “If the attacking side secretly musters large amounts of capital without the enemy nation being aware of this at all and launches a sneak attack against its financial markets, then after causing a financial crisis, buries a computer virus and hacker detachment in the opponent's computer system in advance, while at the same time carrying out a network attack against the enemy so that the civilian electricity network, traffic dispatching network, financial transaction network, telephone communications network, and mass media network are completely paralyzed, this will cause the enemy nation to fall into social panic, street riots, and a political crisis.”

This doesn’t quite match the condition spoken of by Sun Tzu, wherein ""the other army is subdued without fighting."" However, it can be considered to be ""subduing the other army through clever operations.""

I have reviewed and praised the U.S. sources above because, perhaps, Americans want to understand all of the links and transitions above. The Chinese communists certainly do. I told you this story would not be about the coronavirus. It is about war.

252,1628,https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/mexico-pulls-the-plug-on-renewables,2020-05-21,Mexico Pulls the Plug on Renewables,"As Mexico is poised to plunge into its worst recession in recent-memory the leftist president is making cuts and pulling the plug on subsidy dependent intermittent power from wind and solar that has been driving up the cost of electricity for its financially challenged population.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador won the 2018 election by a landslide. His approach to government spending — even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout — might best be compared to that of conservative icons Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.

Recognizing that industrial wind and solar electricity bring little to no value to electrical grids, Mexico is moving to avoid the higher electrical prices experienced by Germany, Denmark, Great Britain, South Australia, California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and other governments that have heavily subsidized their supply of intermittent electricity.

The only things ‘inevitable’ about the ‘transition’ to wind and solar are rocketing electricity prices and unstable power grids. As to the latter, the Mexican government has taken a stand that has sent renewable energy rent seekers into a tailspin.

The Mexican government’s concept, not without merit, is that if you are looking for a reliable electricity supply, then it does not make much sense to rely on the ‘unreliables’. Mexico needs reliable and affordable power, more than ever.

Mexico’s Centro Nacional de Control de Energia (Cenace), which oversees the electrical system, indefinitely suspended critical tests for new intermittent electricity projects as the nation grapples with the spread of the coronavirus.

The stage is now set for yet another legal dispute between Mexico’s government and the intermittent electricity sector, with the Mexican government acting to freeze project connections in a supposed bid to underpin system stability in the COVID-19 era.

While the wind and solar industries seem eager to deliver their peculiar brand of a ‘healthy environment’ for Mexicans, their government appears more inclined to ensure the delivery of affordable electricity as and when Mexicans need it.

Whether you’re a South Australian business owner trying to keep your head above water, a farmer’s wife in Ontario trying to keep your head on your pillow and sleep despite incessant turbine generated low-frequency noise and infrasound or an Eagle just trying to keep its head, you’ve probably formed a pretty strong opinion about the ‘merits’ of subsidized wind electricity.

Oaxaca is a state in southern Mexico that is home to almost two-thirds of Mexico’s wind-power capacity, including the Tehuantepec turbines. Many people in towns with wind parks seem to still favor them, but over time, people have seen less benefits than originally promised. Job opportunities, for example, have fallen short of expectations, locals say. And the touted improvements to roads or schools also have not materialized, overall.

After the trillions spent on industrial wind turbines and solar panels that do not deliver as advertised, the worldwide ecological destruction from the mining of precious minerals leave lands uninhabitable and worthless for plants and trees. Renewable taxpayer handouts have stripped landscapes. Left in the wake of intermittent electricity farms and subsidized biomass-fueled power plants is cynical at best, and mercenary in their ability to destroy nature’s ability to alleviate the coronavirus via cleaner air.

During this global pandemic, dependence on China for rare earth minerals, which solar panels and wind turbines are useless without, makes clean energy a costly proposition.

The environmental destruction that wind turbines create is extraordinary – “building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of plastic.”

Wind and solar also bring little to no value to electrical grids. When the sun does not shine, and the wind does not blow at set speeds it destroys a grid spinning reserve mode, peaking mode, and backup mode. Similarly, in Great Britain Prime Minister Boris Johnson catches coronavirus, and his country struggles with an unstable grid over widespread adoption of renewables for electricity. In the age of COVID-19 there are life and death matters if electricity is hampered for any length of time.

Renewables then make no sense when the entire world is sick. Only using Warren Buffet’s logic does chaotic wind power bring financial wealth when Mr. Buffett said: “We get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That is the only reasons to build them. They don’t make sense without the tax credit.”

What makes the entire notion of relying on chaotically intermittent renewables dangerous is a seminal work by energy expert Robert Bryce titled, “Question of Power: Electricity and Wealth of Nations,” which highlights this startling fact:

“Roughly 3.3 billion people – about 45 percent of all the people on the planet – live in places where per-capita electricity consumption is less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours per year, or less than the amount used by a refrigerator.”

Uncertainty is the one constant the coronavirus has shown. Long-term planning is no longer in vogue – now it is understanding cratering oil prices and a possible Great Depression. If the World does not get back to work soon, trillion-dollar deficits as the new norm, and prosperity taking a backseat to police-state-like shut-ins.

More than 6,000 products come from the derivatives of crude oil, including every part in solar panels and wind turbines. Additionally, renewables cannot produce the critical medical equipment like ultrasound systems, ventilators, CT systems, and X-ray, medicines, masks, gloves, soap and hand sanitizers for hospitals, and protective gear for doctors and nurses. All those products begin from crude oil, or as the Wall Street Journal states – “Big Oil to the Coronavirus Rescue.”

More damning for renewables than endless subsidies or the billions of people needing reliable electricity, is the fact that without the products from petroleum derivatives the coronavirus would rage unchecked.",fake

Dr. Anthony Fauci says staying closed for too long could cause ‘irreparable damage’

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” he told CNBC.

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said during an interview with CNBC’s Meg Tirrell on “Halftime Report.”

He said the U.S. had to institute severe measures because Covid-19 cases were exploding then. “But now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is, to begin to seriously look at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try to get back to some degree of normal.”

However, Fauci also cautioned states against reducing social distancing measures too quickly, adding they must take “very significant precautions.”

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,” he said. “There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.”

Fauci has been criticized in recent days by Republicans, including U.S. lawmakers Rand Paul and Andy Biggs, for making comments appearing to advocate for keeping some businesses closed longer.

Just last week, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned members of Congress that the United States could face even more “suffering and death” from the coronavirus if some states rush to reopen businesses too early.

It could also hinder states “on the road to try to get back to an economic recovery,” he testified at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on May 12. “It would almost turn the clock back rather than going forward. That is my major concern.”

The virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China, less than five months ago, has infected more than 1.5 million people in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. States have started the process of reopening their economies after being shut down for weeks.

In a separate interview with NPR earlier in the day, Fauci said it was “conceivable” that the U.S. could begin to roll out a coronavirus vaccine by December.

He told CNBC that biotech firm Moderna’s vaccine data, released earlier this week, was very encouraging.

Moderna has been fast-tracking work with the National Institutes of Health to develop a vaccine.

On Monday, the company released data from its phase one human trial on its potential vaccine, showing all 45 patients enrolled produced binding antibodies seen at similar levels of people who have recovered from the virus.

The vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies, which researchers believe are important to protect against the virus, for eight of the patients whose data was available so far. Data on neutralizing antibodies for the remaining patients is expected to come out later.

“We still have a long way to go obviously,” Fauci said Friday. “There are so many things that need to be done. We’re going to go quickly into a phase three trial probably in the beginning of the summer, sometime in July.”",fake

But Russian President Vladimir Putin believes there may be more pain ahead.

According to Putin, the virus may once again begin to spread widely from October to November. During a meeting to discuss the epidemiological situation in Russia, he said the country needs to be ready for a second wave later in the year.

Putin added that the removal of the present restrictions in Russia must be guided by science. However, he also asked officials to prepare recommendations for dealing with the consequences of the pandemic, especially the economic repercussions.

“In order to gradually emerge from restrictions with which we still live to a large extent today, we need to think about what the experts here and their colleagues abroad are talking about, that another wave may possibly come in the fall,” Putin warned.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin insisted that he feels obliged to maintain the current lockdown in the capital, including the system of self-isolation and the control of movement using digital passes. Moscow has largely been shut down for almost two months now – since March 29.

Anna Popova, the head of health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, pointed out that the infection curve has been flattening in Russia. She praised the country’s medical system for its handling of the crisis and said the nationwide spread is showing a “clear downward trend.” Putin noted that there are now fewer new positive tests in Moscow, which has borne the brunt of the Russian outbreak.

According to official statistics, a total of 326,448 cases of Covid-19 have been found in Russia, with over half in the Moscow area. The reported death toll is 3,249 with 99,825 people known to have recovered.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday the state is eyeing the first week of June for live pro sports events to be held. Two conditions: the current “trend lines” in the Covid-19 recovery must continue, and games will be played without spectators in attendance.

These plans were echoed by governors in New York and Texas.

“If our professional sports teams can make it work (& be safe) on their end, we’re supportive,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote on Twitter.

California could continue to implement a local approach to sports, as it has done in reopening other sectors. Newsom said the state was working with county health directors, state officials and representatives from all major sports leagues, as well as consulting with California’s pact of western-state governors.

“We’re just talking about the opportunity … to begin the process of organizing around what that may or may not look like,” Newsom said.

The three pro sports teams in Santa Clara County — the 49ers, the San Jose Sharks, and the San Jose Earthquakes — remain in limbo. The county with the strictest guideline in the state is expected to shelter-in-place for at least another two weeks.

The Bay Area’s major league baseball teams — the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics — would open their seasons around July 4 under a proposal that first must gain approval from the players’ union. Spring training, which was suspended about a week before Opening Day, would resume in mid-June, likely in Arizona.

Of course, nothing is certain.

“We’re holding off (comment) until we have a little more info on what this means for baseball,” a San Francisco Giants spokesperson said of Newsom’s green light for pro sports.

While the NBA has been exploring ways to complete its season — it came to an immediate halt March 11 when a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19 — several teams have begun conducting limited workouts at their facilities. The Warriors have not yet done that; they have 17 games remaining in a lost season, According to multiple reports, the league is considering resuming the season in a single site — such as Orlando, Florida or Las Vegas — to limit travel.

The 49ers hope to hold training camp at their Santa Clara facility in two months, a notion that suddenly isn’t nearly the longshot it was a week ago. Richard Sherman, the 49ers’ outspoken and Stanford-educated cornerback, took to Twitter to explain the state’s change in stance.

“Money changes everything,” Sherman wrote. “Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed.”

Money changes everything. Teams started exploring options outside the state and all of a sudden the timeline changed https://t.co/eeAIl8B4bg — Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) May 18, 2020

The 49ers closed their stadium offices and training center in mid-March. The NFL is allowing clubs to reopen their facilities as early as Tuesday for up to 75 employees, while still prohibiting coaches and non-rehabilitating players. State and local governments must permit such openings and teams must meet the NFL’s revised health protocols.

The Sharks’ season remains on hold with the rest of the NHL. A restart would not necessarily assure the last-place Sharks (29-36-5) of playing out their remaining 12 games, including five at home, or joining any reconfigured playoff format.

“Any longer term return-to-play scenarios in our local facilities, whether for this season or next, will be based on the direction and guidance of local health officials,” said Scott Emmert, Sharks vice president of communications.

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, in a virtual town hall hosted last week by the Sharks, dismissed any notion the league will not be able to resume its season and award the Stanley Cup in the coming months. “States are re-opening, cities are re-opening,” Bettman said. “And if we do the right things, I think we’ll be able to finish the season.”",real

The government is likely undercounting the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, and some leaders have not provided enough support to hospitals in need.

As a matter of foreign policy, the United States should strengthen its ties to the Iranian people, while opposing the regime.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the authors.

As the coronavirus spreads throughout Iran, a quiet revolution is simmering, unnoticed in the US media.

The Iranian regime's mishandling of COVID-19 – downplaying it while the government hoarded tests, doing nothing to alleviate the dire medical and economic situation – is the final straw after the massacre of 1,500 protesters in November 2019, and the January shooting of a civilian plane killing 176 people and subsequent cover up. The recent friendly fire mishap in the Gulf of Oman, killing nineteen Iranian sailors, only aggravates the already bad situation.

The regime has united Iranians across social and economic lines in their opposition. In November 2019, the protesters shot in the streets mostly came from the marginalized communities of the urban poor, often forced by water shortages to leave their rural livelihoods.

In January 2020, the streets were filled with enraged Iranians from the middle and upper classes, whose family members and friends were killed when an Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) shot down a passenger jet. Now COVID-19 is afflicting Iranians of all classes across the country, and regime leaders are missing in action, except for persistently lying about the number of dead.

The epic mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic has set the stage for more anger among the Iranian public.

A mishandled pandemic

Twin political and religious decisions contributed to the early spread of the coronavirus.

First, despite their knowledge of the COVID-19 outbreak, the regime made a cynical political move by insisting on holding Parliamentary elections and the public celebrations for the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution before making any public announcements about social distancing. These decisions to hold public events came despite the fact Hassan Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the former Minister of Health, said he warned President Rouhani about the pandemic in December.

After the government's duplicity was known, public outrage exploded on social media, and the current Minister of Health Saeid Namaki revealed that his own objections to this policy had been suppressed. Days before the election Namaki was told that ""It's not right to talk about the coronavirus outbreak before the elections.""

Second, some religious leaders ignored health warnings and kept mosques and other sites open. In the religious city of Qom the decision was made, after cases had been detected, to keep the Fatimah Masumeh shrine open. Mohammad Saeedi, the Supreme Leader's representative in Qom, accused President Trump and the US of trying to shut the city down.

""No one allows the enemy to portray Qom as an unsafe city; defeating Qom is the dream of treacherous Trump and his domestic mercenaries, but this dream will not be realized even in their grave,"" Saeedi said. After all, he reasoned, sick people should come to the shrine, a place of healing.

That argument is hard to beat for black humor, but Iran's famous wit has been working overtime in the age of coronavirus. No one is sacred or spared, least of all clerics. When a cleric maintained that applying ""violet leaf oil"" to the anus could cure coronavirus, Iranians made hundreds of jokes, sharing them on social media.

Mehdi Sabili, the director of an institute that promotes Islamic medicine recommended drinking camel's urine, modelling this behavior in a video that went viral, provoking satire and jokes. This evidently embarrassed the regime. After arresting and interrogating Sabili, the police discredited the ""charlatan"", saying that he had no expertise in any kind of medicine – Islamic or otherwise.

As respect for and confidence in the regime diminish, undermined by its ineptitude and mismanagement, acts of resistance increase. Women have been seen flouting the strict dress code. As a sign of national unity Iranians are singing ""Ey Iran"", an anthem beloved by the Iranian people, and disliked by the regime.

Iranians have been taking steps within their own communities to fill the gap left by their leaders, ensuring that hospitals have adequate supplies and hospital workers are fed. There have been reports of philanthropists, artists, and NGOs providing hospitals and medical staff with masks, gowns, and food. On their own, some factories have converted to producing medical supplies.

Pushback from within the government

The trifecta of misdeeds — mishandling the protests, shooting down the plane, and misleading the public about the virus — by the Iranian regime over the past six months has provoked criticism from members and supporters of the government as well as its opponents.

A report from the country's Parliament released in mid-April estimated Iran's COVID-19 deaths were double the official numbers and cases were many times higher than the official counts at the time.

The numbers in the report would have earned Iran the dubious honor of having the highest number of infections per capita. Even more astonishing than the coronavirus numbers in the report was the fact that the Iranian Parliament directly contradicted the Rouhani administration.



Parliamentarian Bahram Parsaei revealed that the Minister of Interior ignored his advice to postpone the Parliamentary elections. Similarly, the Iranian Health Minister said he had called for a halt to flights to and from China in January. Even though China air travel was officially banned January 31, Mahan Air flights to Beijing continued well into February.

What the US should do now

Where all this will lead is uncertain. Iranians are united more by their disgust with the regime than by a singular vision for the future.

But the trust between the Iranian regime and its citizens has been irrevocably shattered.

This vulnerability of Iran's leaders offers an opportunity for the US to expand its policy to include strengthening connections with the Iranian people, while still opposing the regime.

If sanctions are lifted, the US should ensure that direct medical and financial aid are not diverted by the regime. If they remain in place, the US could still support nongovernmental aid groups that are approved by the Treasury Department's economic sanctions division which give directly to the Iranian people.

The US rightly opposes the five billion dollar ""coronavirus loan"" Iran has requested from the IMF, which likely would be diverted to terrorist groups and foreign proxies. Is it a coincidence that at the same time nearly five billion dollars have ""gone missing"" from Iran's state coffers?

Finally, the US should defend Iranians' human rights, which include the right to clean water and proper sanitation – essential in a country suffering from bad water management – as well as the right to criticize their leaders. Specifically, US leaders (from Congress as well as the White House) could speak out about persecution of minorities, including religious ones, and the abuse and torture of political prisoners.

Now is the perfect time to match opposition to the Iranian regime with support for its people.

FILE PHOTO: A vessel leaves the Orlan oil plattform at Sakhalin-1's off-shore rig at the Chaivo field, some 11 km (7 miles) off the east cost of Sakhalin island October 10, 2006. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin

Lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19, the flu-like infection caused by the virus, have snarled the supply of spare parts and have prevented maintenance workers from doing their job.

Regular repairs are needed to keep wells pumping, pipelines and refineries functioning and ships moving. Without maintenance, the risk of glitches or unplanned outages increases and delays risk driving up the cost of work later - partly because there will be a rush to do maintenance when lockdowns ease, and partly because plants have lost the optimal timing and weather for work during the northern hemisphere spring.

“When the virus and the quarantine measures have been eased and it is safe to get back to work, it doesn’t mean the same work can be done with the same intensity because the weather windows could be missed and that can push maintenance even to the next year,” said Matthew Fitzsimmons, Vice President of the Oilfield Service team at research firm Rystad.

In the meantime, companies which service the oil industry are being hit by the lack of work.

“A lot of service companies are not getting the revenues they had otherwise expected in 2020. That is going to have a huge impact on the health of the service industry,” said Fitzsimmons.

A MAJOR HEADACHE

Oil and gas companies involved in exploration and production spent an average of $80 billion a year on maintenance between 2015 and 2019, according to Rystad.

The industry typically takes advantage of periods of slow demand to do repair work but with oil prices nearly halved since the start of the year, this is no ordinary trough. Companies, many of them lumbered with high debts, are slashing all but the most essential work.

Some units were shut down for maintenance but the work never started according to Amanda Fairfax, downstream oil market analyst at Genscape, a firm that monitors refineries activities with cameras.

“They don’t want either to invest the capital expenditure into the maintenance project or they don’t want to have as many contract workers on sites as the additional influx of workforce might compromise people who have to remain at the refinery as essential personnel,” she said.

A large maintenance programme in Russia’s Far East Sakhalin-2 project faces delays as the firm could not get pre-ordered pieces of machinery, two sources told Reuters.

“There was a major headache with parts manufactured in China. After the coronavirus outbreak there, the supplier told us it couldn’t deliver our order. There are attempts to replace it, but the time has been lost,” an industry source told Reuters.

Sakhalin Energy told Reuters that the company operates according to a long-term maintenance plan, which is being constantly revised.

“All works will be carried out in accordance with up-to-date plans, safety instructions and quarantine measures required by the state authorities,” the company’s representative said in an email.

Its neighbour, Sakhalin-1 project, operated by ExxonMobil (XOM.N), also said earlier this month that it was adjusting the schedule and scope of work at the plant.

“To ensure the safety of our personnel ... we are focusing on those activities, which can be executed safely in the current COVID-19 situation and are essential for our continued economic and operational resilience,” ExxonMobil said.

Reuters has identified nearly a dozen companies whose maintenance and development plans have been affected by lockdowns.

THE ITALIAN CONNECTION

The lockdown in Italy, which has suffered one of the worst virus outbreaks globally, has reverberated across the energy sector because the country is a leading valve manufacturer.

An industry source in Milan told Reuters that until recently less than 10 percent of Italian producers remained active, struggling to supply even strategic valves to overseas clients.

Italy eased its coronavirus lockdown early in May, giving factories the green light to restart production lines.

One energy company in Nigeria said it was hoping to receive valves from its Italian supplier soon as they had been first in line when the shutdown began, the source said. But others are less optimistic.

A maintenance and development operation at an onshore field in Nigeria was delayed for months as the local oil firm could not receive equipment on time, a company source told Reuters.

Oil companies across Nigeria have also struggled to move workers to where they are needed due to lockdowns that vary by state, and regulations from the petroleum regulator limiting the number of workers at any oil site is also complicating operations. Rivers state, home to the oil hub of Port Harcourt, is under a lockdown so strict that the governor arrested 22 oil workers who landed there, despite federal government permits allowing them to travel.

The Rivers movement restrictions have also trapped pipes and other needed materials that are needed at oil fields outside the state, industry sources told Reuters.

Invitro, the chain who conducted the tests, began mass testing for Covid-19 antibodies on May 18, using their entire network, which comprises almost 1,500 medical offices. Each test costs 950 rubles ($13), with an extra 200-300 rubles ($3-4) charged for the process of taking the sample. The company is accepting anyone who wants to be tested, apart from those displaying symptoms of an acute respiratory viral infection.

“A positive result indicating the formation of an immune response was detected in 14% of patients. Moreover, in just the first four days, more than 40,000 people were tested for [coronavirus antibodies],” the company’s press service said.

The presence of specific antibodies in the blood serum means a person has already been exposed to an infection and has developed immunity, the company explained.

According to Invitro, 47% of those tested were from Moscow or the Moscow Region, and 14.6% were in the Northwestern Federal District, where Saint Petersburg is located. In the future, Invitro plans to launch a ‘Covid Index’ on its website, which would display data by city, gender, and age.

In their press release, Invitro explained that antibody testing can provide a more reliable indication of the extent of the pandemic.

On May 15, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that the capital city would be rolling out a vast random screening program. According to the mayor, mass testing will enable the government to make more informed decisions about anti-coronavirus measures.

This appears to be happening with the new coronavirus.

Reflect On: How do events like 9/11, and the new coronavirus impact human consciousness?

It’s truly an exciting time to be alive, and that’s because more and more people are “waking up” to concepts about our reality and the overall human experience that they were once previously unaware of. This has been happening for decades, but every single year it seems to amplify, and the process of our ‘awakening’ seems to accelerate rapidly.

This type of ‘awakening’ happens in all areas that surround human life. People learn deep truths about health and medicine, education, geopolitics, consciousness, extraterrestrials and much more. The idea that a small group of corporations and the people that run them have a strong hold on our perception, thoughts, emotions, and reactions regarding information and major world events is now far from a mere “conspiracy theory” in the eyes of many. It can be seen quite clearly, and mainstream media has been exposed as the true bearer of “fake news” by many people.

Events like the coronavirus simply accelerate the process of awakening, and expose mainstream media outlets for what they truly are in this moment. There’s a reason why mainstream media has such strong connections to intelligence agencies and have their roots in psychological warfare. You can find documentation and examples of that in an article I published a while ago here.

A quote from Edward Bernays, known as the father of public relations, is powerful because it sums up these thoughts quite well:

The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.

Current Events & Collective Consciousness

When 9/11 happened, we were told that terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre. As the months and years went on, more and more people grew suspicious of their government’s explanation of what happened that day, this included many politicians and academics as well, further adding fuel to the fire. Evidence came forward, science was done and whistleblowers spoke out, giving us a very clear idea that what we were told happened that day, most certainly did not. Today, many polls show that more than half of the American people alone don’t believe the official explanation of what really happened that day. Since 9/11, hundreds of millions of people have become aware of “false flag” terrorism, which is the idea that the ‘powers that be’ created these events, fund terrorism, stage them, and then use these events to justify the infiltration of another country for ulterior motives. They basically create the problem, in several different ways, and then propose the solution.

Organizations like Wikileaks and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have proved, as well as explained, how events like these are used to justify a heightening national security state, one where more and more of our basic rights and freedoms are stripped from us under the guise of ‘goodwill.’

But these events have shifted human consciousness. People become aware of how our world truly works and functions, a process we call ‘Breaking The Illusion‘ here at CE. People begin to see that the world they think is real is actually not, and that things like corruption exist within the geopolitical realm, an important realization if you wish to reflect on whether our political process truly serves us or not. This then changes the perception of people around the world, causing us to choose new paths and actions as to how to live our lives in society. Paths that would not change if we never ‘broke the illusion.’

Another major event is happening right now, the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to COVID-19, what has many people asking questions is the ban and censorship of information. For example, YouTube is now actively banning any content that contradicts anything that the World Health Organization (WHO) states with regards to the new coronavirus. Vimeo recently banned a documentary exposing “Big Pharma’s” influence within the WHO. These blatant forms of censorship have some upset, but many others see it as an eyebrow-raising moment, showing quite clearly the corruption that exists in our world and the efforts that are put forth to control the perception of the masses. We then begin to ask why?

Controlling information and what people think is important if you wish to control their lives. This is why ‘Breaking The Illusion’ is one of the first steps in the CE formula to shift consciousness. After all, why do you think people like Julian Assange are in jail, and people like Edward Snowden are living in exile?

How far have we sunk if telling the truth becomes a crime? How far have we sunk if we prosecute people that expose war crimes for exposing war crimes? How far have we sunk when we no longer prosecute our own war criminals? Because we identify more with them, than we identify with their people that actually expose these crimes. What does that tell about us and about our governments? In a democracy, the power does not belong to the government, but to the people. But the people have to claim it. Secrecy disempowers the people because it prevents them from exercising democratic control, which is precisely why governments want secrecy. Nils Melzer (source)

With COVID-19, we are also seeing a large number of people questioning the measures that multiple governments have taken to lockdown countries. We are seeing people question the information that’s being put out by our federal health agencies, including the World Health Organization. We have seen a number of scientists in the field, as well as doctors, also question the official narratives, and we have seen people like Edward Snowden, and many more, explain how this ‘pandemic’ is being used for ulterior motives. You can access those articles at the end of this article if you’re interested.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, we are now living in a time where a digital authoritarian ‘fact checker’ is patrolling the internet and censoring content it deems as ‘false.’ It does not matter if the information is true or false, backed by science or not, or whether it’s simply an opinion, if it doesn’t align with the mainstream narrative, you are not meant to see it or trust it. Should people not have the right to examine information, check sources, decide for themselves what is real and what is fake?

The Takeaway

COVID-19 has simply accelerated the process of awakening, and it’s also made even more people aware of the censorship of information that’s taking place. Along with the censorship of information, comes ridicule, and bashing by mainstream media in order to oppose and instantaneously shut down any opposite narrative.

Narratives that go against mainstream media narratives are not acknowledged or countered, they are simply ridiculed and deemed a “conspiracy theory.”

The point is, events like this serve the collective. They wake us up, they help us see, they help shift the perceptions about our world and our world ‘leaders’ and serve as a catalyst for more people to start asking questions, and to see that what we are told is not always what is. This is why events as such, although hard in many senses, and real in many ways, do indeed move humanity forward in a ‘positive’ direction. What’s happening now is not a tragedy, it’s exciting, and it’s not as bad as they’ve made it out to be. But again, you can go into that type of discussion and many more, in the articles below.

The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort is scheduled to depart New York City on Thursday after deploying there to help with the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. Northern Command announced on Tuesday that the Comfort, which arrived in Manhattan on March 30, would return to its berth in Norfolk, Va.

Other military personnel, ships, aircraft and facilities will remain involved in the disaster response, and the Comfort itself will continue to stand by.

""Even as USNS Comfort departs NYC, the ship and its embarked medical task force remain prepared for future tasking,"" the statement said. ""The Navy, along with other U.S. Northern Command dedicated forces, remains engaged throughout the nation in support of the broader COVID-19 response.""

There was no immediate information about a prospective second deployment for the Comfort or whether the ship might sail to another destination within the United States or somewhere abroad. The Comfort often undertakes medical missions to the Caribbean, Central American and elsewhere.

The ship's roughly 1,000 patient beds were first to be used as spillover capacity for non-coronavirus sufferers in greater New York, with the idea that they would free up space on land for pandemic victims.

Later, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and public health officials asked that the ship, which had not seen many cases, begin taking suspected pandemic patients, the first of which came aboard on April 6. There was no immediately available accounting about how many total patients the Comfort accommodated during its deployment to New York.

The Comfort's sibling, the West Coast-based hospital ship USNS Mercy, deployed to Los Angeles to help with the pandemic there. The crew of the Mercy also had to try to manage a COVID-19 outbreak among its own personnel.",real

County’s coronavirus death toll tops 2,000","Another 46 Los Angeles County residents have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials announced Thursday, May 21, pushing the county’s death toll above 2,000.

The number of fatalities linked to the coronavirus as of Thursday was 2,016.

“This is a very sad milestone for us. To those of you suffering and grieving,” the county’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Thursday afternoon briefing, “we offer our deepest condolences. We are thinking of you and your families every single day.”

The county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.

The mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city’s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.

Of the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions. County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.

Of all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 39% were Latino, 29% were white, 17% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race.

About 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 have had underlying health conditions.

More than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.

As Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.

Most of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.

“This is very good news, and it shows that what we’re doing over past few weeks — staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings — has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.”

The average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.

“As a community, we’ve done this together,” she said, “and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”

Moving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.

“As we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,” she said. “I know we can do this. Of this I’m certain because we’ve done it. We’ve worked together. We’ve been doing our part, and we’ve saved lives as a result.”",real

Summer camps around the nation are grappling with whether or how they can open this summer, as the pandemic continues. The prospect is especially challenging for overnight camps, where hundreds of kids play, eat and sleep together, and the very idea of social distancing is completely anathema to the camp experience.

Little wonder a growing number of sleepaway camps have already capitulated to COVID-19.

""The cancellation of camp this summer is profoundly disappointing for all of us after what already feels like an eternity of frustration and uncertainty,"" wrote Shannon Donovan-Monti, executive director at Chimney Corners Camp in Western Massachusetts, in an email to parents this week. ""There are no words that can take away the heartbreak of depriving our children and ourselves of something that has given us such joy and connection to others.""

Eleven-year old Maddie Prince was among the many Chimney Corners campers who took it hard. ""It makes me sad that I can't be with my friends,"" she said.

Camp is where she ""grows up more,"" she said, and where she is happiest. ""You don't have any tech and it's really easy to forget all of your worries,"" she added.

""I would argue that kids need camp this summer more than ever before,"" said Dayna Hardin, president of CampGroup, which runs 15 camps from Maine to Michigan, including 13 overnight camps that are still hoping to open. She says the overnight experience might be just what the doctor ordered for kids who have been suffering through months of isolation and anxiety. And she argued that kids may actually be safer from infection at overnight camp than at home.

""We are looking at this like we are the castle,"" Hardin said. ""Our kids are going to enter the castle and we are going to pull up the drawbridge and we will be our own isolated community.""

But a strict ""no in, no out"" policy would certainly crimp camps' style. It would mean no field trips, no visiting days and no socials or sports tournaments with other camps. Staff would have to remain on campus for days off. And laundry and food deliveries would pose challenges.

Camp life inside the ""bubble,"" as some are calling it, would also change. Instead of playing tag, kids would have to fill their time with non-contact activities like making crafts.

""Camp is going to look very different,"" said Matt Fragala, managing principal consultant at Environmental Health & Engineering, the group hired by the American Camp Association (ACA) to recommend best practices and guidelines for camps. Specifics will depend on state and local mandates, but Fragala said recommendations will include constant disinfecting, spreading kids out for sleeping and eating at a distance and in shifts in the dining hall. The goal, Fragala said, is to ""control some of the mayhem the best way we can. It's going to be a change from business as usual at camp. But there's a balance we have to try to meet to keep everybody safe and to minimize potential risk.""

Camps are also expecting to have to split kids up into smaller units, said ACA president and CEO Tom Rosenberg. ""These would be like families where [kids] would be able to socialize somewhat normally,"" he said. ""But between the family circles, there will be physical distancing.""

The same rule would apply to wearing face masks, according to Rosenberg. Campers would wear them when outside their ""family"" group, he said, and staff who interact with more than one ""family"" group, like a food service worker or an archery instructor, would likely have to wear a mask all day.

Camps would be expected to regularly monitor campers and staff for symptoms of COVID-19, for example by taking temperatures every day. But whether camps would test for COVID-19 is an open question. Some camps see testing as a requirement; they won't even consider opening unless they could test kids before and during the session. But other camps say they would not test, relying on taking campers' temperatures daily and watching for other symptoms. That's an approach some parents find irresponsible.

""That keeps me up at night,"" said Fina Barouch, a Boston-area physician and parent of two campers. She said she will not allow her kids to go to camp.

""It only takes one person to be shedding virus when completely asymptomatic, and my concern is that this could turn into something like the nursing home pandemic, where it just spreads exponentially,"" Barouch said.

The CDC has issued its guidance for camps, recommending general precautions like social distancing, screening and extra disinfecting. The agency also directs camps to follow state and local laws, but in most cases camps are still waiting to hear what those will be, and they're growing increasingly frustrated that they don't have more information to help them make their decision.

A few state and local governments have already decided to ban sleepaway camps this summer, including Georgia and Minnesota, and Connecticut is expected to do so. Officials in Vermont have indicated they want to allow overnight camps to open, with extra precautions that are still being worked out. But the vast majority of jurisdictions are still wrestling with the issue.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the issue comes up every day in conversation with other states.

""The tough part,"" he said, ""is figuring out, especially when it comes to some of the stuff that involves the joys of being a kid, figuring out some way to do this, where you have at least enough rules to make sure it can be done safely, but you don't destroy the whole spontaneous nature of what those are supposed to be about.""

Indeed, one camp director said an overnight camp that cuts so many core traditions would be like Disney World without the Magic Kingdom or Mickey Mouse.

Camp consultant Lauren Kasnett Nearpass, co-founder of Summer 365, agrees that if the restrictions become so onerous that camp no longer feels like camp, it may no longer be worth it.

""If you have to remove the magic completely,"" she said, ""if it's going to look and feel so different, then perhaps you know, we just power forward to 2021.""

The prospect of a watered-down camp experience gives pause even to die-hard campers like 15-year-old twins Sasha and Amanda Fine, who were looking forward to the perks and privileges they would enjoy as members of the oldest bunk at their camp this summer.

""Trust me, I want camp more than anyone,"" said Sasha. ""It's just that we can't have camp like this. Like it's taunting us.""

A month ago, Amanda said, her friends were all in favor of going to camp this summer no matter what. But now, she said, rather than a heavily compromised and shortened 2020, most would rather wait and have a ""normal"" summer in 2021.",real

Opioid addiction isn't taking a break during the coronavirus pandemic.

But the U.S. response to the viral crisis is making addiction treatment easier to get.

Under the national emergency declared by the Trump administration in March, the government has suspended a federal law that required patients to have an in-person visit with a physician before they could be prescribed drugs that help quell withdrawal symptoms, such as Suboxone. Patients can now get those prescriptions via a phone call or videoconference with a doctor.

Addiction experts have been calling for that change for years to help expand access for patients in many parts of the country that have shortages of physicians eligible to prescribe these medication-assisted treatments. A federal report in January found that 40% of U.S. counties don't have a single health care provider approved to prescribe buprenorphine, an active ingredient in Suboxone.

A 2018 law called for the new policy, but regulations were never finalized.

""I wish there was another way to get this done besides a pandemic,"" says Dr. David Kan, chief medical officer of Bright Heart Health, a Walnut Creek, Calif., company. It has recently started working with insurers and health providers to help addicted patients get therapy and medications without having to leave their homes. He said he hopes the administration will make the changes permanent after the national emergency ends.

Years before the emergency regulations were issued, Bright Heart — along with several other telemedicine counseling providers — began offering opioid addiction treatment and counseling via telemedicine, even if they couldn't prescribe initial medication for addiction. Patients can renew prescriptions for drugs to deal with withdrawal symptoms, get drug-tested and meet with counselors for therapy.

When Nathan Post needed help overcoming a decade-long drug addiction, he went online in 2018 and used Bright Heart Health to connect to a doctor and weekly individual and group counseling sessions. He says the convenience is a big benefit.

""As an addict, it was easy to have excuses not to do stuff, but this was easy because I could just be in my living room and turn on my computer, so I had no reason to blow it off,"" he says.

Post, 38, a tattoo artist who recently moved from New Mexico to Iowa City, Iowa, was addicted to Suboxone, the drug he was prescribed in 2009 to deal with an addiction to opioid pills.

Officials with the insurer Anthem say Bright Heart's telemedicine option has helped increase medication-assisted treatment for members with opioid drug abuse issues from 16% to more than 30% in California and nine other states. While fewer than 5% of Anthem patients seeking addiction treatment use telemedicine, the company expects the option to become more common.

One barometer of the effectiveness of the care, Bright Heart Health officials say, is that 90% of patients are still in treatment after 30 days and 65% after 90 days — far higher than with traditional treatment.

Several insurers across the country — including Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield companies such as Anthem — have begun covering the telemedicine addiction service.

Dr. Miriam Komaromy, medical director of Boston Medical Center's Grayken Center for Addiction, says there are some downsides to virtual care.

""I think therapists and providers do worry whether it provides the same level of engagement with the patient and whether it's possible to gauge someone's sincerity and level of motivation as easily over a camera as in person,"" she says.

Nonetheless, she predicts telemedicine service will grow because of the tremendous need to broaden access to mental health and addiction counseling. ""Too often the default is no counseling for patients,"" she said. ""This gives us another set of tools.""

Patients can also have trouble finding a doctor who is eligible to prescribe medication to help treat addiction. Physicians are required to get a federal license to prescribe Suboxone and other controlled substances that help patients with opioid addiction, and they can write only limited numbers of prescriptions each month. Many doctors hesitate to seek that qualification.

A few small studies have found that patients are as likely to stay with telemedicine treatment as with in-person care for drug addiction. But no studies have determined whether one type of therapy is more effective.

Telemedicine does have its limits, and it is not right for everyone, particularly patients who require more intensive inpatient care or who lack easy Internet access, Komaromy says.

Premera Blue Cross and Blue Shield officials say they are partnering with Boulder Care, a digital recovery program based in Portland, Ore., to help customers in rural Alaska. ""Telemedicine is a unique way for someone to go through treatment in a discreet manner,"" says Rick Abbott, a Premera vice president.

While telemedicine has been growing in popularity for physical medicine, some people may still be reluctant to use it for drug addiction.

There are also concerns that allowing providers to prescribe controlled substances without meeting patients in person could increase the risk of fraud.

""There is a fear around this that there may be some rogue providers who make a lot of money off addiction and will do it stealthily on the Internet,"" says Dr. Alyson Smith, an addiction medicine specialist with Boulder Care. ""While that is a small risk, we have to compare it to the huge benefit of expanding treatment that will save lives.""

Smith says she doesn't notice a big difference in treating patients for drug addiction in her office compared with on a video screen. She can still see patients' pupils to make sure they are dilated and ask patients about how they are feeling — physical and emotional signs that can help determine whether it's appropriate to prescribe certain drugs. Dilated pupils are a sign of patients suffering from withdrawal from heroin and other drugs.

Dr. Dawn Abriel, who treated Post and previously directed a methadone clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., says she can diagnose patients over video without issue.

""I can pick up an awful lot on the video,"" particularly a patient's body language, she says. ""I think people open up to me more because they are sitting in their homes and in their place of comfort.""

In West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid addiction epidemic, Highmark, a Blue Cross Blue Shield company, started offering telehealth addiction coverage with Bright Heart Health in January. Highmark officials say a lack of health providers, particularly in rural parts of the state, meant that many of the insurer's members had difficulty finding the help they needed.

Dr. Caesar DeLeo, vice president and executive medical director of strategic initiatives for Highmark, says the insurer had been having problems getting customers into care. Only about a third of members with addiction issues were receiving treatment, he says.

""We needed to address the crisis with a new approach,"" DeLeo says. ""This will give people more options and give primary care doctors who do not want to prescribe Suboxone another place to refer patients.""

DeLeo says patients will also be referred to Bright Heart in hospital emergency rooms.

Dr. Paul Leonard, an emergency doctor and medical director for Workit Health, an Ann Arbor, Mich., company offering telemedicine treatment and counseling programs, says many patients who turn to ERs for addiction treatment get little help finding counseling.

With online therapy, patients can sign up while still in the ER.

""We've built a better mousetrap,"" Leonard says.

Providers who specialize in addiction medicine and have recently turned to telemedicine say they and their patients are getting more accustomed to virtual care.

""There are always times you wish you could reach out and hold someone's hand, and you can't do that,"" says Boulder's Smith. ""But we feel like we are more skilled at a virtual hand-holding and really connect with people — and they feel well supported in return.""

330,1312,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-europe-on-the-move-again-by-the-numbers/,2020-05-18,By the numbers: Europe on the move again,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died.

According to StreamElements and Arsenal.gg, the live-streaming sector grew a full 45 percent between March and April; year over year, the industry is up by 99 percent. Which is truly impressive — those gains are directly attributable to the novel coronavirus.

I’ve been writing for a while in these virtual pages about how the ongoing global lockdowns have been a boon to live-streaming platforms; if you’re inside, you’re probably online. And now that many of the experiences we used to enjoy in person have moved to live-streaming — Zoom lectures, Twitch concerts, and fully virtual book launches — the platforms have lately become a culturally important space in the mainstream. It’s meant that more people are watching live-streamed programming than ever.

While there were gains across the board, they weren’t distributed evenly. Twitch — the biggest live-streaming platform — saw the most growth in terms of sheer hours, with its hours watched jumping 50 percent between March and April and a full 101 percent year over year. It’s now up to 1.645 billion hours watched per month.

To focus on Twitch for a moment: the platform’s biggest game in the period surveyed was Valorant, which has anchored its release around Twitch streamers. The site’s “drops” mechanic — wherein viewers had to watch streams to get beta access to the game — drove a full 334 million hours watched on Twitch in April, which made it the biggest category by far on the platform. Next up was Just Chatting, with a very respectable 134 million hours watched in April — bigger than both League of Legends and Fortnite. That’s good news for Twitch because it’s been trying to grow its non-gamer streams. Fortnite got some good news, too: it’s been growing month over month since January, which should maybe put an end to the idea that the game is on its deathbed. But the biggest growth came from the influx of musicians to Twitch. The Music & Performing Arts category on Twitch saw its hours watched quadruple, year over year, because so many acts joined the site to mitigate the impact of lost touring revenue due to the pandemic.

More people are watching live-streamed programming than ever

The other big winner was Facebook Gaming, which saw 72 percent growth between March and April and a massive 238 percent jump in growth over last year. (YouTube Gaming was up by 14 percent from March to April and up by 65 percent year over year. Mixer grew by 15 percent over those same months and 0.2 percent year over year.) The industry’s growth, then, mostly comes from Twitch and YouTube, which are still the two biggest players in the space.

What remains to be seen, of course, is whether these numbers are resilient — whether people will go back to their old viewing habits when this is all over. (Though that doesn’t seem likely for a while.) More than anything, these numbers show just how big live-streaming can be when the industry isn’t competing with real life for your attention. We’re at the beginning of a grand, online experiment, and I can’t wait to see what happens next. Online, I mean.",real

Fast food giant McDonald’s says it will introduce several new safety standards once dine-in rooms reopen to protect customers and workers from the spread of the virus.

The restaurant said it will close some seating and tables to encourage social distancing, and require employees to wear masks and gloves. When eating inside one of McDonald’s restaurants, employees will deliver food to a customer’s table in a double-folded bag.

McDonald’s said it will also clean restaurants more frequently. Play Places will remain closed and restaurants will modify “dine-in beverage procedures” to limit contact. Restaurants will also include signs to advise customers on proper social distancing.

“As our daily routines continue to evolve, we remain committed to safely serving you and our local neighborhoods around the country,” said McDonald’s USA president Joe Erlinger in a statement. ”We look forward to welcoming you back into our dining rooms, when the timing is right and with these extra precautions in place.”

The company said the new procedures will apply to all 14,000 McDonald’s locations in the U.S.

""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in his speech. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge."" Obama and President Donald Trump have traded barbs over how the pandemic has been handled in the past. On a private call with supporters last week, Obama referred to the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic as a ""an absolute chaotic disaster.""

The weekly grocery run may never be the same

1:12 pm ET — The coronavirus pandemic is changing the way Americans go grocery shopping — perhaps forever, say experts. Whether it's sneeze-shields and contactless payment at cashier stations or more online shopping and increased purchases of locally sourced goods, how we stock our refrigerators, freezers and pantries looks a lot different than it did just a few months ago. Food shopping stands ready to change even more, as grocers turn to ever more contact-free automation to get jobs done. Robots are restocking shelves and patrolling store aisles, for example, while newfangled ""dark stores"" are open only for pick-up of online orders. Some of the changes may fade as the coronavirus does, but others will remain. CNBC's Melissa Repko talks to those in the know. — Kenneth Kiesnoski

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Friday, Nurse claimed that he believed that the UK government has not responded effectively to the outbreak of Covid-19.

Nurse - who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2001 – even asked who's really in charge of handling the pandemic, before adding he's uncertain that the British leaders themselves know the answer to that question.

“Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?” he asked. “I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?”

The scientist was particularly critical of Boris Johnson's administration for abandoning mass testing at an early stage of the outbreak, which meant that hospitals became “potentially unsafe spaces” as many asymptomatic staff and patients would have been infectious without knowing it. He did, however, praise frontline workers, comparing their bravery to that of “lions”.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis responded to Nurse's criticism in the same radio show, arguing that the government has been “very transparent” with people and insisting that they've been following “the best scientific advice out there” about tackling coronavirus.

PM Johnson has been heavily criticized by scientists and the opposition since the start of the pandemic for drastic PPE shortages across the NHS, as well as a lack of mass testing during the early stages, although the government maintains that it acted assuming a probable worst case scenario.

The mayor’s “hyper-local, data-informed” strategy will be focused, at least initially, on three hard-hit neighborhoods: Austin, Auburn-Gresham and South Shore.

The unprecedented outreach by Lightfoot’s so-called “racial equity rapid response teams” includes expanded testing and free distribution of 60,000 masks, 80,000 door hangers and 150,000 postcards.

The goal is to “pro-actively reach” African Americans at greatest risk of contracting the coronavirus because of their age, their underlying health conditions or the fact that they are “essential” employees who cannot afford to stay safe at home.

To spread the message, the city is holding three, 90-minute telephone town hall meetings, one in each of the targeted neighborhoods. South Shore is first — on Thursday from 4:30 to 6 p.m. — followed by Auburn Gresham from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Saturday and Austin from 12:30 to 2 p.m.

Targeted public service announcements on radio and television are also planned, once again using comedy as an education vehicle. And rapid response teams operating out of the city’s emergency operations center are talking about “solutions to food insecurity” on the South Side.

When Lightfoot first sounded the alarm about the racial disparity, Africans Americans who comprise 30 percent of Chicago’s population made up 72 percent of COVID-19 deaths.

Now it’s down to a still-alarming 60% — that’s 287 of Chicago’s 500 deaths, according to Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady.

The death rate among African Americans in Chicago remains four times higher than it is for whites, the commissioner said.

For a mayor who declared war on poverty before the pandemic, that is simply unacceptable.

“The health disparities that result in high rates of diabetes, heart and respiratory disease are the very conditions that this virus ruthlessly attacks,” the mayor told a City Hall news conference.

Lightfoot said the maps of coronavirus cases concentrated in black neighborhood “illuminated the broken and racist system of inequality that has held these same communities in the grip of poverty for generations” in Chicago.

“That has withheld access to health care, jobs and education. … The very issues that placed incredible burdens on our families before this crisis have only grown exponentially during this crisis — and thrust into high relief how the issues of equity and opportunity are truly matters of life and death,” she said.

“We simply will not stand for that here in Chicago. Not anymore.”

Carlos Nelson, CEO of the Greater Auburn Gresham Development Corporation, said he’s spent the last 3.5 years planning a 60,000-square-foot regional health and wellness center anchored by a full-service health center at 79th and Halsted streets.

“We purchased the building. We’ve had difficulty finding the last of the funds to get this project done. It’s frustrating and it’s sobering to think how many families would have been supported — and possibly lives saved — if we’d been able to stand up this Auburn-Gresham health and wellness center,” Nelson said.

“When this pandemic is over, it is imperative that we as a great community continue to fight other long-standing epidemics — like poverty, like food instability, like little access to health care and other social determinants of health — with the same vigor that we’re fighting right now.”

Darnell Shields, executive director of Austin Coming Together, openly acknowledged that it will be an uphill battle.

“Social determinants of good health are not in our favor. The number of pre-existing health conditions that plague the black community as a result of extreme poverty [and] systemic racism make us more susceptible to the dangers of COVID-19,” Shields said.

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Lightfoot and Arwady were determined to narrow the nine-year gap in life expectancy between black and white Chicagoans.

The so-called “death gap” between people who live downtown compared to parts of the West Side is an even more astounding 16 years.

Her goal now is to “break down silos” of poverty — and establish food delivery systems to impoverished Chicago neighborhoods — in a way that will last long after life in Chicago returns to some semblance of normalcy.",real

The U.K. finally left the European Union on Jan. 31, but it remains in a transition period and has a deadline of end 2020 to set a free-trade deal with the EU. Now, whether Britain would be able to meet that deadline is in question.

For allergy sufferers, a season of worry","HAMBURG, Pa. — The spring breezes of 2020 are carrying more than just tree pollen. There’s a whiff of paranoia in the air.

For millions of seasonal allergy sufferers, the annual onset of watery eyes and scratchy throats is bumping up against the global spread of a new virus that produces its own constellation of respiratory symptoms.

With coronavirus restrictions in place, interactions with nature might be limited to a quick walk through the neighborhood, but it’s not hard to notice spring has sprung — bringing allergy season with it.

Allergy symptoms are likely to increase during the next two to three weeks as pollen counts grow into the thousands, said Leonard Bielory, professor of medicine, allergy, immunology and ophthalmology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.

“If it wasn’t for the cold snap, we’d be having an incredible amount of pollen right now,” Bielory said Monday. “Once it warms up, with the rain we’ve gotten, it’s going to be quite an intense opening season for trees. It’s going to explode.”

That’s causing angst for people who never have had to particularly worry about their hay fever, other than to stock up on antihistamines, decongestants and tissues. Now they’re asking: Are these my allergies? Or something more sinister?

“Everyone is sort of analyzing every sneeze and cough right now,” said Kathy Przywara, who manages an online community of allergy sufferers for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

Never mind the differing symptoms — that sneezing and runny nose, hallmarks of hay fever, are not typically associated with COVID-19, which commonly produces coughing, fever and in more serious cases shortness of breath. Never mind that allergies don’t cause fevers. Allergy sufferers fret that there’s just enough overlap to make them nervous.

Patients with asthma or allergies who cough and experience breathlessness can resolve their symptoms with inhalers or prescription medication.

But if a patient has COVID-19, those solutions won’t work.

Many garden-variety hay fever sufferers, of whom there are about 19 million adults in the U.S., are also on heightened alert.

They’re taking their temperatures each day, just in case. They’re hiding their sneezes and sniffles from suspicious colleagues and grossed-out grocery shoppers. They’re commiserating with each other and sharing memes on social media (“I don’t know if I should buy Zyrtec or turn myself in to the CDC”).

Pamela Smelser is reminded of allergy season every time she looks out the window of her home office, where her cherry tree is blooming. Spring came early to Maryland, she said, and lots of people are coughing and sneezing from the pollen.

“You do what you have to do: You take your meds for allergies and stay away from people,” Smelser said. “People get really hinky about coughing right now.”

Though she’s had allergies for years, Smelser, a semi-retired social worker and community college teacher outside Baltimore, admits to being a touch paranoid. She takes her temperature every day because she’s 66 and, well, you can never be too careful.

“I can’t rule out that I have anything,” she said. “That’s the paranoia: You can’t even get a test to say, ‘This is all seasonal allergies.’”

In Pennsylvania, pear trees are budding, red maple are beginning to flower and Leslie Haerer’s allergies are already in full bloom. The 64-year-old retired nurse, who lives about an hour north of Philadelphia, is coping with a scratchy throat, an urge to sneeze and a headache behind the eyes.

As a medical professional, Haerer knows her symptoms are attributable to her allergies. She also knows that other people are “really flipped out about this,” including the scowling family of three who saw her sneeze into her elbow outside a Chinese restaurant and, instead of continuing on to their destination — the pizza shop next door — got in their car and sped away.

“I was like, ‘I’m sorry you missed your pizza,’” Haerer said. “People’s reactions are just over the top.”

In Austin, Texas, where pollen counts are high, Marty Watson initially dismissed his itchy eyes, mild headache, coughing and sneezing as the product of a tree allergy, even after his temperature became slightly elevated. Then, in mid-March, he realized he could no longer smell a pungent sourdough starter, and friends began sending him news stories that said a loss of smell sometimes accompanied a coronavirus infection.

”Austin is notorious for all sorts of allergies, and it became really hard to tell: Is it this? Is it that?” said Watson, 52.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

As allergy season ramps up in Pennsylvania, Dr. Laura Fisher, an allergist in Lancaster, expects an influx of worried patients. She is advising them to keep up with their medications, stay at home as much as possible and monitor for symptoms that seem unrelated to their allergies.

“I think people are more afraid of catching it, more afraid of going out and getting it from the grocery store or drive-thru, than they are of their usual symptoms being COVID,” said Fisher, president of the Pennsylvania Allergy and Asthma Association.

Jessica Tanniehill initially blew off her symptoms as allergy-related.

Tanniehill, 39, of Adamsville, Alabama, started with a runny nose and sneezing. Body aches and a cough came next, following by shortness of breath. She thought her seasonal allergies had led to a bout of anxiety, nothing more, especially since she’d been outside all day doing yard work and washing her truck. “I didn’t take it seriously,” she said.

Turns out she’d contracted COVID-19 — which doesn’t preclude the possibility that she’d had allergies as well.

Tanniehill, who’s now on the mend, acknowledged that she “was one of the people that was saying they’re overreacting to all this. But now I wish I was more careful.”

On Friday, Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine and senior medical advisor to Physicians for Human Rights, joined PBS NewsHour’s William Brangham to answer viewers’ questions about COVID-19 and what we know so far.

Should we be wearing masks?

Americans should be covering their faces when they leave the house, but a full mask may not be necessary.

It was announced on Friday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was changing its guidance to recommend everyone cover their faces when outside. The recommendation, however, is voluntary.

But don’t rush to buy N95 respirator masks. In fact, that could be detrimental to curbing the outbreak, since health care workers across the U.S. have reported shortages of such professional protective equipment.

Wearing a cloth covering like a scarf, bandana or homemade mask, when combined with continued social distancing (avoiding public spaces and maintaining 6 feet between others when outside), ensures sufficient protection and prevents a buying rush on medical-grade masks that are already in dangerously short supply.

“I think it’s important to follow the guidelines as the CDC suggests them,” said Mishori.

That said, Mishori doesn’t want mouth coverings to create a “false sense of security.”

Face coverings, even most masks, only provide some protection, and social distancing should be maintained.

Do I need to disinfect things from outside my home?

Yes, as much as possible.

Mishori recommends that if you err on the side of caution, you could disinfect as many objects you bring into your home as possible.

To be cautious, you should throw clothes worn outside into the wash once you enter your home. After purchasing groceries, it would also be prudent to wash them before putting them away.

“I think this virus is very insidious and the virus has shown itself to be very powerful in terms of how it’s spreading,” she said.

She recommends these steps especially for homes where a family member may be particularly vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.

However, Mishori believes takeout food is fine, and you can reheat it if you’re concerned about contamination.

“I wouldn’t worry too much about it,” she said.

Is there a cure or vaccine available?

Medical experts are working as fast as possible, but there’s a lot of work still to be done.

The virus has proven difficult to understand, largely due to its novelty.

One promising area of study is in the very antibodies created by patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Antibodies are our body’s defense against specific infections, developing in direct response to exposure.

Research on this is still in the initial phases, but studying the way our own bodies combat the virus can deliver critical insight into developing a vaccine.

Mishori also addressed certain treatments that some claim are beneficial to fighting the virus. Pneumonia vaccines, for instance, do not treat coronavirus, but may be helpful to prevent additional infections that may develop while your immune system is weakened from the virus.

There is no known cure, and any claim of preventive remedies should always be verified by reputable sources.

“Everything should be taken with a grain of salt,” she said.

Mishori concluded by repeating the recommendations of the majority of global medical experts.

“Stay home, wherever you are,” she said. “It just makes good public health sense and you’re going to be better for helping your fellow citizens.”",real
380,930,https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/5/14/21258997/fact-check-downstate-ray-lahood-pritzker-chicago-illinois-covid-19-coronavirus-wrong,2020-05-14,Fact-check: Downstate congressman’s claim about Chicago’s share of Illinois COVID-19 cases is 100% wrong,"Calling for restrictions under the state’s stay-at-home order to be relaxed in his west-central Illinois district, Rep. Darin LaHood claimed Chicago accounts for the vast majority of the state’s COVID-19 cases.

“Peoria is not like Chicago,” LaHood told a CBS affiliate in Peoria. “Ninety-three percent of the cases in the state of Illinois have come from Chicago. … There has to be a tiered system, a more measured and a balanced approach.”

LaHood, a Republican who represents Illinois’ 18th Congressional District, which includes Peoria, made those remarks May 1 after Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker acknowledged some regions may be ready to reopen sooner than others depending on when they pass their peak.

While there’s no doubt major urban centers with large, concentrated populations have seen a higher number of confirmed positive cases, LaHood’s figure for Chicago — where about 20% of the state’s 12.7 million residents reside — seemed improbably high.

On the day he made his claim, the number of cases in Chicago had reached 22,700, about 40% of the state’s 56,000 cases at the time, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Chicago’s share of the total hasn’t varied much in the days since, the same dataset shows. LaHood’s own Peoria County has seen just 148 positive cases.

Debates over how and when to resume different kinds of business and other activities have raged across states as the nation continues to confront both a rising death toll and historic surges in unemployment.

Pritzker has since released a plan to gradually reopen Illinois that divides the state into four regions. None of the counties LaHood represents are included in the same region as Chicago. Some businesses, such as restaurants, would not open anywhere until the end of June at the earliest under the plan. LaHood said it’s “unrealistic” for downstate regions to wait that long.

When we asked LaHood’s office for evidence of his claim, a spokesperson indicated LaHood was referencing an area that included Chicago and the northern part of the state.

“Northern or upstate IL and Chicago, as of last week, accounted for approximately 93% of the cases, and ‘Northern’ was inadvertently left out during the interview,” a spokesman wrote in an email.

Asked if LaHood misspoke when he cited Chicago instead of “upstate” or “northern” Illinois, we got no response.

Had LaHood referred to counties in northern Illinois that include the Chicago metropolitan region, he would have found himself on much firmer ground. The vast majority of the state’s cases have occurred in Cook County and the five counties that surround it: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will. Together, those six counties are home to about two-thirds of Illinois residents but accounted for 90% of the state’s COVID-19 cases as of May 13.

It’s common for residents outside of the Chicago area to refer to the significantly larger and more populous northeastern region collectively as “Chicago,” according to state political experts. But they said the inaccuracy reinforces regional stereotypes.

“If you’re already disposed to think of things as us versus them, then that’s reinforcing that narrative,” said Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois Springfield. “But it’s not precise, it’s not accurate. … If you’re referring to northeastern Illinois, then be specific about what you’re referring to.”

Our ruling

LaHood said 93% of COVID-19 cases in Illinois “have come from Chicago.”

Confirmed cases in Illinois’ largest city account for less than half of the state’s total cases, public health data show. That’s far from the figure LaHood cited during his TV appearance.

LaHood’s spokesperson said he was referring to the northern region of the state more broadly, but experts told us that’s no excuse.

We rate his claim False.

FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

What restrictions are in place? What to expect in Ocean City as beach, boardwalk reopen

One week after reopening:Ocean City packed on sunny Saturday

""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said of the design, which was developed by Revolution Event Design and Production in Baltimore.

A customer will stand in the center of the circular table surrounded by a rubber barrier that keeps them safely separated from other patrons in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The tables sit on wheels that allow them to stay mobile.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had restaurants and bars across Maryland shuttered – with the exception of carryout and delivery service – since mid-March in an effort to curb the virus's spread.

Now that the state has eased into stage one of its gradual Roadmap to Recovery, eateries are itching to one day soon hopefully resume dine-in service.

Fish Tales is providing curbside and carryout service seven days a week and has also put significant distance between its outdoor tables in anticipation of being able to wait on patrons again.

""We've taken this very seriously from the beginning, and we just want to let everyone know what we've done in the interim to make sure that everybody stays safe and Ocean City can stay open,"" Harmon said in a social media video about the measures the establishment has taken.

391,414,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/ceo-says-covid-19-antibody-testing-disaster/,2020-04-23,CEO Says COVID-19 Antibody Testing Is A Disaster,"Severin Schwan the CEO of Roche says that the current state of antibody testing is a disaster, as a large number of potentially inaccurate tests have rapidly entered the market which has been fueled by a very high demand.

Worldwide countries are looking towards serology testing in order to gain a better understanding of whether citizens are developing immunity against COVID-19, but reports detailing high rates of either false positives or false negatives are delaying widespread screening.

“These tests are not worth anything, or have very little use,” Schwan said during an early Wednesday conference call regarding the company’s first-quarter earnings, according to Reuters.

“Some of these companies, I tell you, this is ethically very questionable to get out with this stuff,” he said, adding that Roche analyzed several products currently on the market and found them to be unreliable. “Every kind of amateur could produce an antibody test,” he said. “The two of us could do it overnight in the garage.”

Roche is working on developing its own antibody test which the company says should be set to launch in May. Their test will run using the company’s high throughput Elecsys assay platform and conas line of analysers which the company is working with the FDA to secure an Emergency Use Authorization for, that allows developers to distribute self validated serology testing ahead of an official review.

Roche’s diagnostic chief Thomas Schinecker has offered his view in another interview: “From a technological perspective, with a test using a finger prick, you will never get as good a result as if you take the blood from the vein,” Schinecker said, describing the design of certain antibody and point-of-care tests, which use a simpler testing strip instead of laboratory hardware. “I would take those results with caution.”

So far this year the FDA has fast tracked the emergency authorization of Roche’s molecular test kits for active cases of COVID-19 infection and the sales within this diagnostic division have increased 5% to reach about $3 billion. Overall molecular testing sales have increased by 29% which has been largely driven by this recent outbreak with routine health checks decreasing.

Growth has been reported around the globe with the exception of the Asia Pacific region which had an 11% drop following COVID-19 related shutdowns in China; due to later onset of the outbreak demands in Europe, North America, and Latin America has been less affected in the first quarter. The company says that its supply chain for medicines and tests remains intact and that sales are expected to continue to increase driven by new drugs, diagnostics, and lab hardware.

“In a pandemic, your healthcare infrastructure is stretched,” said Schwan. “I have no doubt in my mind, because now there is such a huge public awareness in countries where it is not working well and that it needs to be upgraded. As far as Roche is concerned, I have no doubt that people will invest more in high-throughput testing systems,” he added. “The countries that had them did extremely well.”

The company is working on developing its own multiple assay as a point of care test for active infections, and they are making strides towards overcoming the trade-offs between accuracy and ability to produce fast results virtually anywhere, says Schinecker.

“We want to make sure we hit the target performance that lives up to the standard we set ourselves,” he said. “You want to make sure it performs as close to a lab test.”

As far as serology testing goes there are still a lot of unknowns about exactly how the body’s production of antibodies will actually translate to immunity to disease or for how long, especially for a novel one such as it is with this outbreak of COVID-19.

“But society has no other chance than to work with these hypotheses,” Schinecker said. “We cannot wait for all the data to be there.”",fake
399,1621,https://europe.infowars.com/nigel-farage-accuses-france-of-escorting-migrant-boats-into-uk/,2020-05-21,Nigel Farage Accuses France of Escorting Migrant Boats Into UK,"Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions shutting down previously-favoured land routes, according to French and British border authorities, there has been a surge in the number of migrants crossing the Channel from France to the UK in small boats despite the perils of currents and low temperatures.

As record numbers of migrants are attempting the perilous sea crossing into the UK in dinghies, the finger of blame has been pointed at France for assisting what has been dubbed an “invasion” of illegals, reports The Times.

The reports came after French border patrol ships were captured on film escorting the small boats packed with migrants crossing the Channel.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage chartered a fishing boat on 20 May to substantiate his accusation that the French navy was escorting illegal migrants into UK waters.

Farage “rescued” over 20 migrants who were floundering in two boats that were taking in water.

Slamming the “invasion,"" he tweeted that it was time to act to put an end to the practice.

Border patrols explain that migrants typically threaten to throw themselves or their children into the water when attempts are made to apprehend the boats to make them turn back.

“HM Coastguard is only concerned with preservation of life, rescuing those in trouble and bringing them safely back to shore, where they will be handed over to the relevant partner emergency services or authorities,” the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that oversaw the rescue on Wednesday was quoted as saying.

French officials said in April there had been 79 attempts by migrants to cross into the UK – more than in any previous month on record, while charity workers at migrant camps on the coast of northern France claim people are particularly desperate to cross into the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In response to accusations that authorities assist the boats with migrants once they had left the beaches, Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union said that the British and French authorities had little other choice.

“The first rule of maritime law is preservation of life… If we or the French intercept in a manner that causes someone to lose their life we will be criticised.”

As the travel restrictions currently in place due to COVID-19 have closed off some of the routes that migrants previously used to reach the UK, such as trucks going through the Channel Tunnel, there has been a tremendous surge in attempts to cross into the country by sea in small boats, with the number of unaccompanied young migrants also spiking.

At the major port of Dover, located in Kent County, the city council's chief executive Roger Gough says if last year they were dealing with around ""230 to 250"" young migrants, the numbers have doubled.

""It's now nearly 470 and new arrivals are coming in all the time,"" he was quoted as saying by AFP.

So far this year, around 1,500 migrants have been detected attempting to cross by boat into the UK, while during the entire 2019 the number was 1,890.

In an attempt to deter more arrivals, Britain has been together with France to send back more migrants arriving by boat.

“We will be doing much more to enforce this whole principle of if you come from a safe country, you will be going back to that safe country,” Home Secretary Priti Patel was cited as saying by LBC on 20 May.

Patel has been negotiating over the past few weeks with French authorities, seeking a deal whereby migrants intercepted crossing the Channel would not be brought to Dover or allowed to step onto UK soil.

Instead, Border Force vessels would return them to French ports, with UK government ministers proposing to extend extra funding to the French for additional forces and equipment along the coast.

Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who sits on the home affairs select committee, was quoted by the outlet as saying there was only one effective method for stopping the flow of crossings into the UK, and that was if migrants who had no convincing legal reasons to stay knew they would be promptly returned to France.

“It would act as a big deterrent,” said Loughton.

Deploring perceived insufficient efforts by the French to deal with the situation, the MP said:

“The French need to beef up their efforts to stop the boats setting out in the first place. They also need to be far more serious about rounding up the people smugglers involved in this.”

""Pete had just got his test results: positive for COVID-19. At the clinic, he was given just one mask. He was so scared of infecting me and his parents, that he insisted on wearing it to talk, even though we were separated by a window.""

— Kasia Strek

After hearing the news of President Trump's ban on travel from Europe to the United States on March 11, photographer Pete Kiehart bought a ticket home to America. He and girlfriend Kasia Strek are typically based in Paris, but she was already stateside working on a documentary project. They decided to meet at his parents' home in North Carolina.

Kiehart was exhausted from the transatlantic flight and took his temperature on his way home from the airport. It was higher than normal, so he called a local clinic. Two days later, he tested positive for COVID-19.

""I was running this fever but I didn't feel particularly feverish,"" Kiehart said. ""Were it not for this crazy time we're in, I probably wouldn't have taken off work.""

Kiehart had mild symptoms of COVID-19 and did not experience the severe respiratory issues that can result in hospitalization. Still, that did little to quell the family's worst fears.

""Right after Pete got the test results, I learned that a friend of a friend had died the day before because of the coronavirus. He was Pete's age,"" Strek said. ""It was very, very scary for me, especially knowing there was absolutely nothing we could do [for him].""

For the next three weeks, Kiehart self-isolated in his childhood bedroom, away from Strek and his parents, who are both older than 65.

To help fight the isolation, he started using his camera to document new daily activities — like taking his temperature and washing dishes in a bleach solution. Photographing was a way to keep himself entertained and part of his instinct as a journalist.

After seeing Kiehart's images, Strek began photographing too. She wanted to preserve the memory of this difficult time together. They would talk to each other through a window since it was the closest they could be physically together while still maintaining a safe barrier.

""I've been trying to express what I didn't know how to say, or I was scared to say, through the images,"" she said.

While Kiehart was sick, Strek was reading stories from around the world on how people were recovering and coping with the coronavirus. She said it had a healing effect for her.

""I had this tiny, naive idea that someone else could also relate to [our experience],"" she said.

Kiehart tracked his fever every day and waited two weeks after his last symptoms to fully reunite with Strek and his parents, per the World Health Organization's guidance. They are both feeling better now that they are physically back together. Photographing their experiences helped Strek and Kiehart feel like their regular selves during this uncertain time.

Editor, Health Impact News

An independent media publisher named “Grace” who goes by reallygraceful on YouTube has produced what is the best documentary on the history of Bill Gates that I have seen so far.

I have never met Grace, and Health Impact News does not necessarily agree with all of her commentary (we don’t necessarily disagree either!), but these 3 short videos, which have been very well produced, come with plenty of references to document the things she is revealing, and we will copy the references here as well, before YouTube removes these videos.

Please contact us if the videos do disappear, and we will provide an alternative platform to view them.

Also, the Social Media tech giants are suppressing much of our traffic these days on places like Facebook, and our emails also are increasingly being blocked, so be sure to read my article about how to use RSS feeds to continue receiving our articles.

South Korea planned to reopen schools on Wednesday. But with a new spike in cases, the country has had to delay school starting by a week and close down all bars and clubs.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

The world is watching the countries that have seen COVID-19 cases peak and decline. As they ease social distancing and get back to work, new outbreaks are complicating their restarts. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul on the situation in South Korea.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: We're standing outside a nightclub in Seoul's Itaewon neighborhood, a hilly district of bars and restaurants that is generally pretty bustling on a weekend evening. There is a red-lettered official notice on the door banning any assembly until further notice. The club is one of five establishments that health authorities say a 29-year-old man visited on the night of May 1 before testing positive for the virus. Over 100 cases have been tied to this cluster, which has spread to other cities and provinces. South Korea had just seen several days without any locally transmitted cases before the new cluster was found. Frustrated residents, like local restaurant worker Park Gye-soon, say business had just begun to pick up.

PARK GYE-SOON: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: We should all be taking precautions to get over this coronavirus fast, she says. And I just can't understand why some people wouldn't cooperate.

Health authorities have cranked up their sophisticated contact tracing system to track down more than 5,500 recent club-goers, and they're using cellphone data to identify more than 10,000 recent visitors to the Itaewon neighborhood and are advising them via text message to get tested for the virus. Jeong Sujin, who works in Itaewon, got the message and called a help hotline.

JEONG SUJIN: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: I said, I work in the neighborhood but I stay inside a building and take precautions, she says. I didn't cross paths with the patients, so should I still get tested? They said it's recommended but not mandatory.

South Korea just adopted looser social distancing guidelines this month that call for less travel, less crowded workspaces and staying home from work in the event of a fever or respiratory symptoms. On Monday the new cluster prompted authorities to put off the reopening of schools for another week. In a speech on Sunday, President Moon Jae-in called for residents to neither relax their vigilance nor give in to fear.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT MOON JAE-IN: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: We should brace for the pandemic's second wave, which many experts are predicting, he said. However, we can't afford to keep waiting until then to return to normal daily lives. Authorities insist that they've already factored new outbreaks into their plans. Moon said authorities can handle them without straining the country's health system.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MOON: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: If we don't let our guard down, he said, our epidemic prevention and quarantine system can fully control and manage the spread of the virus. Despite the new cluster, Moon insisted that South Korea's COVID-19 response has set a new global standard.

The model explores various scenarios under which states reopen, include continuing lockdowns, and a partial reopening. The model also forecasts those scenarios if social distancing rules continue to be adhered to or are relaxed.

For the PWBM forecast, the model considers that states reopen on May 18. All totals are cumulative, and include past positive cases and deaths.

If states fully reopen with no social distancing rules in place, as many as 5.4 million people could test positive for coronavirus. And if states reopen while still practicing measures of social distancing, nearly 4.3 million people are projected to be diagnosed with COVID-19 by the third week of July.

Partially reopening the states with social distancing rules in place would result in nearly 3.2 million positive cases.

The forecast represents a large uptick in positive cases in the United States which currently stands at 1.5 million, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.

And according to the PWBM, the number of deaths would also start to rise as states reopen.

While previous forecasts from the University of Pennsylvania model had projected a death toll as high as 350,000, the new numbers are lower, though still higher than other models.

Even with states under a full lockdown, the model has projected a death toll at just over 156,000, a slight increase from its previous forecasts of 117,000.

The current death toll in the United States stands at nearly 91,000, according to Johns Hopkins.

But while this scenario is grim, it only serves as the baseline as more and more states reopen and others mull when and how to let business and other normal activities resume.

With a partial reopening, the model forecasts, the death toll will rise to 173,000 people. A full reopening would result in 231,000 deaths. If all the states reopened without adhering to social distancing guidance, that number leaps to 293,000.

While these numbers are large, they represent a revision downward from Wharton’s previous forecast of 350,000. They are also much larger than other models.

According to the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model, the current projected death toll stands at roughly 144,000 by Aug. 4.

While the forecasts seem to warn against a full reopening of states, the model does project positive data economically if states reopen.

Keeping states in lockdown with full social distancing in place will cause U.S. GDP to shrink by 10.8% year over year by July 24, but reopening states would save the U.S. from the severe economic losses.

Towards the end of July the model forecasts, if states reopen GDP would decline by 7.7% compared to the year prior. And if social distancing is reduced, GDP would decline by 6.6%.",real

Boris Jonhson has “lost his edge” and may have not yet fully recovered from his case of COVID-19, a senior Tory MP has warned in an interview with The Daily Mail.

The Tory MP reportedly said that in “normal” times, Mr Johnson would have been resting up for longer and taking a slower approach to returning to work after battling with a life-threatening disease.

“Under normal circumstances he [Johnson] would probably have been taking it easier. The guy was close to death… there was pressure on him to come back. People don’t usually come back to the pressure that he has been under. He is back in the firing line, running UK plc with 67 million people and all the problems that he has got.”

The MP, who spoke anonymously, then went on to suggest that there are concerns being raised from within the Conservative Party about the prime minister’s mental stability following his reportedly gruelling battle with COVID-19.

“Boris has lost that edge. You could say Boris, we need you to take a really difficult turn, and he would use his common sense and get out of it. The illness may have had an impact. The spontaneity… I wonder whether mentally he’s not as sharp because he’s been seriously ill,” the MP added.

The comment comes amidst a steady barrage of criticism against the government over its response to the coronavirus outbreak. Particularly, the high rate of deaths in elderly care homes across the UK and the apparent decision to abandon mass testing early on in the pandemic. Critics have also panned the slow establishment of a new testing regime.

Damningly, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse has slammed the UK political establishment over what he characterised as an absence of leadership throughout the crisis by saying that, “the question I’m constantly asking myself is: who is actually in charge of the decisions? Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?”

He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, May 22, that, “I get a sense the UK has been rather too much on the back foot, increasingly playing catch-up, firefighting us through successive crises.”

Yet, it’s not only Boris Johnson’s leadership that the senior Tory MP expressed concern about to The Mail.

The recently elected Labour Party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also a growing cause of concern for Tories who see him as a formidable opponent in parliament.

The senior Tory MP told The Mail that, following a string of well-received performances from Starmer in which he forensically questioned the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, “it is going down well. We need to be careful. Keir is a savvy guy. He can think on his feet.”

The developments come as the UK’s Department of Health figures show that 36,042 Brits have lost their lives after testing positive for coronavirus.",fake

Social distancing requirements could have counterintuitive outcomes, according to one study, which suggests the behavioral changes triggered by social distancing could ultimately worsen the disease outcome and increase the size of the final epidemic

During an epidemic or pandemic, public health officials may enforce social distancing as a method to control the spread of a pathogen. However, at least one study suggests the ultimate changes in contact patterns triggered by social distancing measures could end up having a negative effect on the population and, in some cases, even worsen the outcome of the epidemic.[i]

The practice of social distancing means keeping physical space between yourself and other people outside of your home. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that in order to practice social distancing, you must stay at least six feet (two meters) away from other people, not gather in large groups and avoid crowded places and mass gatherings.[ii]

Click to read the full study.

According to the CDC, ""Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),""[iii] and various levels of social distancing requirements have been enforced around the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as noted by researchers in the Journal of The Royal Society Interface, ""In general, it is hard to predict the effect of preventive measures without using models to guide us.""[iv]

This is particularly true when it comes to accounting for human behavior, which is often assumed to be constant over time by standard epidemic models but, in fact, may be quite dynamic, especially during a public health crisis.

Study Demonstrates Potential Negative Outcomes of Social Distancing

To determine whether social distancing could have unexpected negative outcomes, researchers from Stockholm University in Sweden and the U.K.'s University of Nottingham used epidemic network models and existing real-world networks. The results suggest that social distancing, when conducted at a ""high enough rate"" at the start of an epidemic, may prevent it from occurring.

However, moderate social distancing may worsen the disease outcome both in the initial phase of the outbreak and in terms of the final epidemic size. As an epidemic evolves, people may choose to distance themselves from those they know are infectious. Models suggest that social distancing may even arise spontaneously during an epidemic based on individual choices rather than being centrally imposed.[v]

An individual may then choose to either drop the connection completely or replace (""rewire"") the connection with another individual, perhaps because they desire to maintain a certain number of social connections. This is where many of the negative implications arise, as the study found that:

"" … having individuals who rewire away from infectious neighbors and possibly replace them with new ties may be harmful for the community as a whole. Depending on the network structure of the population, social distancing may in fact increase the epidemic threshold parameter from below to above its threshold value, making a large outbreak possible where without social distancing it was not. We also show that social distancing can increase the final size of the epidemic.""[vi]

While this didn't hold true for all networks, there were both real-world networks and model networks that the researchers found had worse outcomes when social distancing was in place. This means, according to the researchers, that social distancing may have ""counterintuitive consequences for the population-level.""[vii]

Further, they noted, ""Public health interventions that aim at changing individual behavior through social distancing could have adverse consequences,"" using the example of school closures, stating that while such closures reduce social contacts between the children and their schoolmates, some of these contacts may be replaced by contacts outside of the school.

""As our results show, it is not necessarily straightforward what effects such behavior may have at the population level, where much may depend on the disease and population under consideration,"" they noted.[viii]

This echoes a 2012 study published in BMC Public Health, which similarly found that social distancing can backfire, particularly if not done at a ""drastic"" level at the very start of an epidemic, at which point foregoing control and allowing the epidemic to run its course is preferable.[ix]

In some cases, social distancing can contribute to the ""worst outcome,"" according to the BMC Public Health study, when control is attempted but not at the level that suppresses the epidemic:

""If a disease is very highly infectious, social distancing may have no effect, or may require an unfeasibly high degree of caution in order to be effective. In these cases, doing nothing will be a more cost-effective strategy than using social distancing, because the worst-case outcome arises if the control is applied, but the level of caution used is too weak.""[x]

Consequences of Social Distancing Cannot Be Ignored

Aside from its effects on the spread of pathogens, there are adverse consequences of social distancing, like resulting social isolation, that are worthy of attention. At least 13 studies demonstrate that social isolation increases mortality risk, while having fewer social ties may increase your susceptibility to viruses like the common cold.[xi]

Social isolation also increases inflammation in your body,[xii] making you more vulnerable to inflammation-linked chronic diseases like cancer and, ironically, possibly increasing your predisposition to lung infections like pneumonia.[xiii]

It's clear that infectious disease dynamics are complex and only beginning to be understood, and seemingly straightforward ""solutions"" like social distancing do not have straightforward effects. In some cases, it may even worsen, not improve, epidemic outcomes.

It was 8:34 p.m. on March 11.

He celebrated in characteristic fashion, with a yell and double fist-pump, as “Chelsea Dagger” blared.

He had no way of knowing — Hawks teammates would say later they didn’t receive any outside information at either intermission — that the world in which he scored his 21st goal of the season was quickly looking a lot different than the world in which he scored his first 20.

Unlike other disasters of this generation, the coronavirus pandemic did not arrive in an instant. John Lennon’s 1980 death stunned a live television audience on ABC’s “Monday Night Football”; Osama Bin Laden’s 2011 death earned an announcement during an MLB game on ESPN. The emergence of COVID-19 was not nearly as sudden or surprising in any given moment.

But if the pandemic did have a specific arrival point, it was the night of March 11.

In a span of roughly two hours, the NBA went from postponing a game due to a player — Jazz center Rudy Gobert — testing positive for the virus to indefinitely suspending the season.

President Donald Trump announced an unprecedented European travel ban. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson became the first American celebrities to test positive. The ill-fated 2020 NCAA Tournament announced it would play without fans.

And during those same two hours, the Hawks and Sharks played a regular-season NHL game like nothing was happening at all.

As far as the participants in the game knew, nothing was happening.

But the 21,275 fans who packed the United Center that night knew. What began as another typical game day became a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The fans learned the scope of a crisis that ultimately would ban crowds and sports while in a crowd watching sports.

“In the morning, it was not a big deal,” said Andrew Cameron, a student at Joliet Junior College, who was in attendance. “The next day, it was the biggest deal on the planet.”

This month, the Sun-Times interviewed 18 of the fans lucky — or unlucky — enough to be at the game that night.

They sat in the 100 and 300 levels and in suites and boxes. Some are season-ticket holders. Others were attending their first Hawks game of the season, or ever. Many were Chicagoans, but others traveled from Edmonton or northern Wisconsin to attend the game.

Together, they experienced perhaps the strangest Hawks game in history.

Daytime

Susan Leibforth received the text from her sons, both Hawks season-ticket holders, a few days in advance: Would she and her husband, Bill, want their tickets for the Sharks game?

For Bill, in his mid-70s, the answer was no. He already had heard of the health risks of the virus and decided going to a large public gathering wasn’t worth it.

So Leibforth invited her two granddaughters and one of their friends instead.

“I decided I was just going to be very careful,” she said. “I talked to the girls before we went and said, ‘Try not to touch the rails,’ and all the things that were new to us then. And I gave them each a little hand sanitizer.”

Patrick Dennis and his girlfriend, Sarah, then Illinois State seniors, also were sharing hand sanitizer and developing a healthy game plan while driving up Interstate 55.

Months before, Dennis had decided between the Hawks’ March 11 game against the Sharks and the March 13 game against the Senators for a late birthday present, given that both games aligned with his spring break.

He eventually picked the Sharks matchup, a Wednesday night, because of his wariness of Friday traffic in Chicago. It was to be his third NHL game.

“The thought crossed my mind as I was driving up,” Dennis said. “I made my girlfriend hand-sanitize everything, don’t touch your face when we’re in the United Center, don’t get too close to other people if we can — which is kind of a fool’s errand when you’re at a professional sports event.”

As Leibforth and Dennis drove in, Bob Bednarz — a season-ticket holder in Section 331 — sat at dinner with two friends, one a nurse.

“I was asking them, as people in the medical field, ‘What is your opinion [about COVID-19]?’ ” Bednarz said. “And they were like, ‘It’s bad, but as long as you keep good hygiene, you wash your hands and you don’t do anything crazy, it shouldn’t affect your day-to-day life.’ ”

After that dinner conversation, Bednarz went to the United Center reassured, expecting little to come from the coronavirus.

Tracy McGrath, exuberant about receiving last-minute tickets from her boss, felt the same as she waited in security with her boyfriend.

“He did [feel hesitation] and kept bringing it up, and I kept saying, ‘You’re crazy, we’re fine. Just stop. Nothing’s going to happen. It’s fine,’ ” McGrath said. “At the time, I didn’t really grasp it.”

While waiting, she received an email: Her office was closing. She wasn’t to come in Thursday, denying her a chance to thank her boss in person. It was stunning news, but it was just the beginning of a very busy night for her phone.

Meanwhile, inside the arena, Section 333 season-ticket holder Erin Berry ran into her Hawks sales representative and wasn’t quite sure how to behave.

“We joked, ‘Do we shake hands? Do we not shake hands? Is that still allowed?’ ” Berry said, laughing. “I can remember us making a joke about that, and I was like, ‘I literally just washed my hands, it’s fine.’ We shook hands, and I was like, ‘That was still kind of weird.’ ”

Puck drop

The United Center was officially sold out again, marking the building’s 531st consecutive sellout.

But it was a late-arriving crowd, partially because of the early start — 7 instead of 7:30 p.m. because it was NBC Sports Network’s Wednesday night national game — and partially because of the coronavirus.

Cary Jacobs, another longtime season-ticket holder, noticed the difference in his section.

“In fact, there were a lot of people that did not go to that game,” Jacobs said. “The two aisle seats were empty, and at least four of the seats on the other side of me were empty. And then there’s another group in the row in front of me where there’s five or six season-ticket holders ... and only one of them was there.”

That had a big impact on the supply-demand curve in the resale market, which already had been ugly for 2019-20 Hawks tickets because of the team’s struggles.

“Just for kicks, I decided to go online to look at what the ticket prices were at that time, and you could get a ticket basically where we were sitting for $4,” Dennis said. “We had paid $60 for them, and my girlfriend was not terribly happy to hear that.”

Yet the arena eventually filled up, with only slightly more empty seats than usual scattered around during the first period, which ended with a 1-0 Sharks lead.

Then at 8:04, as the second period began, the first domino — in what would become a transformative night for the nation — fell.

“I happened to be checking out my phone on Reddit, and just from looking around there, the first thing I saw happened to be the [Europe] travel ban,” Dennis said. “I turned to my girlfriend, and I was like, ‘Holy crap, this is really getting serious.’ ”

In the plush BMO Harris Club, where Silvia Hernandez was attending her first hockey game with a business group, there was significantly more alarm.

“At that time, we had coworkers — one in Malta, one in the U.K.,” Hernandez said. “We were like, ‘Oh, no. They have to get on the first flight back.’ We were just panicking during the game to figure out what they were going to do.”

At 8:06, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson released a statement about their positive diagnosis. That revelation brought far less direct impact to Hawks fans than the travel ban but arguably even more sentimentality.

“Once Tom Hanks had it, I was like, ‘Oh, anybody can get it,’ ” Hernandez said.

Doomsday

Eight hundred miles southwest, the Thunder-Jazz NBA game had been called off relatively early. It became official at 7:40. The sports world already was paying close attention to the developing situation there.

Several Hawks fans, including Section 306 season-ticket holder Matt Lavieri, mentioned they were among those watching for news out of Oklahoma City.

When the bombshells dropped, they dropped fast and hard.

At 8:27, Gobert tested positive. At 8:30, Patrick Kane gave the Hawks a 2-1 lead. At 8:31, the NBA halted its season. At 8:34, Saad scored.

“I clicked on [an Adrian Wojnarowski tweet], and I thought it was just going to be a trade or something,” Cameron said. “And the tweet says, ‘NBA season suspended.’ And I was just like, ‘Oh, my god.’

“A few seconds after that, Saad scores, and we just sit down and mull over it and think, ‘Is that real? The NBA season is suspended because of coronavirus?’ ”

Across the upper bowl, McGrath’s cellphone erupted with 10 times as much buzzing as when her work closed.

“My phone started blowing up during the game, from Twitter to Facebook to my friends texting me going, ‘Are you OK? What’s happening? Are you leaving the game?’ ” McGrath said.

“You go into it not thinking about anything but the game. But then when my phone starts blowing up and everybody around you is looking at you like you’re crazy, then it starts to hit you that there’s all this happening, and it’s bigger than sports, and it’s bigger than what’s happening right there in that moment.”

The news reverberated through the arena even faster than any contagious disease possibly could.

“It was kind of a ripple,” Dennis said. “You overheard somebody talking about it and thought, ‘There’s no way that’s actually true.’ And you check your phone, and it’s, ‘Oh, crap, it’s actually true.’ ”

“The arena was like up, down, up, down,” said Gary Winthrope, who got free tickets in Section 109 from a hesitant friend. “Everybody was looking at their phone, then looking at the game.”

“It was a little bit surreal where you’re kind of in two places at once,” Bednarz said. “You’re in this environment where everything seems great and you’re celebrating, but at the same time, you’re like, ‘Oh, crap, what’s going to happen?’ ”

At the time, no one in the arena knew if the game would be finished or if the slate of West Coast NHL games scheduled later that night would be played.

On the TV broadcast, NBCSN commentators Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk made no mention of the elephant in the room until the second period ended, when they teased a “major NBA announcement” to be discussed during intermission. Minutes later, Darren Dreger reported that the NHL was crafting a statement.

Finally, at 9:12, the league announced it would defer its decision — which turned out to mirror the NBA’s — to the next day. The Hawks game, already in the third period by then, would finish normally.

That didn’t mean the atmosphere went back to normal, though.

Aftermath

Dominik Kubalik added a cherry onto the Hawks’ dominant 6-2 win with a rocketing slap shot in the final minutes, making him the only rookie to reach the 30-goal mark so far this season.

But many fans already had left by then, either because of the blowout or the pandemic. And those who remained didn’t want to touch each other, making the goal more awkward than celebratory.

“Blackhawks fans, we’re a family. Everybody talks and high-fives after a goal,” Winthrope said. “And after Kubalik’s goal, everyone stood up, but no one was high-fiving. It wasn’t like what it usually is.”

“It was maybe [half] of the people, but a quarter of the reaction,” Dennis said. “It was less of a get-up-and-scream and more of a ‘Yay, maybe this will end soon.’ Because I really do think people were scared.”

“It was a win, but it almost didn’t feel like it,” Lavieri said. “It almost felt like we lost.”

At the final horn, many of those who remained took pictures of the emptying arena or the “Blackhawks Win!” message on the scoreboard, seemingly aware they wouldn’t see either sight again for quite a while.

Indeed, most of the fans interviewed said they felt certain at that point that the NHL soon would pause its own season, or at least switch to holding all games without fans.

“All the conversations I could hear — and the conversation I was having with the person in front of me — were all like, ‘OK, this is probably it for the year,’ ” Jacobs said. “When the game ended, everybody was like, ‘See you next season.’ Once that [NBA] story came out, everybody got the feeling that we wouldn’t be back.”

For those already in the concourses, it was a mad dash to the safety and seclusion of their cars. There was little milling around, socializing or even self-relieving.

“I saw almost nobody in the bathroom after the game because I get the feeling people didn’t want to go somewhere like a public restroom that was so possibly highly contaminated,” Cameron said.

“It’s a postgame tradition for me, no matter who I go with, to walk to the atrium and browse the store and look at the jerseys,” said Justin Ligeski, who attended the game with Cameron. “That was the first time the switch flipped in my head: ‘I can’t do that. I need to go home.’ ”

Bobby Ziegler had it even worse. He’d bought with friends a monthly plan that gave them standing-room tickets to all 11 scheduled Hawks home games in March. But he realized that night they wouldn’t be seeing the final seven.

Plus, he’d ridden the El to the game — a decision he greatly regretted in retrospect.

“I took the Green Line down, and going home, I was very cognizant not to touch anything,” Ziegler said. “I remember my son saying that, in New York, they were already starting to shut the subway down. I was worried if I was going to have to walk home. It was that crazy.”

In the locker room, the Hawks were just starting to find out all that they’d missed.

The NHL had implemented a closed-room policy two days before in response to the coronavirus’ spread, so a shell-shocked Patrick Kane, Duncan Keith and coach Jeremy Colliton were instead escorted one by one to talk to the media.

“I didn’t know anything until just now, seeing it on the TV,” Keith said. “It makes you wonder what’s going to happen, and it really could be something where we’re doing the same thing [as the NBA].”

“I guess things are getting pretty real around here,” Kane added with a nervous chuckle.

Looking back

Monday marked two months since the March 11 Sharks-Hawks game and the night that flipped 2020 on its head.

There hasn’t been any hockey since, and the AHL — fittingly, though coincidentally — commemorated the anniversary by canceling the rest of its season.

The NHL reportedly continues to evaluate dozens of potential resumption scenarios, but none would begin anytime soon and none would involve fans in the building. The United Center, after all, is filled with thousands of pounds of food and couldn’t host a hockey game if it tried.

Many Chicagoans even might be struggling to remember what pre-coronavirus life was like — or how nice it was to have numerous live sporting events to consider attending or watching every night.

But the 21,275 who chose to take in the last game they possibly could have aren’t having any trouble remembering that experience now. They might not forget it for the rest of their lives.

“It’s one of those things where you look back and you’re like, ‘Wow, that could’ve been super risky,’ ” Bednarz said. “Who knows how many people — at the game even — had [coronavirus] or caught it. But what are you going to do about that? It’s crazy to think about.”

“The historical impact that it’ll have for me are just the feelings I had, sitting in that seat, throughout the whole third period,” Ligeski said. “ ‘What am I going to do after this game? What is life going to be like?’ ”

“It’s definitely going to be a ‘Where were you?’ moment,” Winthrope said. “Like a ‘Where were you when O.J. was [acquitted]?’ kind of thing. And now, ‘Where were you when coronavirus hit big?’ I was at a sold-out United Center watching the Blackhawks play. And that’s just so weird to me.”",real

With the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's no-sail order set to expire in late July, cruise lines are starting to consult design experts to ensure passenger safety and minimize risk of infection from coronavirus and other viral outbreaks in the future.

""Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,"" Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said on an earnings call Thursday.

Cleaning a floating petri dish: How is a cruise ship sanitized after a coronavirus outbreak?

""Ships are currently formulating similar plans to address outbreaks of COVID-19, and these plans could also be modified to prevent and respond to other communicable illnesses in the future,"" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY last month.

Norwegian reveals reopening plan: Cruise line will relaunch five ships at a time, estimates 5-6 months before fleet is back up

Most cruise lines haven't revealed concrete plans yet but suggested changes may include revamping dining rooms and other highly trafficked areas to promote social distancing.

However, AMK Architecture & Design, a Greek firm that specializes in hotel and cruise ship interiors and has worked on more than 120 marine-based projects for lines such as Celebrity and Costa, is already working on future strategies.

""The core of the hospitality business – no matter where it is, is essentially the same, and that is to provide guests with the ultimate experience during their stay,"" Anna Koustsoukosta, AMK's principal architect and managing partner, told USA TODAY. ""The cruise industry, however, which is a floating hotel, is a much more difficult and complex application.""

Now another degree of difficulty has been added to the challenge of designing a cruise ship: How do you stop the spread of COVID-19 or other highly contagious viruses in the future? And how do you continue to offer passengers the convenience of a large cruise ship while prioritizing safety?

""Necessity is the mother of invention, and in this period, we need to reinvent how the passenger moves in the ship and interacts with the ship,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Why are cruise ships so high-risk?

Cruise ships squeeze hundreds or thousands of guests into a relatively small space, and megaships play a prominent role in the industry. Royal Caribbean's 1,188-foot Symphony of the Seas, for instance, can accommodate nearly 9,000 passengers and crew.

""Like other close-contact environments, ships may facilitate the transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces,"" Treffiletti said.

Cruises, which have a the-more-the-merrier philosophy, are never a solitary affair. The fun centers around myriad group activities in a nonstop party atmosphere. Sipping cocktails around the pool, filling showrooms for Las Vegas-style revues, dancing, playing games or lining up at the buffet table all offer viruses opportunities to spread.

'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe – and will they change?

But ships are facing a potential new reality in which cruise lines' business model will change: The number of passengers could be restricted – either by the CDC or cruise lines – to ensure physical distancing. If that change happens, the lines will need to look at new ways to generate revenue in addition to creating an environment in which they are ready for onboard emergencies such as a viral outbreak.

What kind of changes are needed?

""The aim is to suggest solutions to reduce the need for touch interaction, make surfaces and frequently-touched points virus resistant and shape the layout of areas of the ship so as to enable safe and at-distant flow of passengers and crew, without sacrificing socializing, which is one of the important ingredients of the cruise,"" said Koustsoukosta.

Dustin Schafer, director of engineers and senior vice president at Henderson Engineering, who is working on strategies to stop viruses in buildings, said similar ideas would apply to cruise ships, where space is at a premium and social distancing is harder.

“Air and surface cleaning becomes even more critical,"" he told USA TODAY. ""As a first-line strategy, I would recommend retrofits to remove required touch points throughout the ships.""

Embarkation and disembarkation areas

The first crowded public area most cruisers encounter is the embarkation area, where passengers check in and present travel documents before boarding their ship. AMK suggests making the following changes to make these areas less of a petri dish:

A ""sanitization gate"" at the embarkation/disembarkation area of the ship to ensure hygiene protocols are followed

Technology to limit or rid cruise ships of check-in lines

Anti-microbial carpets for public areas and cabin corridors

Automatic doors for entrance and exit points to avoid unnecessary touching

Passenger cabins

Koustsoukosta expects that luxury cabins and suites will become first preference for passengers since those rooms provide access to fresh air.

Diamond Princess:A visual guide to the ship that gave rise to 712 COVID-19 cases

Koustsoukosta suggests creating an enclosed space akin to a mudroom just outside the cabin where passengers could place clothing and shoes worn prior to entering their cabin. Crew could also leave food and linens in the event of a quarantine.

Inside the cabin itself, antimicrobial carpets and fabric could be installed and bathrooms could be modified for touch-free operation; shower curtains could be replaced with glass dividers.

Crew cabins

Koutsoukosta and her team haven't forgotten the crew members, who remain on board after passengers have disembarked. And due to the pandemic and complicated rules for repatriating workers to their home countries, there are still employees marooned on ships today waiting to be let off.

""With the well-being and safety of the crew in mind, cabins for the crew members can change in capacity or size so as to allow adequate self-distancing for the living quarters,"" Koutsoukosta said.

""In the cruise industry the number of passengers is closely tied to the number of crew members,"" said Koutsoukosta. ""Now, with the assumption that ships will be sailing with a reduced number of passengers, this will mean that the number of service personnel will be also reduced, as they will have to cater for less people.""

Because of that potential reduction, she imagines that crew cabins that hosted four individuals could be repurposed for two individuals and some cabins could be left unoccupied to be used in case of an emergency.

Dining areas

Dining on ships will likely change, as well. Koutsoukosta said that table sizing and spacing could be altered to ensure safe distancing between passengers and still provide enough room for staff to move about. Dividers could even be used to create separation at times if needed, she added.

The style of dining on board could change, too, including the popular buffet option. Some cruise line officials say that buffets could disappear entirely.

Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, told USA TODAY in an interview that the buffet – a cruise ship mainstay – would probably not be offered anymore.

But Koutsoukosta doesn't necessarily believe buffets need to be eliminated entirely.

""The buffets layout can also change, with more counters as a solution to avoid long queues or even offering table service,"" she said.

Royal Caribbean president and CEO Michael Bayley indicated he thinks buffets can adapt, too.

""We’ve got teams working on every single element of the guest experience and we obviously have a team working on the buffet,"" he said during a Royal Caribbean ""coffee chat"" reported on by CruiseRadio.net.

Theaters

AMK told Cruise Industry News that theaters could be moved outdoors, to start.

""New open-air show theaters and disco areas, with weather-protection options, can give passengers indoor comfort and outdoor relaxation and security,"" Koutsoukosta explained to USA TODAY.

Schafer, the engineer, suggested that cruise lines ""utilize portable UVc lights or potentially fogging systems to sanitize high-occupancy spaces such as dining and entertainment areas."" (Electrostatic sprayers have also been used to disinfect the Diamond Princess and commercial airline cabins.)

Ask the Captain:What are airlines doing to sanitize planes and airports?

Swimming pools

While pools themselves will remain intact, surrounding areas can be reimagined, according to Koutsoukosta.

""To better understand how we can improve the surrounding areas, we must observe how the pools are used and for what function,"" she said.

In that vein, many passengers use the pool areas to tan and go into the pool only to cool themselves, she explained. An updated pool area design could include showers and other water features to provide alternatives and mitigate pool crowding.

""In addition to that, there are thoughts for passengers to book their slots in the pools, which will give them the added comfort of spaciousness,"" she said.

And cabanas could replace sun beds or deck chairs to promote social distancing on pool decks.

She also mentioned that they are evaluating the use of hot tubs.

Medical facilities

Onboard medical facilities also need to be upgraded as ships prepare to relaunch after coronavirus. In fact, Koutsoukosta said she believes they could become a ""differentiator"" as cruise lines compete to woo back customers.

It's likely, she said, that there will be increased space for medical facilities and cabins for medical crew that are separate from the rest of the crew.

""All medical-related facilities can be interlinked, and (at) the same time, isolated from the rest of the ship so as to separate medical operations from the public areas of the ship,"" Koutsoukosta said.

By having medical facilities separated from the rest of the ship, security and safety for doctors, nurses and patients alike would be increased, she explained. All health emergencies could be dealt with securely in one part of the ship while the fun could remain in tact on the rest of the ship.

How soon could these changes be implemented?

Koutsoukosta couldn't provide a timeline for when these safety upgrades might start appearing on cruise ships. She said AMK is currently consulting with one client and in talks with another, neither of which the company is able to identify.

""Anytime from a few weeks to a few months based on the extent to which of the vessels will be modified,"" she estimated. ""Again, after the feasibility studies, it’s a matter of decision by the cruise lines. Everybody right now is more or less testing the waters.""

Del Rio echoed Koutsoukosta's sentiment, predicting that the relaunching cruise ships, including Norwegian's own fleet of 28 ships, will involve trial and error.

""There will be fits and starts, and it will require the implementation of new protocols as we learn what works,"" he said.

Could changes be applied to ships already in service or only new vessels?

Koutsoukosta said it will be easier to implement complex changes to ships that are still on the drawing board or in preliminary stages of construction.

It's a little trickier to alter existing ships.

""There is really a certain limitation to the extent to which one can modify them quickly and in an economically viable way,"" she explained. ""What we try to do with our clients is focus on the vital-few solutions.""

Competition in the cruise industry has always been intense, Koutsoukosta added, and it will remain that way after coronavirus. And while sanitation upgrades aren't as grabby as onboard roller coasters or private islands, they will be necessary to compete.

""The changes that the cruise lines will make to their ships does not only improve their product offering, but it also puts them ahead of their competitors, as physical distancing, and hygiene is the new luxury,"" she said.

The 27-page guide walks through recommendations about how to return to the office, as well as important considerations about which employees might return and when conversations around coming back can begin to happen.

Premise President Jami Doucette told Business Insider the reason to compile the playbook was that the healthcare company itself was facing the question of ""How do we bring our own folks back?""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Premise Health couldn't let some of of its employees work from home.

Premise is the largest operator of onsite clinics in the US, and the company's workers are essential nurses and doctors.

The same was true for some of the company's clients. They're involved in businesses like manufacturing, and continued operating through the coronavirus outbreak, or moved quickly to restart operations as soon as they judged it to be safe.

The realities of the novel coronavirus and how it spreads, especially the fact that there are asymptomatic infections, poses a challenge to employers about how they might go about reopening their worksites or offices in the absence of an effective vaccine.

For Premise President Jami Doucette, a big question he had as an employer himself was, ""How do we bring our own folks back?"" Ideally, one day some or all non-essential workers will be able to come back to the office.

To figure that out, the Premise team developed its own 27-page reopening playbook, drawing from the experience it's had in helping keep its clients' essential employees safe as the pandemic has unfolded in the US.

Premise has shared the playbook with companies, whether they work with them or not.

""Our approach is this it's all hands on deck,"" Doucette said.

In a new video posted on the company’s YouTube channel, Tesla’s engineers show off two versions of the ventilator, a prototype model with its components laid out across a desk, as well as a packaged model that shows how it might look when used by a hospital. Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to build the ventilators last month after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked for the company’s help.

Tesla has been criticized for attempting to invent a new ventilator rather than utilizing an existing design, but the video helps to explain its reasoning. “We wanna use parts that we know really well, we know the reliability of… and they’re available in volume,” one of Tesla’s engineers explains. The company’s ventilator design re-purposes multiple components from its cars, including the Model 3’s infotainment screen and computer, as well as a part used in the Model S’s suspension system. In theory, using these components should help speed up the development and manufacturing process of the machines.

“We wanna use parts that we know really well”

Tesla also isn’t alone in attempting to develop a new ventilator design. Yesterday, The Guardian reported that British firms are pooling resources as they’ve been developing their own ventilator designs. One high profile manufacturer is Dyson, who received an order for 10,000 ventilators from the British government. However, as of yesterday, Dyson’s design is yet to receive regulatory approval from the relevant authorities, according to The Guardian.

In the US, fellow car manufacturers Ford and General Motors have announced plans to make ventilators and other vital equipment for the medical community. Ford is working with GE’s health care division to try and make a “simplified version” of its ventilators, while GM has partnered with Ventec Life Systems to help increase production of its machines.

As well as developing its own ventilator design, Musk says that he’s also purchasing FDA-approved “ventilators” and shipping them to organizations that need them. However, when NYC Health and Hospitals tweeted to thank the CEO for the “essential” equipment, others pointed out that what was pictured were BPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machines, which aren’t as useful for intensive care units, according to The Financial Times.

Musk has faced a wave of criticism for his responses to the novel coronavirus pandemic, which have included downplaying its severity, suggesting in a tweet that children are immune to the virus, and attempting to keep Tesla’s California factory open in violation of a shelter-in-place order.

Despite Musk’s early skepticism about the virus, at least Tesla’s latest video shows that the company’s work on ventilators is progressing.",real

He’s diabetic and she has rheumatoid arthritis, putting them at higher risk of getting sick and dying from the coronavirus.

But since they’re undocumented, they have to keep working — no matter what.

“If we don’t work, we can’t survive. It’s just that simple,” Sandra said.

Hector and Sandra are pushing 50 and have lived in Chicago for nearly 20 years. Both of them work at a warehouse packaging Windex, Clorox disinfecting wipes and other cleaning supplies.

“They’re really busy right now,” Sandra said.

On March 11, the day the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic over the coronavirus, a worker near Sandra on the crowded warehouse assembly line started coughing.

“That worried me,” Sandra said. The rheumatoid arthritis weakens her immune system, she said, “and I already know to stay away from people who feel sick.”

Fearing the worst, she called off work the next week, but her husband still clocked in. The couple makes about $800 a week after taxes, just enough to cover the basics, including the $1,200 monthly rent for the two-bedroom apartment they share with their 13-year-old son.

“We both have to work to make it,” Sandra said. “I’m worried about my health, but what can I do?”

(The Sun-Times agreed not to use the last names of undocumented people quoted in this story.)

One day without work becomes a crisis

There are around 400,000 undocumented immigrants in Illinois. None of them can claim unemployment insurance even if, like Hector and Sandra, they’ve paid into the system for years.

Tax-paying undocumented immigrants were also excluded from receiving $1,200 checks from the federal government in the $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress on Friday. Those checks are reserved for qualified workers with Social Security numbers.

Nearly half of undocumented are uninsured, according to a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care think-tank. That means there’s a high chance many of them who feel sick are still going to work, said Jorge Mujica, an immigrant and labor rights organizer with Arise Chicago.

“There’s no real safety net for undocumented immigrants, not even during a pandemic,” Mujica said. “Most undocumented immigrants don’t have paid time off or sick leave. If they’re sent home, they’re left without an income at all. One day without work for them becomes a crisis.”

Many undocumented immigrants have seen their jobs evaporate in recent weeks.

Maria, 48, worked for nine years as a housekeeper at a downtown hotel before she was fired March 18 along with 20 of her coworkers, most of whom are also undocumented.

“I asked why they were firing us instead of laying us off, but they said they couldn’t give us any more information,” she said.

Maria had health insurance through her housekeeping job, which also covered her three sons and her husband, who works construction. “We all depended on that health insurance,” she said. “Now what are we supposed to do?”

To keep calm, Maria tries to stay off Facebook and watches the news only once a day. But without a job and unsure if she’ll get help from the government, she’s having a hard time keeping her head up.

“It’s really depressing. I want to work, and now I can’t,” she said. “I wasn’t worried that much about the virus. I always took care of myself and bought disinfectant and cleaning supplies. I taught my kids how to wash their hands all the time. But not having a job makes it a lot harder not to panic.”

‘I’m their safety net right now’

As undocumented immigrants feel the pinch, their children are stepping up to keep their households afloat.

Martha Diaz is one of an estimated 35,000 young people in Illinois who have temporary legal status through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The 22-year-old works full time as a digital marketing strategist for an auto parts company in Broadview. She’s also a full-time student in her final year at Dominican University.

Diaz’s classes and her job have moved online, meaning she spends all of her time at her South Side home that she shares with her three siblings and their parents, both of whom are undocumented.

“My dad’s having trouble finding work,” she said. “My mom works with elderly clients as a home health aide but last week they told her not to go in anymore because of the coronavirus.”

“It feels like I’m their safety net right now,” Diaz said. “My parents always told us to save money, so I have some in the bank. But I don’t know if my company will start having to lay off people because there’s no income coming in. I guess we’ll see.”

Revall Burke, 60, a city parking enforcement aide who lived in the 7600 block of South Morgan, died April 1.

On March 17, Burke was assigned to the polling place at Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church, 1460 W. 78th St.

Burke was the first city employee known to have died from the coronavirus, but his name was not made public when Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the death on April 1.

His role as a polling place worker in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood was first reported Monday by Patch.com.

The news reignited the debate about whether Illinois should have proceeded with the primary election after the coronavirus outbreak had been identified as a global pandemic.

At his daily news briefing, Gov. J.B. Pritzker again defended the decision to go forward with the election, saying he had no legal authority under the Illinois Constitution to do otherwise.

“So, I couldn’t shut it down,” Pritzker said, noting he had instead encouraged voters to vote early and vote by mail.

“We were encouraging people not to go to the polls if they could avoid going to the polls, and indeed I think that’s exactly the same, that we need to do even more so when we get to the general election,” the governor said.

He also pointed out the election was held four days before he issued a stay-at-home order, making Illinois the second state in the nation to take that extreme step.

Pritzker’s administration announced Monday that an additional 1,173 cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Illinois along with 74 more deaths. That brings the statewide total to 22,025 cases and 794 deaths.

Jim Allen, spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, said the board is sending letters to all voters and other election workers who may have come in contact with Burke at the polling place to inform them they may have been exposed.

Allen said it is the fourth letter sent from the board in the aftermath of the election warning of specific instances of possible COVID exposure because of a known confirmed case of someone who either worked or voted at a polling place.

The other letters involved the following polling places: Andrew Jackson Language Academy, 1340 W. Harrison, in the 28th Ward; Montclare Senior Residences, 1200 E. 78th St. in the 8th Ward; and William Dever School, 3436 N. Osceola, which hosted precincts from both the 29th and 38th Wards.

Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections, said this is the first report in Illinois of an election worker dying from the coronavirus.

According to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s report of COVID-19 victims, Burke suffered from diabetes and hypertensive arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Ald. David Moore (17th) said Burke’s family had asked him to not discuss his death.

Sara Cunial, who previously sounded the alarm about how Gates has been pushing his vaccine agenda in Africa and India for years, says that this “vaccine criminal” needs to be taken off the streets and dealt with for the protection of humanity. In essence, she declared that he is a threat to human civilization and the safety of children.

Leave it to Italy to be the nation that calls a spade a spade when it comes to the nefarious activities of Bill Gates, who our own media and politicians routinely praise for his alleged “contributions” to “humanitarian” efforts. Not only is Gates a fraud, but he is a proven genocidal maniac who is actively trying to “thin the herd” through mass vaccination.

Gates hates freedom, and even more than that he hates innocent humanity, and particularly precious children whom he sees as nothing more than human guinea pigs to be exploited for financial and political gain. Gates is a dangerous criminal, in other words, and Cunial is right: He needs to go.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how mandatory vaccination is a form of medical rape, and those who engage in forcing vaccines on people are guilty of committing felony assault:

Just say NO to Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines

Keep in mind that as far back as 2015, Italian leaders were actively warning the world that communist China was conducing biological experiments with coronaviruses. A November 2015 broadcast, in fact, showed Chinese scientists meddling with SARS (severe acute respiratory system), a cousin of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It was asked at that time whether such experiments were even necessary, let alone safe. If there was even a small possibility that such viruses might escape into the general public, then such experiments needed to end, was the message being loudly sent.

As for this latest experiment gone wrong, or so it would seem, Cunial gave a resounding seven-minute speech recently claiming that Italy was subjected to a “holy inquisition of false science.” She added that Italy’s lockdowns were completely unnecessary and were only implemented to advance the globalist agenda, which as we know is being largely spearheaded by Gates and his vaccine agenda.

Cunial continues to urge her fellow political leaders to wake up to what is going on and reject it. She warns that any attempt at compulsory vaccination with a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is a deep state plot to consolidate power and control the masses.

“It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls,’ with the help of the so-called ‘guarantor of their rights’ and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse),” Cunial stated as part of her speech, warning about the devastating impacts of all of this on Italy’s, and really the world’s, precious children.

“In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery â involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet. All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known ‘philanthropist and savior of the world’ Bill Gates.”

Cunial’s entire speech is available at this link.

Westminster is introducing the quarantine measures to in a bid to clamp down on the spread of the coronavirus in the UK. A contact tracing app is also being trialled in the Isle of Wight and will be deployed throughout the country in June, should it prove successful.

But has Westminster botched its handling of the coronavirus Pandemic? UKIP Wales Leader Neil Hamilton gave his views on the matter.

Sputnik: Should Westminster have implemented compulsory quarantines for new arrivals into the UK earlier?

Neil Hamilton: Of course, this should have been done right at the very start, it is one thing that as an island, we should be able to guarantee that we are able to control. There are loads of mistakes that have been made by this government since the start of the crisis, and that’s probably the biggest one of the lot.

We’ve still got people arriving in their thousands every day, we don’t know who they are, and there are ones arriving in small boats from across the Channel for example, who are seemingly welcomed with open arms instead of being sent straight back, so it is bizarre.

It’s a complete failure of the government, they have put the country under house arrest virtually, but yet it’s virtually an open door to all comers from around the world if they can get here.

Sputnik: Could Boris Johnson be forced to resign as British Prime Minister if it is deemed that his government has failed to adequately protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic?

Neil Hamilton: It’s the fault of the entire political class; it’s not just Boris Johnson. Yet again, the whole of the political establishment has fallen down on the job, the Labour Party wouldn’t have introduced a quarantine, they want more and more immigrants to come to this country because it adds to the pool of potential voters for their party in the future.

There is no point in looking at either them or the Liberal Democrats, who are crazy globalists as well, so it is a failure of government, and all potential governments at all levels as well, actually. The political system has failed us here in the same way as it failed us for decades over the EU, conventional wisdom isn’t wisdom at all.

Sputnik: Are you in favour of contact tracing?

I think that testing and tracing is something that we should have been doing from the start, but this is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, we know that there is a portion of the population which is vulnerable, but there is almost nobody who is under sixty who has contracted coronavirus and suffered very badly from it, and it is only those with underlying health conditions, who are of any serious risk of dying.

What they should do is target the vulnerable part of the population, and the people connecting with them, whereas this contact tracing is going to apply to the entire population of the country if it is rolled out beyond the Isle of Wight.

There are massive invasions of privacy, and of people’s personal liberty. We are paying far too high a price for the control of an epidemic, which in historical terms; is actually pretty minor.

The Disney show opened in March 2018 and placed among the top five Broadway productions for both gross and attendance over both years it ran, often pulling in over $1 million, and even $2 million a week.

Until now, only shows that were waiting to officially open have announced postponements or cancellations. Disney still has “The Lion King” and “Aladdin” on Broadway and five productions of “Frozen” worldwide.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents 51,000 actors and stage managers, reacted with dismay to the news and urged New York and national politicians to rescue the arts sector.

“Today’s news should be an all hands-on-deck moment for Gov. (Mario) Cuomo, Mayor (Bill) De Blasio and Congress,” said Mary McColl, executive director. “The arts and entertainment sector drives the economy of New York, just like it does in cities and towns across the country. Decisions made in the days and weeks ahead will shape the future of the arts sector for years to come. Public officials at all levels must think much more boldly about supporting the arts or our entire economy will be slower to recover.”

Disney Theatrical gets no corporate subsidy from the Walt Disney Company and its stage shows must be financially self-sustaining.

Although an exact date for performances to resume on Broadway has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Sept. 6.

Broadway performances were suspended on March 12 after Cuomo imposed a ban on gatherings of 500 or more people. There were 31 productions running, including eight new shows in previews and another eight shows in rehearsals preparing for the spring season.

Some shows like an upcoming revival of Neil Simon’s “Plaza Suite” starring Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker, as well as a musical about Michael Jackson, have pushed their production to next year.

Other shows scheduled to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”",real

So far, he's helped tens of thousands of people through his relief efforts, and he has no plans of slowing down.

On Friday, Fieri announced that the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund (RERF), which he started in partnership with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, is awarding 10,000 new grants to restaurant workers.

The foundation has approved 40,000 grants total since launching last month, the celebrity chef revealed in an interview with TMZ Live on Friday.

""I started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing — we gotta do something,"" Fieri said of starting the relief fund.

The ""Mayor of Flavortown"" said the fund has now raised $21.5 million for struggling restaurant industry workers since lockdowns were implemented nationwide less than two months ago.

Fieri said he personally sent video messages to CEOs from PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Uber Eats and other companies to partner with the fund. Celebrities and over 40 big-name brands have also joined the cause, including Food Network, Live Nation, Corona, TikTok and Netflix, among others.

""As long as the money comes in, we're gonna continue to give these grants,"" Fieri said.

A staggering 29 million Americans lost their livelihoods in April as COVID-19 shuttered stores, factories and offices, and canceled events nationwide. With many restaurants and bars across the country closed or limited to take-out service, the restaurant industry has suffered billions of dollars in losses, with no clear path to recovery.

So far, the restaurant employee relief fund has awarded $500 grants to 40,000 applicants. Restaurant workers who have been impacted financially by the pandemic can apply can for a grant on the RERF website. However, due to an ""overwhelming response"" of more than 60,000 applicants, the Fund has temporarily stopped accepting new applications.

Fieri remains hopeful for the future of the industry. ""I think people are gonna be fired up, gung-ho and ready to get out there and visit their restaurants a lot more than they were prior to the pandemic,"" he said.",real

According to this report children, teens, and young adults are at greater risk than what was previously thought according to a recent study.

""The idea that COVID-19 is sparing of young people is just false,"" said study coauthor Lawrence C. Kleinman, professor and vice chair for academic development and chief of the Department of Pediatrics' Division of Population Health, Quality and Implementation Science at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. ""While children are more likely to get very sick if they have other chronic conditions, including obesity, it is important to note that children without chronic illness are also at risk. Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously.""

A study published in JAMA Pediatrics is the first to describe the characteristics of seriously ill COVID-19 pediatric patients within North America, it followed 48 young children and young adults between the ages of being newborn to 21 years of age who were admitted to pediatric ICUs for COVID-19 in Canada and America during March and April 2020. Over 80% of these patients had underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, immune suppression, seizures, or chronic lung disease, of those 40% depended on technological support due to developmental delays or genetic anomalies.

Over 20% of these young patients experienced failure of 2 or more organs systems due to COVID-19, and nearly 40% required either a breathing tube or ventilator. Nearly 33% of the children were still hospitalized due to COVID-19 at the end of the follow up period, with 3 still requiring ventilator support and 1 on life support; and 2 of the children admitted during the 3 week study period lost their battle with this disease.

""This study provides a baseline understanding of the early disease burden of COVID-19 in pediatric patients,"" said Hariprem Rajasekhar, a pediatric intensivist involved in conducting the study at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Department of Pediatrics. ""The findings confirm that this emerging disease was already widespread in March and that it is not universally benign among children.""

The hospital outcomes for children in this study was 4.2% mortality rate for PICU patients with a lower rate for incidences of respiratory failure, compared to a reported 62% among adults admitted to ICUs. Physicians in the New York Metropolitan area are reporting seeing what appears to be a new COVID-19 related syndrome in children.

""Although our data collection for this study has ended, we continue to develop collaborations with colleagues in our region and across the country to try to understand these more severe complications,"" he said, citing concerns such as heart failure and the Kawasaki disease-like condition termed pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome as examples.",fake

These stores found a way to circumvent the threat of Amazon and e-commerce in general by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online.

Analysts say that the narrative has changed now and the pandemic could lead to a permanent shift in customers' shopping habits, putting any retailer without a strong ecommerce offering at greater risk.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the US, a select group of brick and mortar retailers was defying the retail apocalypse and reporting quarter after quarter of strong sales growth, proving that stores still had a place in an increasingly digital world.

While other brick and mortar chains crumbled as Amazon and e-commerce, in general, became more dominant forces, these select stores found a way around to compete by offering an experience that couldn't easily be replicated online. This meant that many of them either didn't need to have an online store at all or at best, only needed to offer a very minimal e-commerce experience for their customers.

TJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Primark, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree are among the retailers who fit into this category. These stores are using deals and discounts and the thrill of a treasure hunt shopping experience to keep customers coming back.

As soon as the pandemic hit, their situation drastically changed, however. Many of these retailers, which had relied almost entirely on in-store sales, saw business dry up almost overnight thanks to enforced store closings and having a limited online offering, or none at all, to fall back on.

In the short term, this has meant an immediate hit on sales but analysts say even as stores begin to reopen, it is the long-term impact of the pandemic that these retailers should be concerned about as it could result in a permanent change in how consumers shop.

Some shoppers might be too scared to go back to stores and will switch to digital options for good, and the lack of any vaccine for COVID-19 means that there is a high chance of a second wave of infection, putting any store without a strong online presence at greater risk in the future.

The narrative has changed

In the past, off-price stores and dollar chains had defended their lack of a strong online presence by highlighting the simplicity of their business model.

""There was some justification in this because online selling adds complexity and cost and can erode margins. The continuous positive results from players like Primark and TJX [the parent company of TJ Maxx] justified their positions,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in an email to Business Insider.

But ""the coronavirus crisis has changed much of this narrative,"" he said. ""In the short term, not being able to transact online has severely damaged brands without an online presence. Their sales have simply faded away and there is no means by which they can capture some of the demand that still exists. Potential customers have also diverted to competitors,"" and ""given the risk of a second wave or even a future pandemic, many of them will likely review their e-commerce needs.""

Photos of lines outside TJ Maxx stores as they reopened in the US this week indicate that some shoppers are more than happy to resume their old shopping ways. But analysts say this won't be true of everyone, and while there might be a short-term burst after weeks of lockdown, many customers will continue to be cautious and avoid stores. If a second wave of infection was to hit later on, and stores were closed again, these retailers are back to square one.

A recent survey conducted by investment bank Jefferies of 500 female shoppers, who had previously shopped at a TJ Maxx or Marshalls store, found that 60% said they would make some change to the percentage of their spending done in stores once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted; 28% said they would spend more on apparel online initially after stores reopened, and around 60% said they would avoid trying on clothes in stores after COVID-19.

Doug Stephens, retail industry expert and founder of website Retail Prophet, said that until we find a vaccine for coronavirus or achieve some level of herd immunity that is long-lasting, we should not expect to return to ""the normal retail landscape"" anytime soon.

""Let's think about the people that are 45-50 and over,"" he said in a recent conversation with Business Insider. ""They are the highest risk group, and if nothing else they are going to be saying to themselves every time they have a need to go to a store: 'Do I really need to go to a store where I am potentially going to have to wear face coverings, be socially distanced, wait in line to get in, wear gloves, use hand sanitizer, or could I just order this online?'

""I really think it is going to come down to that,"" he said.

Retailers without an e-commerce offering risk becoming irrelevant

The pandemic has meant that many more shoppers are testing online services than otherwise would have, becoming more comfortable with this option and possibly more loyal to it. This, in turn, puts extra pressure on those retailers that don't offer e-commerce services and makes them more at risk of becoming ""irrelevant,"" experts say.

""It's certainly possible they will survive,"" Calvin Carter CEO and founder of digital consultancy agency Bottle Rocket, said in an email to Business Insider, referring to these chains with no online stores or with significantly scaled back e-commerce services. ""But they will be irrelevant, which is the beginning of the end for any company in any industry. When you no longer meet your customers where they are and center your offerings around their needs, you immediately become both irrelevant and at risk of disruption from competitors.""

Not all of the e-commerce free or e-commerce light chains are so vulnerable, however, he said. While consumers might look to avoid busy malls and high traffic areas, Carter said that stores in rural areas, for example, are likely to suffer less. This could put a chain such as Dollar General, which mostly has stores in suburban and rural areas, in a stronger position. Dollar General has operated an online store since 2011.

A business model that doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce

For many of these stores, part of the appeal and the reason that they have been able to stave off the threat of Amazon and other e-commerce players for so long is that they offer a shopping experience that is hard to replicate online, which means their business model simply doesn't lend itself well to e-commerce.

In the case of off-price stores and dollar chains, it's the treasure hunt shopping experience and the idea that you won't know what kind of bargains you'll find until you get to the store that keeps customers coming back. Once in the store, these retailers bank on customers spending more than they might have planned; the margins on each item are slim but they make money from customers buying in large quantities.

Meanwhile, as online consumers ""tend to behave substantially more rationally, it is hard to fully replicate the essence of the shopping trip"" online,"" UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School Professor Katrijn Gielens told Business Insider.

There are ways around this, however. Carter suggests that TJ Maxx, or an off-price store of that kind, could consider having digital personal shoppers that help customers to discover items in new ways online, thereby replicating the treasure hunt experience.

Off-price stores also face a separate challenge: the designer brands that they stock generally don't want customers to be able to find deals and discounts on their products online as it devalues the brand.

TJ Maxx, which launched its online store in 2013, circumvents this issue by making it impossible for its customers to search by a brand on its site. But while this might keep vendors happy, it doesn't necessarily make for a slick online shopping experience. Both TJ Maxx and Marshalls reopened their websites this week with a cap on the number of daily orders, provoking a backlash among customers.

Gielens said that rather than use their websites for transactions, these stores could also look at how they could become digital versions of showrooms to give customers a better idea of what they might expect to see in stores to encourage any reticent shoppers that it is well worth their while to make a visit to that store.

""The opposite of showrooming, webrooming, is occurring more and more. Even when you do not necessarily want to push your consumers online, by offering insight into what you have to offer you can persuade them to visit the store,"" she said.

The cost of offering e-commerce services is a major factor for most of these retailers and in some cases, adding this option may ""destroy the very essence of their business model,"" Gielens said. If not carefully implemented, it could completely undermine their reason for their existence, she added.

At some low-cost chains, the cost of shipping and fulfilling the order of an individual item might even exceed the price of that item, making it near impossible to make money from this.

Gielens said these retailers really have two options: to double down on their competitive differentiation, i.e. not having an online store and work hard to keep giving customers a reason to visit (which would also mean making changes to make the shopping experience safer), or to invest in digital options and ""reluctantly admit that they must approach it [retail] in a new and different way.""",real
517,155,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-york-hospitals-utilizing-vitamin-c/,2020-03-25,New York Hospitals Utilizing Vitamin C,"New York State’s largest hospital system is giving high dose intravenous vitamin C treatments to COVID-19 patients based on reports from China of the approach helping patients there, according to the Post.

Pulmonologist and critical care specialists Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, is reporting that his COVID-19 intensive care patients are immediately receiving 1,500 mgs of vitamin C intravenously and are re-administered the exact amounts 3-4 times per day.

Each dose is more than 16 times the national recommended guideline allowances of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult women. This approach is based on experimental treatments and small studies involving coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China; a hospital even made a release about it.

The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:

“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”

“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,” said Weber. “It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”

Jason Molinet who is spokesperson for Northwell states that vitamin C is being “widely used” to treat COVID-19 patients throughout the system, but the treatment protocols vary from patient to patient “as the clinician decides.” Currently about 700 patients are being treated across the hospital network, but Molient was not sure exactly how many were getting vitamin C treatments.

The vitamin C treatments are being administered in addition to other medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and various other biologicals and blood thinners, according to Weber. New York hospitals have been given federal permission to administer a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis.

Vitamin C levels dramatically drop in those with COVID-19 when they experience sepsis, which is an inflammatory response that happens when the body overreacts to the infection. “It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,” says Weber.

Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China is conducting clinical trials on the effectiveness of high dose intravenous vitamin C on COVID-19 patients. One is a randomized triple blind study involving 140 COVID-19 patients, and it is expected to be complete by September, 30, 2020 based on information posted in the National Library of Medicine’s website.

The small French study published last week using the cocktail combination of hydroxychloroquine/Plaquenil and azithromycin/Zithromax showed that 5 out of 6 COVID-19 patients that were treated with the cocktail tested negative on day 3 and all tested negative on day 6. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases cautions that this cocktail has not been proven in clinical trials.",fake

The City Council unanimously approved a fair workweek ordinance last summer that requires large Chicago employers to give employees at least two weeks’ notice of their schedules and compensate them for last-minute changes.

At a virtual meeting Monday, the City’s Council Committee on Workforce Development agreed to ease up a bit to recognize many businesses may not survive the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.

The amendment approved Monday after a rare direct introduction by Mayor Lori Lightfoot would postpone until Jan. 1 the “private cause of action” section that allows aggrieved workers whose schedules are changed without adequate notice or compensation to file their own lawsuits.

“We understand that all businesses are struggling due to the COVID outbreak. This will allow businesses to implement fair workweek policy without fear of lawsuits during the first six months of the regulations,” said Rosa Escareno, Business Affairs and Consumer Protection commissioner.

Escareno stressed the predictable scheduling ordinance will still take effect July 1. “During this pandemic, worker protections are more important than ever before. We owe it to the hundreds of thousands of essential workers that have kept the city running,” Escareno said. “Now is not the time to sacrifice the hard-earned [protections] we have already put in place to support our workers.”

Zoning Committee Chairman Tom Tunney (44th), owner of Ann Sather’s Restaurants, acknowledged the ordinance applies only to businesses with 100 or more employees, restaurants with at least 30 locations and 250 employees globally, and to franchisees with four or more locations.

But Tunney warned of the dangers of imposing the mandate as the Chicago economy slowly reopens under the five-step plans unveiled by the mayor and the governor.

“Our biggest challenge is going to be having a two-week forecast of what demand will be like under what phase. That’s gonna be a very complicated phase-in of employees,” Tunney said.

“It’s just one more disincentive to bring people back. I’m being honest with you. As you phase in, you’re only gonna bring your top, top employees. The least amount that you need to run the business. This, among other things, is going to be a real drag on employment for all workers.”

The anti-retaliation ordinance championed by the mayor and approved by the Workforce Development Committee is tailored to protect workers from being fired, suspended, transferred or having their pay cut because of absences tied to the coronavirus.

The protections would apply to workers who stay home because they have COVID-19 symptoms, have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus, or their business is deemed nonessential by statewide stay-at-home order.

“We wish this ordinance was not necessary. And the fact is that the vast majority of our businesses in Chicago have proven themselves to be good actors and have already offered this protection to their workers. But all Chicago workers should be guaranteed job safety as they do their part to keep our community safe,” Escareno said.

“This is more important than ever to ensure that proper protections are in place for our most vulnerable workers — especially as they get ready to begin the road to recovery. Worker rights need to be at the forefront of our plan to protect Chicago in our plan to reopen sooner, rather than later.”

Andy Fox, director of the city’s new Office of Labor Standards, said the city has received 32 complaints of retaliation against workers who stayed home during the pandemic.

The anti-retaliation ordinance would also apply to camp counselors and domestic workers. And employers would have 30-days to “cure” the violation before penalties are imposed.

Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) said he’s concerned documentation required to justify COVID-19-related absences may be “unachievable” for undocumented workers and those in low-wage jobs.

Fox assured the alderman the ordinance allows for “self-certification.”

“If the employee was able to produce a written note, a text — some communication that says, ‘I’m home. My doctor told me to be home. I’m quarantining’ — that would be enough for us to find this is a COVID-related instance. And if an employer took adverse action against them, we’d be able to investigate it and initiate an enforcement action,” Fox said.

“It is a slippery slope. We’d like something concrete to tie to it because it could be ripe for abuse if someone simply didn’t want to go to work. We want some communication with a medical provider.”",real

Last week (April, 2020), we published a report on the state of America’s hospital system in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak, and I wrote then:

The so-called Coronavirus pandemic “crisis” is very quickly taking a back seat to more serious crises in the U.S. right now, and perhaps none more critical than the closure of hospitals and emergency rooms, along with doctors and nurses being laid off, which is happening all across the country.

See:

The other crisis facing the U.S. right now that may soon dwarf the Coronavirus “crisis” is the nation’s looming meat shortage.

The nation now faces meat shortages, America’s primary source of protein, as processing plants across the country have shut down or reduced operations. 80% of the U.S. meat processing plants are owned by only 4 companies. Some grocery stores have already begun to limit meat purchases in advance of the expected shortages.

At recent White House Coronavirus Task Force Press briefings, the nation has heard President Trump boast about how he had brokered a trade deal with China back in January of 2020, that includes China buying $12.5 billion of American agricultural products. Trump has been highlighting this as a great deal for American farmers.

So which agricultural products did China choose to increase in purchase and export to China after Trump negotiated the trade deal between the two countries back in January?

Pork seems to be at the head of the list.

China has had major pork supply problems since last year (2019), due to an outbreak of “African swine fever.” Some estimates claim that about two-thirds of China’s swine herd has been lost to the disease. (Source.)

So being forced by President Trump into purchasing agricultural products as part of his trade deal, it is no surprise that pork is at the top of the list of exports China wanted.

U.S. livestock reports for last week (last week of April, 2020) show a five-week high in U.S. pork exports to China.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported export sales of U.S. pork in the week ended April 23 at 50,300 tonnes, a three-week high. China was the top buyer, booking 35,138 tonnes, while actual pork shipments to China totaled 20,683 tonnes, the most in five weeks. (Source.)

As U.S. pork sales soar due to the growing export market to China, U.S. customers are having an increasingly difficult time finding pork in their grocery stores, which may soon be bare of any pork products at all.

One has to wonder who got the better end of this trade deal with China?

The largest producer of pork in the world is Smithfield Foods, located in Smithfield, Virginia. According to their company website, some of the national brands they own include:

Smithfield®, Eckrich®, Nathan’s Famous®, Farmland®, Armour®, Farmer John®, Kretschmar®, John Morrell®, Cook’s®, Gwaltney®, Carando®, Margherita®, Curly’s®, Healthy Ones®, Morliny®, Krakus®, and Berlinki®. (Source.)

Smithfield Foods was bought by the Chinese company Shuanghui International Holdings Limited in 2013.

According to a recent report at CNBC, Trump is aware of this problem, but is hesitant to restrict exports to China right now.

President Donald Trump’s executive order this week requiring American meatpacking plants to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic is raising new questions about massive U.S. meat exports, particularly the export of pork to China. The order has highlighted a debate inside the White House over whether to limit exports of pork to China, and what the president decides could have major implications for other U.S. exports. On Wednesday, Trump held a private call with major meat industry CEOs, where he was asked about the prospect of export limits on meat, given that an imminent shortage for U.S. consumers was the justification for the executive order. The president responded that he is not interested in restricting exports at this time, according to current and former White House officials who requested anonymity to describe a private call. Still, there are some in the White House who are pushing for tighter export restrictions on meat, a former administration official told CNBC. (Source.)

The U.S. Agricultural Industry is not Sustainable or Secure – This is What Happens when a National Crisis Happens

The first 5 presidents of the United States were all farmers (the 6th president was the son of a farmer who was also the 2nd president) at a time when 90% of the population in the United States was involved in agriculture.

By the time Abraham Lincoln served as president of the United States in 1862, about 48 percent of the people living in the U.S. were farmers.

Today, that figure is less than 1%.

There has probably not been another period of history where so few people control a nation’s food supply as what we see today in the United States, where less than 1% are responsible for feeding over 325 million people in the United States, and millions around the world as well.

Who are these people that make up less than 1% of our population?

They are mostly people who run multi-national corporations. Oxfam America lists 10 main corporations that control most of the food in the U.S. and around the world as can be seen in this infographic:

I have been writing on the dangerous problems with America’s fragile food system for almost 20 years now, as have others.

In 2008, American filmmaker Robert Kenner produced a documentary on America’s food system called “Food, Inc.” It received great reviews, but really did not take off until 2010, when members of the film appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, where a discounted copy of the film was promoted and sold through Amazon.com.

One of the more revealing portions of the film was regarding commercial chicken production in the U.S. Contract farmers with the big poultry producers like Tyson and Purdue were too afraid to go on camera and expose what the industry was doing, by basically indenturing poultry farmers to a lifestyle said to be similar to slavery.

One poultry farmer who may have already been on her way out of the industry did appear on camera. Her testimony can be found on YouTube. She was the only one brave enough to become a whistleblower.

The US Poultry and Egg Association has produced a video of their own version of their industry, probably produced as a rebuttal to the bad press the industry has received over the years, particularly since Food, Inc. was produced. Here is their side:

With meat shortages in America potentially affecting millions of Americans for the first time in modern history, it might be time for the American consumer to learn a bit more about how the food they have been purchasing and eating these past years has arrived on their table.

Civil Eats published an Op-Ed last week titled:

Contract farmers don’t own the animals they’re raising, so they can’t sell them to another market. And the animals themselves haven’t been bred to stay alive.

By Tyler Whitley

Some excerpts:

For decades, farmers and their advocates have warned us of the inherent weaknesses in our food system. Now, in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, those weaknesses are laid bare: Big Ag has built a food system house of cards that is collapsing on the farmers who feed us.

Rather than acknowledge the need for reform, and in an effort to shift blame, Tyson Foods recently took out full-page ads in several major newspapers claiming that “the food supply chain is breaking” because of plant closures. But as the architects of this devastation, Tyson Foods has profited in the billions for the last three years in a row, while spending millions on federal lobbying to maintain the status quo of a fragile food system that values corporate profits over people, land, and animals.

In the last two weeks, slaughter and meat processing plants have been shuttered across the country as hundreds of workers have fallen ill. Thirteen plants employing tens of thousands of workers have now closed, creating a predictable bottleneck. Restaurants and institutional cafeterias have closed, leaving contracts hanging, and driving up demand for products in supermarkets instead. As the supply chain reels from this massive disruption, farmers who raise chickens, hogs, and cows are left facing a costly crisis that could mean bankruptcy for many: They have nowhere to send the animals they’ve raised for companies like Tyson.

Last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced plans to have its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) work with farmers to either find new markets, or euthanize and dispose of animals stranded in the supply chain. This plan offers too little, too late to farming families that depend on the companies to fill their barn. The USDA fails to address the fact that farmers under contract don’t own the animals they are raising, and therefore cannot simply find a new market for them. Having failed repeatedly for over a decade to establish basic protections for farmers in contracts with the big meat packers, the USDA is clearly sidestepping responsibility and avoiding the problem.

Depopulation of pigs, cows, and chickens could mean the death of millions of otherwise healthy animals. To date, nearly 2 million animals have been culled. One estimate out of Iowa warns that farmers may be asked to euthanize 700,000 pigs a week due to the processing plant bottleneck.

This is not an unpredictable consequence; the supply chain was designed this way. The advent of the Confined Animal Feeding Operation (or CAFO) in the 70s and 80s led to a technological revolution in agriculture. Taking animals off of pasture and keeping tens of thousands in dark, closed barns seems counter-intuitive because of the added costs of feed and increased health problems. But public policies were established to subsidize cheap grain for animal feed, enable the heavy use of antibiotics, and funnel taxpayer dollars in an attempt to clean up the mess.

This has allowed big meat companies to reap profits without paying the full cost of doing business. As a result, farms raising animals on pasture and operating more sustainably was only possible for those farmers who had access to higher-end (mostly urban and suburban) markets.

The CAFO boom directly contributed to exponential corporate concentration in the meat sector. For the last 40 years, a handful of very large companies including Tyson, Smithfield, and Perdue have built the system we have today, buying up smaller family businesses and destroyed regional food systems in their wake.

As their vertical supply chains grew, independent auctions and processors went out of business. Farmers raising chickens and pigs independently had fewer places to sell or process their animals. Soon, the only way for most farmers to stay viable raising poultry or livestock was to get a contract with a big company. Today, contract farming is the norm for meat production. Ninety percent of the 9 billion chickens raised each year in this country are grown under contract. Fifty-seven percent of hogs are owned and slaughtered by just four companies.

Big multinational companies dominate the market for almost all the meat we eat in the United States. Companies like Tyson own every step in the supply chain, from the hatchery to the feed mill to the processing plant. The only thing the big companies don’t own are the farms themselves.

Mr. Johnson appeared determined to stand by Mr. Cummings, an enigmatic figure who helped mastermind his election victory last year and the Brexit campaign that resulted in Britain’s departure from the European Union.

But the reports that Mr. Cummings had driven to his parents’ house in Durham in April when the government was urging people to stay home — particularly those with symptoms of the virus — set off a political tempest, with critics accusing him of flouting the rules that apply to everybody else.

“The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings,” said a spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, who added that he had “breached the lockdown rules.”

Leaders of two other opposition parties, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, demanded that he resign or be fired.

Confronted by reporters outside his home on Saturday, Mr. Cummings said, “I behaved reasonably and legally.” Asked whether his decision had been “a good look,” he replied: “Who cares about good looks? It’s a question of doing the right thing. It is not about what you guys think.”

The furious reactions to his trip attested to the polarizing role Mr. Cummings has played in British politics since before the 2016 Brexit referendum. He has accumulated a long list of enemies, including some in the Conservative Party, like Iain Duncan Smith, a former party leader, whom he has ridiculed or sidelined.

But it also showed Mr. Johnson’s deep reliance on Mr. Cummings. The prime minister dug in his heels on Saturday, releasing a statement, through a spokesman, that defended Mr. Cummings and his wife for making the 260-mile drive to Durham. t said, they had been trying to line up care for their young child after he contracted the virus and expected he would fall ill.

The adviser went to a house “near to but separate from his extended family,” the statement said, after his sister and nieces had offered to help.

“His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines,” the statement said.

If so, however, Mr. Cummings seemed eager not to disclose the trip. His wife, the journalist Mary Wakefield, wrote an account of her husband’s illness in The Spectator that made no mention of their drive and suggested he had been bedridden for 10 days at home with a “high fever and spasms that made the muscles lump and twitch in his legs.”

Mr. Cummings himself described being shut in with Ms. Wakefield, who also had symptoms, for more than two weeks, beginning at the end of March, when he contracted the virus soon after Mr. Johnson.

Violations of the lockdown by prominent figures have become a recurring theme in Britain, with the penalties falling harder on private citizens and scientific experts than on government officials.

Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist and adviser to the government, stepped down from a key scientific panel after acknowledging he had invited a woman with whom he was reported to be romantically involved into his apartment during the lockdown. Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, resigned in April after reports she had traveled twice to a vacation home.

But Robert Jenrick, the secretary for housing, communities and local government, held on to his job after admitting he had driven an hour outside London to visit his parents. And Stephen Kinnock, a prominent Labour member of Parliament, brushed aside criticism from the police after he visited his father, Neil Kinnock, for his birthday in March.

Though an adviser and not an elected politician, Mr. Cummings has twice been critical to Mr. Johnson’s political success. Not only is he an accomplished campaigner, the man behind the pro-Brexit slogan “take back control,” but he also inspired Mr. Johnson’s agenda to spread prosperity to neglected areas of the country, including the north.

His public profile rose when he was portrayed by the actor Benedict Cumberbatch in a drama about the Brexit campaign, as a sort of tortured genius determined to destroy the political elite. Since the election, he has reveled in his image as an eccentric, disheveled iconoclast, intent on reinventing government — Downing Street’s answer to Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former strategist.

Mr. Cummings put out a call for “weirdos and misfits” to join him in the government (one of those appointed later resigned). He mocked cabinet ministers, appearing to suggest that children’s cartoon characters might do a better job. And he clashed with grandees of the Conservative Party, once describing a former Brexit secretary, David Davis, as “thick as mince,” “lazy as a toad” and “vain as Narcissus.”

Cabinet ministers and other Conservative lawmakers showed support for Mr. Cummings on Saturday, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab; the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak; and the health secretary, Matt Hancock.

“I know how ill coronavirus makes you,” Mr. Hancock tweeted. “It was entirely right for Dom Cummings to find childcare for his toddler, when both he and his wife were getting ill.”

Others stayed silent, however, perhaps waiting to see whether Mr. Cummings could ride out the storm.

While the Labour Party demanded answers, it stopped short of demanding his resignation. That appeared to reflect a tactical judgment by the party leader, Keir Starmer, that the episode would do more damage to the government, which is already on the defensive for its handling of the virus, if it were dragged out over several days.

And criticism flowed not just from opposition politicians.

Julia Hartley-Brewer, a broadcaster and journalist who generally leans to the right politically, described how she had been separated from her 77-year-old mother, who lives on her own and suffered a heart attack in December.

“So excuse me if I am beyond bloody incandescent at what Dominic Cummings did,” she wrote in a tweet that used another expletive.

President Trump acknowledged Thursday that there could be a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic later this year, but flatly stated he wouldn’t let any further outbreaks shutter the economy again.

“People say that’s a very distinct possibility,” Trump said when asked a possible second wave while in Michigan. “It’s standard. And, we’re going put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country.”

Trump’s comments came as he was touring a Ford Motor Co. plant outside of Detroit that has converted its automobile manufacturing facility into one making ventilators. During a speech at the plant, the president praised Ford workers for their efforts to produce thousands of ventilators during the pandemic.

“The global pandemic proves once and for all that for America to be a strong nation, America needs to be a manufacturing nation,” Trump said. “I’m fighting to bring back our jobs from China and many other countries.”

Conservative radio host Buck Sexton said Trump had told this to him during a White House interview Wednesday, saying, “We will not do a lockdown for the second wave that is likely to come in the winter.”

During his speech, the president also lashed out at China for its role in the coronavirus pandemic.

“It came in from China and it should have been stopped in China,” he said.

The first reports of the contagion surfaced late last year in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province, and the disease quickly spread across the globe. As of Thursday, over 5 million people have been infected worldwide with over 329,000 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. – READ MORE",fake
553,1060,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pmis-inflammatory-syndrome-kawasaki-disease-children-coronavirus-link/,2020-05-15,"What parents should know about the mysterious illness appearing in kids, according to doctors","At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic it appeared that young people were largely spared from the virus. Now, doctors believe there's growing evidence that a rare, mysterious illness appearing in children may be linked to the virus.

It's been dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS or PIMS. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it Thursday afternoon, referring to the condition as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Symptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic-shock syndrome. PMIS, however, is being recognized as a ""new entity,"" according to Dr. Luiza Petre, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine in New York.

Kawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system's response to infection, but an official cause is unknown.

Children with Kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days, a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck; affected children can also develop redness in their eyes, lips, mouth, as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most children recover, but if left untreated, Kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life-threatening. Toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow, but is triggered by a bacterial infection.

Kawasaki disease mostly occurs in children under the age of 5, while a study of PMIS cases in Italy found an average age of 7½.

While an understanding of PMIS is still evolving, children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever, rashes, change in the color of their skin or their lips, swollen glands and red eyes. What differentiates PMIS from Kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chest pain.

""What we're seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,"" Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric oncologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, in New Orleans, who has treated several children for the illness, told CBS News. ""Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can have basically a heart attack.""

According to Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with PMIS, as compared to Kawasaki disease.

All together, the syndrome has shown to be more severe than Kawasaki. ""That's what's concerning,"" Petre told CBSN. ""And a lot of (PMIS) cases do require ICU, almost 80% of them.""

PMIS has been reported in over 100 children in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. CBS News has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries.

Doctors in Italy published a study Wednesday documenting numerous cases of PMIS linked to the coronavirus. Eight out of 10 children they studied with PMIS had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had been infected.

The fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation, O'Leary said. He cautioned, however, that it's still too early to say anything for certain: ""Some of the things I tell you will be true tomorrow, but some of them may not,"" he said.

CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula said, ""It's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.""

New clues in mysterious illness potentially linked to COVID-19 in children

A majority of the children with PMIS symptoms reported in New York have also tested positive for COVID-19, but others have not. ""That is something we doctors don't have an explanation for,"" Petre said.

""If we talk about the frequency of Kawasaki disease, even the specialists in this disease say they've never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital,"" she said. ""So that's something definitely suspicious about the timing between COVID and these cases.""

According to O'Leary, PMIS cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of COVID-19 cases in an area. If the syndrome is brought on by a COVID-19 infection, the lag time for PMIS symptoms is a curious feature, he said. ""It's almost more surprising that most of these kids are (COVID-19) positive.""

""That's the mystery, it's a lot like a delayed reaction,"" Petre said of the symptoms' onset.

If a child does present with PMIS symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor. According to Petre, if a child has a fever that doesn't go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day, a doctor should be contacted.

The American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms:

a fever that won't go away

abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting

rash or changes in skin color

trouble breathing

your child seems confused or overly sleepy

""In this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly, and they should seek medical attention immediately,"" Petre said.

According to Petre and O'Leary, if a child is admitted for PMIS, their primary treatment will be supportive care. Fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure, as well as anti-inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin (IVIG).

""If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed,"" said Kleinmahon. ""Fortunately children overall are very resilient. And almost all of the cases, if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.""",real

In our series, ""Profiles in Service,"" we meet a group of veterans answering the call and bringing their skills to a different kind of frontline — in a different kind of battle.

Colonel Melissa Givens spent two decades as an emergency room physician in the U.S. Army.

""I'm getting choked up thinking about this, but you served 20 years in the military, and now you're retired, but you're still serving your country,"" CBS News' Norah O'Donnell told Givens.

""There's nothing I would rather do and I'm with the people I would choose to do it with for the rest of my life,"" Givens replied.

For Givens, it's about a life of service. In record time, she helped New York-Presbyterian Hospital transform an indoor soccer stadium into a field hospital for COVID-19 patients.

""What led you to this new mission?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I really felt the call to serve,"" Givens said. ""I'm a physician. I had skills I could offer.""

There was a critical need — over 200 beds — but how would they find doctors and nurses? Colonel Givens posted on social media. In 36 hours, over 800 veterans answered the call to serve.

""I'm actually overwhelmed at the response of these veterans and their willingness to leave their homes and their families and put themselves at risk,"" said Givens. ""But on the other hand, I'm not surprised at all. This is what veterans do, they have a calling to serve.""

Veterans like former flight medic Ricky Ditzel Jr., who left the U.S. Army two weeks ago.

""Most people don't race to the epicenter of a pandemic, but you did. Why?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I saw the opportunity to continue to serve and I figured a pandemic environment was very similar to an environment overseas,"" Ditzel explained.

The field hospital is named after Navy SEAL Ryan Larkin, a medic and sniper who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""He was somebody who had a passion for serving and caring for patients, and we really wanted to honor his name,"" Givens said.

Colonel Givens now serves as the hospital's medical director. The head nurse and the hospital's chief operating officer are also women. ""It's felt good to have this — I would almost call it a sisterhood — as we try and solve hard problems,"" said Givens.

""What have you learned while you are there in New York at that field hospital?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I think it's just been reinforced in me just how good the human spirit is,"" Givens replied. ""If you put the call out, people will respond. They just need to know how to help and they're going to show up.""",real

“Non-interference in the affairs of other countries, maintenance of territorial integrity and showing respect for the national sovereignty of other countries are among clear and unchangeable principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Sunday.

“Therefore, while emphasizing the importance of respect for the principle of the ‘united China’, the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the People’s Republic of China and any harm to this country’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underlines the need for ... keeping order to ensure stability, welfare and security of the people of Hong Kong,” the Iranian spokesman said.

Hong Kong was witnessing a renewal of protests on Sunday over a newly-proposed security law as a lockdown imposed over the coronavirus outbreak gradually loosens.

The proposed law was recently submitted for deliberation to the National People’s Congress (NPC) and it aims to boost security measures and safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after violent protests rocked the region for months last year.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday that Hong Kong was an internal affair and no foreign interference would be allowed.

“Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US,” Wang said, adding, “This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies.”

Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien warned on Sunday that China's proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong could lead to US sanctions and threaten the city's status as a financial hub.

""It looks like, with this national security law, they're going to basically take over Hong Kong and if they do ... Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,"" O'Brien said on NBC's Meet the Press.

Tuesday also marked a record-high number of new cases — 4,014 — although Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office said that positive count came from 29,266 tests results. That’s the most the state has ever received back in a day. Pritzker said more than 20,000 were performed within 24 hours, marking a new record for the state in testing.

“There is a proportionality there, that as you test more, you’re going to get more positives from within those additional tests,” Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said.

The state has now seen 83,021 positive cases, as the virus remains in 98 of 102 counties. Illinois has received 471,691 total tests back since the pandemic began, health officials said.

Illinois’ positivity rate is 18% from May 2 to May 9. That metric is being looked at under a magnifying glass since Pritzker included it as one of several numbers needed under 20% in his regional reopening plan.

The total number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units was down by 33 from Sunday to Monday. During that same timeframe, there was no change in ventilator use, although the number of total COVID-19 patients entering hospitals went up by 307, the governor’s office said.

Tuesday’s fatality count is higher than the previous two days, when the state saw fewer than 100 deaths each day. The governor’s administration released new projections a day earlier from researchers that indicate the state will see a range of 50 to 150 deaths into June or July. Northwestern University, one of three universities involved in the state’s projections, has predicted a more dire range of 50 to 300 deaths.

But Pritzker signaled some optimism on Monday in revealing three of four regions in his reopening plan are “on pace” to potentially enter a new phase of reopening when his latest stay-at-home order expires on May 29.

The governor on Tuesday said he is speaking with the governors in nearby Midwestern states, some of whom are already reopening businesses.

“We are sharing ideas and making sure that we’re following best practices. It is different from one state to another. Indiana is a different state than Illinois. We have different concerns and Michigan’s different as well,” Pritzker said. “...Each of us have different timetables. It’s again based a lot on at least or Illinois and a lot of the other states, based on health care metrics.”

Pritzker, however, said he is concerned about Illinoisans traveling to neighboring states.

“I am concerned because I think that in many ways that opening too early or the potential spread of the virus in those states will affect our metrics in Illinois,” Pritzker said. “I understand that people may cross over the border, but I think they should take into account the danger, the potential anyway, of the spread of the virus and their ability to carry that virus back over the border when they come back.”

Facing some pushback against his order extension, Pritzker said he “would consider” withholding federal aid or taking other actions like revoking liquor licenses against local leaders and businesses who disobey the directive, as Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has threatened to do in that state.

“I would just suggest that there are a number of enforcement mechanisms that are available to us. And I don’t want to utilize those. I have asked people to do the right thing and I want to point out that the vast majority of people in Illinois have been doing the right thing and I’m so very proud of that,” Pritzker said, calling opponents of the stay-at-home order “outliers.”

“These people do not follow science or data. They’re just listening to partisan rhetoric perhaps and following their own instincts, but not science.”",real

Stories When living in a crisis is a job: lockdown survival tips from seasoned pros. Part 3: Polar Explorer

As the 'coronacrisis' poses one challenge after another, people are struggling to adapt to a new reality. RTD explores how people who endured hardship in their line of work handle isolation, uncertainty, and health risks – conditions many of us are experiencing during the coronavirus pandemic. In a series of short interviews, a cosmonaut, a submariner, and a polar explorer explain how to stay focused and even benefit from the current misfortunes.

The third hero is Viktor Boyarsky, an Honoured Polar Explorer of Russia, member of the Russian Geographical Society and the National Geographic Society of the United States, Chairman of the Polar Commission. He explains how a polar expedition can bring out the worst in people, what is the best way to fight loneliness, and what happens if you run out of food in the middle of an icy waste.

Polar explorers spend a lot of time away from their families. Today, a lot of people separated from their families by the lockdown, have to go through the same ordeal. From your experience, what is the best way to cope with this?

For a polar explorer, living away from your family for a year or more is one of the most challenging things. But then again, we know about this in advance, it doesn't take us by surprise. Do you remember the book, The Count of Monte Cristo? This man has just got married, and suddenly, he's thrown to jail for 18 years – that was so unexpected, so horrible, so hard to come to terms with. But with modern means of communication, even Antarctica has internet access, not to mention other ways to stay in touch.

How does it feel to be cut off from civilisation all the time? What is the most annoying or frustrating thing about it? How did you deal with this feeling?

Actually, everyone would like to find themselves away from the civilisation once. As the famous Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky put it, 'North is freedom, hope, land without borders.' You get out of the tent, you look around, and you see snow, purity, ice. You can just let everything go; there's nothing around you that might upset you. I've been married for 46 years, and a total of 16 years I spent away from my family.

Polar explorers have to stay in a confined space with colleagues for months on end. Under lockdown, many people are limited to their small apartments, with their families. How did you manage that?

Chronicles of the Double Pole Expedition, Arctic Ocean, 1995/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

Polar explorers have nothing to worry about; they're like pilots, cosmonauts, submariners, they all put themselves in the lockdown voluntarily. With professions like these, you just take it for granted. What matters is that you have a job that needs to be done.

I went on some extreme expeditions. Usually, polar explorers live at research stations. You can get some privacy there; spend some time on your own. And when you're on an expedition, you have to stay in a tent for a long time. But even then, here's what we did: there were six of us (two men per tent), and we switched every six weeks, so it didn't get too boring.

What things could lead to conflict? How did you resolve disputes?

It all depends on a person's life experience, to what extent they are ready to cooperate with others in an extraordinary situation, to avoid any escalation. Sometimes, you have to look for common ground, agreeing to things that you would deem unthinkable in any other situation. Being able to compromise under duress is a sign of strength, not weakness. When someone insists on doing things their way, it could result in a conflict. So, you should take one step back, give way, even if it's against your principles – in this situation, it'd be justified.

Did you pick people that you knew would be able to cooperate well?

International Trans-Greenland Expedition, 1988/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

You don't pick your team beforehand; it happens on its own. Usually, when the station is established, people are hired according to their professional skills. And then, during the winter camp, people gradually get used to each other. Later, it becomes apparent, who will work together next time, and who will never work with each other. A stationmaster writes character references, they determine the future of these people. Who's not recommended for working at the winter camp, who's too difficult, uncooperative or unsociable. That's how people are filtered out.

What is the absolute no-go when you're in a confined space with peers/relatives? Joking, gossiping?

It's not just about staying in a confined space; it's about being able to live with a small select group of people. That's when the true character is revealed, the traits that remained hidden before. In such situations, you should try to avoid hurting other people's feelings. You should put aside your ambitions for the time being, and observe everything that is going on around you carefully.

The loneliness. What would you recommend those people who spend the lockdown on their own? How can they avoid sinking into despair?

When you get the blues, you should try to look at the situation from 'it could've been worse' perspective. You should always compare what you could've had and what you've got – it helps to see things from a universal human standpoint. Then you'll stop worrying about 'oh, someone took my bowl or my glass,' such things start to seem a mere trifle, it's sobering.

The fear. People have a lot of worries too – to get sick, to leave their dependents to their own devices, the fear of the unknown. What fears did you face in expeditions, how did you overcome them? Can your methods help our readers?

Through the ice drifts and towards the North Pole, 2003/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

During our major expedition, when we walked to Antarctica, the prevailing fear was to contract some serious illness. In our situation, we couldn't expect help from anywhere. We would've just remained there. Despite this, there is no flu or colds in the Arctic and Antarctica; there are no viruses. All the infection is brought from the mainland when the teams are swapped. After that, the entire station comes down with something. But generally, all the polar explorers undergo medical examination before being dispatched to an expedition. Some severe conditions might show up there. The heart might fail, for example. We had such examples.

As for resources, in an expedition, they are calculated according to how much supplies one person needs per day. Sometimes, you run out of food. But today, you can always request help from the station. They either bring you supplies or take you from there.

If someone hurts himself, the rest share his work among them. But if a person feels really sick, you can call for a rescue plane. Later, when this person gets better, they make up for lost time – do a day's worth of work in half a day, and so on.",fake

My son defended his doctoral dissertation virtually this spring, from an apartment where he lives alone, 3,123 miles away from me. In normal times, one of his mentors would have brought a bottle of good champagne to toast the newly-minted Professor Clayton. In normal times, I’d have a ticket for a seat beside his 87-year-old grandfather on a six-hour flight to applaud the short moment of Chris walking across a stage in crimson silk gown and black-and-crimson hood, with the white crow's-feet emblem of an arts and sciences guy, an economist.

Instead, we’re looking for an alternative way to honor six years of incredibly hard work. I’m caught without the eggs and chocolate even to make his favorite flourless chocolate cake. I’m seeking advice by tweet about what that shop where he buys Thanksgiving pies might be, and whether they could deliver to his door in time for the box to be quarantined, or whether disinfecting it with bleach spray is good enough.

We've lost our traditions

Ceremony. Merriam Webster defines it as “a formal act or series of acts prescribed by ritual, protocol, or convention.” But what do you do when a pandemic makes ritual, protocol, and convention impossible? “Celebrate” is “to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with appropriate rites.” Publicly.

It feels indulgent, to grieve such a small loss. My family remains alive and uninfected. We are not saying that last goodbye by phone to a loved one dying in a hospital room without our hand to hold. We are not postponing that ultimate of ceremonies, the funeral. We are not having to bear that ultimate of griefs alone.

The loss of ceremony is not even the hardest thing my son has had to endure in his relatively short life. Not even close. And he starts his dream job at a university July 1. He won’t even suffer a health insurance gap.

And yet I cry in the shower, as do, I suppose, millions of us all over the world. We grieve the chance to celebrate those we love in what used to be the big moments in life, in the time before every moment of life itself seemed so very big. Moments that, all over the world, and for all of human history, have been marked by ceremony.

Pandemic life:We're slouching toward graduation at home with our college senior

No flipping of tassels or tossing of graduation caps this May and June. Not for college students or law students or Ph.D.s. Not for high schools. Not for middle schools or preschools. Not for medical students, many of whom are already out working in the fight to defeat this virus. Even the U.S. Naval Academy, where the hat-tossing tradition began in 1912, tossed theirs this year without the benefit of an audience to applaud.

No dancing at weddings or comic stuffing of cake bites into newlywed mouths. No babies crying over baptismal fonts. No awkward student welcomes and get-to-know-yous over the summer. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Publication parties. Film premieres. Retirements. Not even a Mother’s Day brunch for most of us.

Easter teleconference to meet a baby

This spring, there will be none of those moments we photograph and paste into scrap books, share with our virtual friends, and set out in frames for years to come.

So we adapt, of course. My niece introduces her new daughter into the family by Easter teleconference. My nephew considers delaying a fall wedding until we can all gather again. Zoom becomes a verb with a new meaning, and we have never been so grateful to be living in the time of video technology that was the stuff of television-show fiction when many of us were growing up.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

My son, like so many graduates this year, will attend a virtual commencement and a “special online event” for some smaller group of Ph.D. candidates or economists, the details of which are being worked out now.

He will also be feted in person “sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again,” his university president assures us. That celebration will come with “all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical” of their commencements, and “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.”

We need a Coronavirus Service Corps:It will help America and our vulnerable young people

We will be there whenever we can be, and we will applaud all the more enthusiastically for having endured this moment and come out on the other side. We hope we will, anyway. We are staying indoors, and living without eggs if they can’t be delivered to us, and recognizing the privilege we have to be able to stay inside, stay well, and endure only these small griefs.

And, yes, we cry in the shower. But we also appreciate these pivotal life moments even more somehow, for having to experience them virtually, or to look forward to the time when “celebrate” is once again a present-tense verb.

591,1805,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/22/nasa-spacex-home-launch-florida-spectators-coronavirus/111846786/,2020-05-22,Will virus keep Florida spectators from astronaut launch?,"Orlando, Fla. – In ordinary times, the beaches and roads along Florida’s Space Coast would be packed with hundreds of thousands of spectators, eager to witness the first astronaut launch from Florida in nine years.

In the age of coronavirus, local officials and NASA are split on whether that’s a good idea.

NASA and SpaceX are urging spectators to stay at home next Wednesday for safety reasons. Officials in Brevard County, home to the Kennedy Space Center, are rolling out the welcome mat in an effort to jump-start a tourism industry hit hard this spring by coronavirus-related lockdowns.

In this Friday, July 8, 2011 file photo, crowds gather in the surf and on the beach in Cocoa Beach, Fla., to watch the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis on STS-135. It was the final U.S. shuttle mission before the fleet was retired. (Photo: Dave Martin, AP)

If people are comfortable coming and watching the launch, “by all means, come. If they aren’t, I respect that too,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

“I’m not going to tell Americans they can’t watch a great piece of history. I’m just not going to do it,” he said.

The sheriff said he is asking visitors to practice social distancing as they watch the launch of astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a test flight of SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT.

Around 85 reserve deputies will be on hand to monitor crowds and ask people to comply with social distancing if they are in groups. A local chain of beach shops is distributing 20,000 masks to spectators in coordination with the sheriff’s office, Ivey said.

The sheriff, who grew up in Florida watching launches, wants a new generation to be able to experience the energy, excitement and feelings of patriotism that comes from watching a U.S. launch with astronauts.

“NASA is a true part of our history in Brevard County,” Ivey said.

Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine asked potential spectators to watch the launch online or on TV from home. The space agency is also offering a “virtual launch experience.”

NASA is doing its best to facilitate social distancing inside the Kennedy Space Center by limiting access, although it may be hosting two VIPS. Vice President Mike Pence says he plans to be there, and President Donald Trump said he’s thinking of attending.

The visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for viewing launches, is closed to the public.

NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. It will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit for the space agency.

“The challenge that we’re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,” Bridenstine said. “And so we’re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.”.

Although crowd sizes varied, a high-profile space shuttle launch could attract a half million visitors to the Space Coast. Local tourism officials think next week’s launch will bring in no more than 200,000 spectators.

With airline passenger traffic drastically down and nearby Orlando theme parks closed because of the pandemic, “we’re not going to be getting the out-of-state traffic we may have gotten during the shuttle era,” said Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.

“The environment is different with COVID and people now reemerging from stay-at-home orders,” Cranis said. “There are going to be a number of people who are hesitant.”

The Space Coast’s tourism business is down by about 40% for the year, and that could cost the area $1 billion, he said.

“A launch like this after a big long weekend could really give us a shot in the arm,” Cranis said.

Local hoteliers are looking forward to the influx of visitors after two bad months. Tom Williamson, who is general manager of two hotels on the Space Coast, each with 150 rooms or more, said one hotel was closed and the other only had 15% occupancy in April. He expects both hotels to be at or near capacity on the night of the launch.

“We’re glad to seem some signs of life,” Williamson said.

Steven Giraldo works as a technical consultant for a software company in St. Petersburg, Florida, but he has a side gig with some space-buff friends offering charter boat tours for watching launches. For next week’s SpaceX launch, he had booked around 150 people from as far away as Australia for $75 a head on a fleet of boats. He ended up scrapping those plans.

“It would take too much logistical effort to see if everyone is wearing a mask, making sure no one has a fever, and how to you social distance on a boat?” Giraldo said.

Instead, he plans to watch the launch with seven other friends, some from Arizona and Indiana, in a boat on the Banana River.

“This was going to be our biggest event. The historical significance of it created a lot of buzz,” Giraldo said. “But I just don’t know how we could have done it.”

601,2028,http://explorers.collective-evolution.com/part-of-the-problem-or-part-of-the-solution/,,,"In Brief The Facts: Major events have a lasting impact on human consciousness, and help people see what they once never saw before. This appears to be happening with the new coronavirus.

Reflect On: How do events like 9/11, and the new coronavirus impact human consciousness?

It’s truly an exciting time to be alive, and that’s because more and more people are “waking up” to concepts about our reality and the overall human experience that they were once previously unaware of. This has been happening for decades, but every single year it seems to amplify, and the process of our ‘awakening’ seems to accelerate rapidly.

This type of ‘awakening’ happens in all areas that surround human life. People learn deep truths about health and medicine, education, geopolitics, consciousness, extraterrestrials and much more. The idea that a small group of corporations and the people that run them have a strong hold on our perception, thoughts, emotions, and reactions regarding information and major world events is now far from a mere “conspiracy theory” in the eyes of many. It can be seen quite clearly, and mainstream media has been exposed as the true bearer of “fake news” by many people.

Events like the coronavirus simply accelerate the process of awakening, and expose mainstream media outlets for what they truly are in this moment. There’s a reason why mainstream media has such strong connections to intelligence agencies and have their roots in psychological warfare. You can find documentation and examples of that in an article I published a while ago here.

A quote from Edward Bernays, known as the father of public relations, is powerful because it sums up these thoughts quite well:

The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of.

Current Events & Collective Consciousness

When 9/11 happened, we were told that terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre. As the months and years went on, more and more people grew suspicious of their government’s explanation of what happened that day, this included many politicians and academics as well, further adding fuel to the fire. Evidence came forward, science was done and whistleblowers spoke out, giving us a very clear idea that what we were told happened that day, most certainly did not. Today, many polls show that more than half of the American people alone don’t believe the official explanation of what really happened that day. Since 9/11, hundreds of millions of people have become aware of “false flag” terrorism, which is the idea that the ‘powers that be’ created these events, fund terrorism, stage them, and then use these events to justify the infiltration of another country for ulterior motives. They basically create the problem, in several different ways, and then propose the solution.

Organizations like Wikileaks and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden have proved, as well as explained, how events like these are used to justify a heightening national security state, one where more and more of our basic rights and freedoms are stripped from us under the guise of ‘goodwill.’

But these events have shifted human consciousness. People become aware of how our world truly works and functions, a process we call ‘Breaking The Illusion‘ here at CE. People begin to see that the world they think is real is actually not, and that things like corruption exist within the geopolitical realm, an important realization if you wish to reflect on whether our political process truly serves us or not. This then changes the perception of people around the world, causing us to choose new paths and actions as to how to live our lives in society. Paths that would not change if we never ‘broke the illusion.’

Another major event is happening right now, the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to COVID-19, what has many people asking questions is the ban and censorship of information. For example, YouTube is now actively banning any content that contradicts anything that the World Health Organization (WHO) states with regards to the new coronavirus. Vimeo recently banned a documentary exposing “Big Pharma’s” influence within the WHO. These blatant forms of censorship have some upset, but many others see it as an eyebrow-raising moment, showing quite clearly the corruption that exists in our world and the efforts that are put forth to control the perception of the masses. We then begin to ask why?

Controlling information and what people think is important if you wish to control their lives. This is why ‘Breaking The Illusion’ is one of the first steps in the CE formula to shift consciousness. After all, why do you think people like Julian Assange are in jail, and people like Edward Snowden are living in exile?

How far have we sunk if telling the truth becomes a crime? How far have we sunk if we prosecute people that expose war crimes for exposing war crimes? How far have we sunk when we no longer prosecute our own war criminals? Because we identify more with them, than we identify with their people that actually expose these crimes. What does that tell about us and about our governments? In a democracy, the power does not belong to the government, but to the people. But the people have to claim it. Secrecy disempowers the people because it prevents them from exercising democratic control, which is precisely why governments want secrecy. Nils Melzer (source)

With COVID-19, we are also seeing a large number of people questioning the measures that multiple governments have taken to lockdown countries. We are seeing people question the information that’s being put out by our federal health agencies, including the World Health Organization. We have seen a number of scientists in the field, as well as doctors, also question the official narratives, and we have seen people like Edward Snowden, and many more, explain how this ‘pandemic’ is being used for ulterior motives. You can access those articles at the end of this article if you’re interested.

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, we are now living in a time where a digital authoritarian ‘fact checker’ is patrolling the internet and censoring content it deems as ‘false.’ It does not matter if the information is true or false, backed by science or not, or whether it’s simply an opinion, if it doesn’t align with the mainstream narrative, you are not meant to see it or trust it. Should people not have the right to examine information, check sources, decide for themselves what is real and what is fake?

The Takeaway

COVID-19 has simply accelerated the process of awakening, and it’s also made even more people aware of the censorship of information that’s taking place. Along with the censorship of information, comes ridicule, and bashing by mainstream media in order to oppose and instantaneously shut down any opposite narrative.

Narratives that go against mainstream media narratives are not acknowledged or countered, they are simply ridiculed and deemed a “conspiracy theory.”

The point is, events like this serve the collective. They wake us up, they help us see, they help shift the perceptions about our world and our world ‘leaders’ and serve as a catalyst for more people to start asking questions, and to see that what we are told is not always what is. This is why events as such, although hard in many senses, and real in many ways, do indeed move humanity forward in a ‘positive’ direction. What’s happening now is not a tragedy, it’s exciting, and it’s not as bad as they’ve made it out to be. But again, you can go into that type of discussion and many more, in the articles below.

630,342,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21221958/coronavirus-treatment-data-hydroxychloroquine-trump-remdesivir,2020-04-16,The search for COVID-19 treatments shows how messy science can be,"There’s yet another new study out this week on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug championed by President Trump (without evidence) as a cure for COVID-19. Bottom line: the hospitalized patients who took it didn’t seem to be any better off than patients who didn’t take the drug. Some patients had to stop taking the drug because of cardiac side effects.

The report isn’t published yet, and hasn’t gone through the standard review process, but doctors are starting to sort through its findings. It’s not a good sign for the drug. But this single study is not a killer blow, either.

That’s because a lone study or single clinical trial rarely offers incontrovertible evidence to disprove or bolster a claim — especially if, like this one, the study is small. Instead, it takes the buildup of data from multiple large trials and studies to guide medical decision-making. Everyone is desperate for answers around COVID-19, so there are more eyes on each new data point added to the pile. Watching that process in real time shows how messy science can be.

Therefore, HCQ does not seem useful in advanced states of #COVID19 disease. We will have to wait for the results of studies in patients with mild symptoms to understand if HCQ is able to counteract the progression of the disease.https://t.co/0PvNzCP8L7

2/2 — Cristina Dragani (@CristinaDragani) April 14, 2020

This particular hydroxychloroquine study included 181 people, which is small enough that scientists would hesitate to draw large conclusions from its results. It was also conducted with people who were already sick enough to be hospitalized. Other studies of the drug, which reached similarly dismal conclusions about how well it worked, were also done in hospitalized patients. But still other ongoing studies are testing how well it works in people who aren’t as sick, and whether it may prevent people who haven’t caught the virus yet from developing the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19. With viral infections, earlier treatment tends to be better — that’s why people have to take Tamiflu right when they start feeling sick in order for it to work to treat the flu, for example.

Scientific research doesn’t usually provide yes-or-no answers. Instead, each new bit of evidence tilts the balance in one direction or another. While that’s happening, doctors make preliminary choices based on where they see that balance moving — as new data continues to be reported on hydroxychloroquine, some are deciding not to use it, while others may keep trying. They won’t be able to reasonably say they know for sure that it will or won’t work. It’s still a mostly open question, and decisions on care will still be made patient by patient for now.

Eventually, the balance of evidence will settle into a conclusion that experts have more confidence in. That might happen after researchers compile all the data from multiple small studies and analyze it as a group in a meta-analysis — that’s what might happen with the handful of small hydroxychloroquine studies that have been published already.

Even better, we might get more decisive data from larger studies. The World Health Organization’s Solidarity trial, for example, is testing multiple drugs (including hydroxychloroquine) in dozens of countries. Another study on the anti-viral remdesivir, which aims to include hundreds of patients, could also provide a clearer signal. Those types of studies take more time and resources, but they produce more conclusive results.

Patients are sick and dying from COVID-19 now, and there’s tremendous pressure to test drugs that might help them. In the United States, though, there has been limited coordination between groups running trials. It’s harder to understand where the balance of evidence lies when the research done is fragmented and disconnected, and when every researcher is asking a slightly different question.

“It’s a cacophony; it’s not an orchestra. There’s no conductor,” Derek Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told The Washington Post. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said that a coordination plan was in the works.

Scientific research is hard under the best of circumstances. Finding answers that doctors and scientists trust is a long and frustrating process. It’s many times harder during an active public health emergency, when treating patients is a priority. The constant release of new information can feel like whiplash, as something that seemed like a solution one week turns out to be less useful the next.

That same day, in McAllen, Texas, a teenage girl from Guatemala completed a sworn asylum declaration, claiming she would be persecuted because of her race, indigenous identity and refusal to join a gang if returned to her home country. Hours later, ICE picked her up.

The sisters and the teenage girl have three things in common. They all previously sought asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border alongside parents. They were sent to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, program. And they reentered the U.S. a second time — without their parents.

Minors are not supposed to be returned to Mexico under MPP if unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians, so some families have allowed their children to seek asylum in the U.S. alone. Between October 2019 and this month, at least 577 unaccompanied migrant children in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, have reported having their parents in Mexico, according to the agency.

Under a landmark court settlement, the U.S. government is obligated to make ""prompt and continuous efforts"" to unite unaccompanied migrant children with relatives or other sponsors in the U.S. while their immigration cases proceed.

But the government argues that children who have already been ordered removed with their families under the Remain in Mexico policy should be deported — even if they last entered the U.S. unaccompanied. Attorneys for the minors, however, say they should be treated like other unaccompanied migrant children.

Both the sisters and the teen girl have been fighting their case in court. A federal judge barred the government from immediately deporting the Salvadoran sisters, and they were released to their mother in Houston, according to attorneys. Their deportation proceedings are ongoing. Their father, with whom they were originally sent to Mexico, remains in Matamoros, Mexico.

The Guatemalan teen was transported by the government first to a motel in McAllen, then moved to another one in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to her attorneys. ICE was prepared to deport her on a flight Friday afternoon, according to Neha Desai, a lawyer who is part of the team representing all children in U.S. immigration custody. But her flight was postponed to Monday after the Guatemalan government said it would not receive the plane because of coronavirus cases among migrants recently deported by the U.S.

Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ruled on April 24 that deportation orders under the Remain in Mexico program do not change the government's obligation to seek the prompt release of migrant children to relatives and other sponsors in the U.S. under the landmark 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement.

""That policy just like any other pending proceedings or participation in class action proceedings or anything like that, if it results in a prolonged detention where deportation is not imminent, then it is causing unnecessary delay,"" Gee said during a hearing before issuing her order, which said the administration's ""opaque policies"" surrounding children with pending MPP cases violate the Flores settlement.

Advocates say ICE has seized on Gee's use of the word ""imminent"" to move to deport children in ORR care who have pending removal orders under the Remain in Mexico policy.

ICE said migrant children are only deported when ""their immigration case is complete and there are no legal impediments to removal.""

""If a minor received a final order of removal from an immigration judge as part of a family unit enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) — prior to entering the U.S. as (an unaccompanied migrant child) — then they are subject to the final order of removal,"" an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement Friday.

The agency did not comment on specific cases or say how deporting migrant children from shelters overseen by the U.S. government conforms with the adjusted ""enforcement posture"" it announced in March as a result of the pandemic. In its announcement, ICE said its agents would only focus on detaining ""public safety risks,"" as well as immigrants whose criminal records require the agency to apprehend them. For everyone else, the agency said it would ""delay enforcement actions"" until the crisis abated.

Mark Weber, a spokesman for ORR, said his office does not determine which children in its custody are deported, calling it a child welfare agency.

Desai said she is concerned that the government's actions are related to Gee's decision that children who were previously returned to Mexico and came back unaccompanied should be released to sponsors.

""We can't concretely say it's retaliation, but it sure feels like it,"" Desai said, adding that she believed the government had intensified attempts to deport these children after Gee's ruling was made.

Asra Syed, who represents the sisters in Houston, said that in addition to being so near to their mother, there were no relatives in El Salvador who the children could be safely returned to. A redacted filing reviewed by CBS News included descriptions of abuse and gang threats during the girls' youth.

""Our clients are the only detained children we know of who ICE is insisting on deporting even though: 1) they have a parent in the U.S. who ORR recommends they be reunified with, 2) they have no parent or other relative in their home country who can take care of them, and 3) they are really, really young — only 8 and 11,"" Syed said.

ORR currently has roughly 1,600 migrant children in its custody, a low population level not seen since 2011. The agency has been receiving few minors since late March from border officials, who are expelling most unauthorized migrants, including unaccompanied children, under an emergency public health order.",real

FILE PHOTO: Flight attendants talk in a nearly empty cabin on a Delta Airlines flight operated by SkyWest Airlines as travel has cutback, amid concerns of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), during a flight departing from Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S. April 11, 2020. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart/File Photo

Boeing has appointed former engineering and development chief Mike Delaney to head wider efforts to build confidence, and Airbus leaders say the industry is moving from an initial crisis phase to securing public trust.

That has triggered, among other things, a concerted effort to explain how cabin air filtration works in a bid to scotch the myth that the pressurised fuselage contains only static or recycled air.

Health officials are still quantifying various sources of transmission for COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, but attention focuses on the risk of catching it from airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing passengers as well as from touching infected surfaces.

The air-travel industry historically talks more about seat pitch than air quality. That’s had to change as a result of the pandemic.

“It’s about explaining what we do for the safety of passengers in the large sense: aircraft safety but also sanitary safety,” Airbus engineering head Jean-Brice Dumont said.

In an office building, air is exchanged about four times every hour. On a modern jet aircraft, that rises to 20 to 30 times.

“The air system on an airplane is as good as anything you will be exposed to,” Delaney said. Air circulation is only one of several techniques for reducing potential for the virus to spread on board including rigorous cleaning of the plane and screening passengers for signs of illness, he added.

In most cases compressed air is fed from the clean part of an engine - untainted by fuel which is added later - to air conditioning packs and from there to fans in the cabin ceiling.

Both planemakers say cabin air pours downwards not lengthways through the fuselage, reducing risks of infection.

Half that air is then recycled through hospital-grade HEPA filters designed to remove some 99.97% of contaminants including viruses. The other half is flushed outside through valves.

Planemakers say cabin air is renewed every two to three minutes, though scientists caution that in reality, air is always a blend. But the quicker the rate, the faster old air is diluted.

“The air turns over very, very quickly in the aircraft in terms of air-exchange rate. From that point of view the aircraft systems are very good,” said Professor Byron Jones of Kansas State University, who has helped recommend air standards.

HIGH OCCUPANCY

But air flow isn’t the only part of a complex equation.

“The biggest challenge you have on an aircraft is the extremely high occupant density. You have got a lot of people crammed into a small space, and you have to get a lot of air in there to ventilate that space to maintain the air quality,” Jones said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is thought to spread between people in close contact or less than 6 feet apart, around half the width of many cabins.

Air currents over such short distances are said to be hardest to predict. Passengers have some control through the individual air outlets nicknamed “gaspers” above each seat.

On average, twisting them on makes things “a little bit better, but there is no guarantee,” Jones said.

Although filtered, the pinpoint blasts of air could in a worst case push nearby virus particles across a passenger’s face. On the other hand, the air shower could have the positive effect of limiting sideways movements of air.

Faced with such questions, Boeing and Airbus have deployed engineers to examine seat-to-seat air flows - using the same advanced physics at play in wind-tunnel testing of a wing.

“We are actively running simulations to see whether we could recommend something for the individual air jets, “ Dumont said.

The spectre of in-flight contamination dates back at least to the SARS epidemic in 2003, though no link has been proved.

In March that year, a 72-year-old man infected with SARS, which is also a coronavirus, took a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. At least 22 of the 119 passengers and two crew later developed the illness.

It was the only significant case of in-flight transmission but prompted measures to prevent ill passengers boarding planes.

Such “kerb-to-kerb” measures must again be part of the strategy to keep the new virus off planes, Delaney said. Research on technology like ultraviolet-cleaning systems and anti-microbial materials may join the fight in the future.",real

Patients and health care workers are quickly going through medical supplies and disposable personal protective equipment, like masks. Eventually all that used gear piles up as medical waste that needs to be safely discarded.

In Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus first emerged, officials didn’t just need to build new hospitals for the influx of patients; they had to construct a new medical waste plant and deploy 46 mobile waste treatment facilities too. Hospitals there generated six times as much medical waste at the peak of the outbreak as they did before the crisis began. The daily output of medical waste reached 240 metric tons, about the weight of an adult blue whale.

Hospitals generated 6 times as much medical waste

There’s already been an uptick of garbage from personal protective equipment in the US, according to medical waste company Stericycle, which handled 1.8 billion pounds of medical waste globally in 2018. And some things that aren’t usually considered medical waste, like food, now need to be handled more carefully after coming in contact with a COVID-19 patient. Stericycle didn’t provide numbers for how much of an increase it’s seeing so far, adding that it believes it has the capacity to handle the swell and may add shifts to the company’s 50 treatment centers in the US if necessary. Additionally, the drop in elective surgeries might offset some of the rise in waste we’re seeing from the pandemic, a spokesperson for Stericycle tells The Verge.

“It’s a rapidly changing environment right now and forecasting volumes is challenging,” Stericycle Vice President of Corporate Communications Jennifer Koenig wrote in an email to The Verge. “We are closely monitoring the situation with all relevant agencies to determine next steps.”

“It’s a rapidly changing environment”

The CDC says that medical waste from COVID-19 can be treated the same way as regular medical waste. Regulations on how to treat that waste vary by location and can be governed by state health and environmental departments, as well as by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Department of Transportation. Generally, to make sure contaminated trash from health care facilities doesn’t pose any harm to the public before going to a landfill, it’s typically burned, sterilized with steam, or chemically disinfected.

There’s more to worry about than waste from medical centers. The disease is spread out beyond hospitals. Some people who have minor symptoms are recovering at home. Others who are asymptomatic might not know that the trash they’re throwing out could be contaminated. That means people may be generating plenty of virus-laden trash. That’s worrying for sanitation workers, as the virus can persist for up to a day on cardboard and for longer on metal and plastic, according to one study of the virus in lab conditions.

But if garbage is properly bagged instead of kept loose and workers are wearing personal protective equipment, especially gloves, then there shouldn’t be a risk of catching the virus, David Biderman, CEO of the Solid Waste Association of North America, tells The Verge. Practicing social distancing while on the job, including maintaining appropriate distances from people, may also help reduce sanitation workers’ risks, says Elise Paeffgen, a partner with the firm Alston & Bird who works on medical waste issues.

People handling health care waste should wear appropriate gear

People handling health care waste in particular should wear appropriate gear, including boots, aprons, long-sleeved gowns, thick gloves, masks, and goggles or face shields, according to recommendations from the World Health Organization. Luckily, protective efforts so far seem to have paid off. “There is no evidence that direct, unprotected human contact during the handling of health care waste has resulted in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus,” according to a March 19th technical brief from the WHO. As the pandemic grows, so will the waste, and keeping that garbage safe and contained will continue to be a challenge for communities until the crisis is over.",real
639,1636,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/bill-gates-backed-coronavirus-testing-program-shut-down-by-the-fda/,2020-05-21,BILL GATES-BACKED CORONAVIRUS TESTING PROGRAM SHUT DOWN BY THE FDA,"The Bill Gates-backed at-home coronavirus testing program has been halted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because it began operation without getting proper authorization, according to the New York Times. The agency noted that they do not have any specific safety concerns about the product, but said that they still needed to do some research to ensure that the tests were safe.

The program in question is known as the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and they are now being asked to put their operation on hold until proper authorization is obtained. This also means that patients who have already sent in their tests will not be able to receive their results until the authorization has been given. SCAN is promising that this shut down is only temporary.

SCAN’s website stated that, “The FDA has not raised any concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of SCAN’s test, but we have been asked to pause testing until we receive that additional authorization.”

SCAN was sending out free test kits to potential patients, including people who were asymptomatic, hoping to obtain some data on how the coronavirus spreads through people who don’t show symptoms.

In a statement announcing the finer details of the program last week, Gates said that, “As SCAN gathers more test results in the weeks ahead, researchers expect the new data to provide a better sense of the number of infections and serve as one source to help answer other questions, like when physical distancing measures can be relaxed.”

However, an FDA shut down order came within days of the announcement, and the details behind the order are still unclear. The United States has been slow to get started with mass testing, especially of asymptomatic individuals, and the tests are mostly controlled by government agencies like the CDC. The tests currently available have also been criticized for being inaccurate. Just last week, the FDA issued a warning about tests made by Abbott Laboratories, saying that they often gave falsely negative results.

640,1366,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/18/us-should-pay-people-get-tested-covid-19/,2020-05-18,The U.S. should pay people to get tested for covid-19,"An alternative is to learn about covid-19’s prevalence among all Americans. It’s unclear what share of the population is currently infected. Nor do we know how many have been exposed and developed antibodies, which would indicate how far we are from the approximately 70 percent necessary to attain herd immunity. This basic question has enormous influence on the pace at which society can confidently reopen — yet we are not even on a path to answers.





In at least a dozen states, testing capacity outstrips the supply of patients. Another approach is urgently needed.

No existing or planned covid-19 surveys meet the two fundamental conditions for testing results to reveal the true rate of spread.

First, the people invited to be tested must be representative of the general population. They should be drawn randomly. So far, much of what is known about U.S. cases comes from specialized populations: the sick and symptomatic, and essential workers. In Taiwan, 158 tests have been conducted for every confirmed case. In the United States, the rate is just eight and drawn largely from the groups mentioned above



Second, among those invited to be tested, those who show up must also be representative of the general population. Current approaches fall apart here because only a fraction of those able or invited to be tested follow through. The major covid-19 prevalence studies to date — Santa Clara, Iceland and even ongoing National Institutes of Health testing— have relied on the self-motivated or volunteers.



The problem is that volunteers differ from people who choose not to volunteer in ways that cannot be readily observed. This is why reliable polling is not based on specialized populations, such as people who have a particular interest in a topic, but on random sampling from the general population. In terms of the pandemic, people who are sick or suspect that they have been exposed might be more likely to seek testing, such that volunteers’ rate of infection could exceed that of the general population. In the other direction, the very health-conscious might jump at the opportunity to be tested, and their rate of infection might be below average.

Unrepresentative testing cannot produce a reliable compass to guide policy. If testing is not mandatory, individuals decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs: if the information and contribution to the public good are worth physical discomfort, general hassle and the invasiveness of sharing health information. These are not small problems. In Iceland, only 33 percent of those invited to be tested for covid-19 took up the offer; two-thirds of those invited decided the costs outweighed the benefits and went untested.



There is, however, another option. If economics has taught us anything, it is that financial incentives can change behavior. Offering payments for completed tests could change the calculus of those invited to be tested.



Some people might agree for $25. Some might follow through at $50 or $100. With each higher incentive, more people are likely to conclude that testing is worthwhile.

Absent the reliability of everyone being tested, plausible assumptions suggest it is possible to learn the infection rate in the general population by comparing how people’s infection rates vary with their willingness to be tested.

Governments could implement this approach inexpensively to learn about covid-19’s prevalence in their jurisdictions. Some colleagues and I are working to launch a program in Chicago, where we expect to determine a reliable measure of citywide prevalence with only 2,000 tests. We plan to draw a random sample of the population, invite the full sample to be tested and randomly offer incentives for completed tests.





This approach doesn’t require millions of tests or several hundred thousand contact tracers, averting privacy concerns. It is unhindered by shortages in testing supplies and protective equipment for those administering the tests.

Once launched, the tests could be repeated regularly to track how the disease evolves and even the protection offered by developing antibodies. The results could reliably be a guide to safely unlocking our economy. At lower rates of spread, partial reopenings could be based on data, not hope. And if we reach herd immunity, decision-making becomes easier.

Until we implement covid-19 testing that produces representative results, it is impossible to know the current prevalence of the disease or of past infection in the population. Policymakers need this information to navigate between the goals of protecting health and reopening the economy; without it, we all pay the cost in lives and livelihoods.





Better to pay smaller amounts, upfront, to encourage people to get tested.

“Honey” — the woman could hear fear tightening her husband’s voice as he called out to her — “I think your mother just died.” She ran into the living room. Her 78-year-old mother sat rigid in a chair, her skin gray and lifeless. Her eyes were open but all white, as if she were trying to see the back of her own skull. Then her arms started to make little jerking movements; her lips parted as saliva seeped out the corner of her mouth onto her chin. Then her body slumped. She seemed awake but confused after this seizure-like episode.
Should I call an ambulance? the husband asked. No, his wife responded. Her mother had a complicated medical history, including a kidney transplant 12 years before and an autoimmune disease. An ambulance would want to take her to the nearby Hartford Hospital. But her doctors were at Yale New Haven Hospital — some 30 miles from their home in Cromwell, Conn. They helped the woman into the car. It was only a half-hour drive to the hospital that March 10 evening, but it seemed to last forever. Would her mother make it? Her eyes were closed, and she looked very pale.
Her other daughter worked at the hospital and was waiting with a wheelchair when they arrived. The daughters made sure that the doctors and nurses knew that their mother took two medications to keep her immune system from killing her transplanted kidney. Because of those immune-suppressing drugs, she’d had many infections over the years. Six months earlier, she nearly lost her kidney to a particularly aggressive bacterium. She’d been well since then, until a few days earlier when she came down with a cold. It was just a sore throat and a runny nose, but the couple were worried enough to move her into their home to keep an eye on her. She didn’t want to eat because of the pain in her throat, but otherwise she seemed to be doing well.
A Possible Urinary-Tract InfectionThe exam in the emergency room was mostly unremarkable, though she was a little confused at times. Her kidneys were no worse than usual. Her chest X-ray was fine; there was no sign of pneumonia. The CT scan of her head was normal and provided no explanation for her seizure. Studies of her urine showed what might be an infection. And the woman’s white-blood-cell count, which would usually be sky-high if she had an infection, was instead dangerously low. There was no obvious cause of the low white-blood-cell count or the earlier seizure and current confusion. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics for a presumed urinary-tract infection.
The admitting team searched for the cause of the seizure. An M.R.I. of the brain showed nothing beyond normal age-related changes. A spinal tap showed no evidence of either a viral or a bacterial invader. After two days, the patient spiked a fever despite the antibiotics, and the team reached out to the infectious-disease doctors.
A Cough SurfacesIt was early afternoon by the time Dr. Thomas Holowka, a resident in his second year of training, went to see the patient. The woman’s answers were slow and uncertain. Did she have any pain when she urinated? Was she going more often than usual? For patients with bacteria in their urine, these are standard questions to determine whether those bacteria indicate a harmful infection or are peaceful residents of the microbiome. She had no pain, she told the young doctor, but she was peeing every time she coughed. And she was coughing a lot.
How long has that been going on? the resident asked. A while, the patient answered vaguely. When he examined her, the doctor noticed that she was tender over her right flank — the site of her transplant years before. The tenderness suggested an infection in that kidney. If so, she was on the right antibiotics. But that infection didn’t explain the seizure — or the cough.
Because she was immune-compromised, the resident was worried that the patient could have an infection in her respiratory tract as well. He recommended that the team get a CT scan of her lungs and blood tests to look for infections that are more commonly seen in patients who are immune-compromised. She’d been tested for the usual respiratory viruses. Should she be tested for the new coronavirus? At that time, March 13, there had been no cases of SARS-CoV-2 at Yale New Haven Hospital. There had been a couple of dozen cases of Covid-19 in Connecticut, but all of them were linked to a dinner party held in Westport, halfway across the state. It seemed unlikely, but Holowka decided to order it. And so that afternoon the patient was transferred to the floor set aside for hospitalized patients being tested for Covid-19.
Probably Not, But MaybeDr. Lydia Barakat, the infectious-disease specialist taking care of the patients on the Covid floor, thought the test might be overkill. The patient had the mildest cough and had experienced only a single fever spike since the antibiotics were started. She thought it very unlikely that the patient would test positive. But the family was worried, and Barakat understood why. This older woman was the kind of patient who would be particularly vulnerable if she got the virus.
The patient recalls clearly how unpleasant the test for the respiratory virus was. “I didn’t expect someone to go up my nose like that,” she told me. “I mean, wow!” The result came back just a few hours later. She was positive for Covid-19 — the second case, it would turn out, to be diagnosed that night in the hospital.
Her course was complicated. She got very sick. She stayed in the hospital a full month. She was given antimalarials, antibiotics and finally an anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressing medication. Slowly she recovered, and finally she went home.
What We Know NowThis patient came to the hospital early in our understanding of Covid-19. Now we know that this virus, like many viruses, causes the number of disease-fighting white blood cells to drop; it’s still not clear why. We also know that neurological symptoms, like headaches or the loss of sense of taste or smell, are common in Covid-19. And that seizures and confusion, while rarer, have been reported — in Wuhan and in Europe. Indeed, Barakat tells me that she and her colleagues have noticed that in older patients, neurological problems including confusion, falls and weakness may be some of the most frequent early symptoms of Covid-19.
Our knowledge of this illness — or any illness — is shaped by what we learn from patients who have the disease. With Covid-19, our inadequate supply of tests means that we’ve limited our use of them to patients who have what we already expect to see. This woman was tested only when she developed a classic sign of the infection. Yet her positive test taught her doctors something new about this disease — that it could cause seizures and confusion.
Should we test everyone who comes into the hospital? Perhaps we would learn more quickly about the symptoms of this illness. Moreover, because this patient was in the hospital for three days before being tested, dozens of health care workers and other front-line personnel were exposed.
No medical center is testing everyone right now. In New York City, all pregnant women who come into the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital system to give birth are automatically checked for Covid. Of 210 asymptomatic women tested on admission to labor and delivery in the first two weeks of the program, 29, or nearly 14 percent, were found to have Covid-19. Early identification of these cases allowed the hospital to use their precious personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) where it was most needed. Of course, no test is 100 percent accurate, and these particular tests, experts estimate, have a false negative rate as high as 30 percent. Trusting our gut, however, or what we think we know about this new disease, has already shown us how wrong we can be.

Texas succeeded in banning procedures for a month, forcing women to travel hundreds of miles for care in other states. Arkansas now requires women to obtain a negative COVID-19 test to get a surgical abortion.

Even though most restrictions have been lifted, women, abortion providers, and advocates remain on the defensive and fear that care could again be restricted during the pandemic.

The National Abortion Federation's Katherine Ragsdale told Insider she saw ""a danger of ending up in sort of a pre-Roe world where access depends on where you live and what kind of resources you have.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In non-pandemic times, obtaining an abortion already presented serious legal and logistical challenges for millions of women. For patients who live in certain states, getting care means enduring state-imposed waiting periods, submitting to unnecessary ultrasounds, or rushing to receive care before an arbitrary legal deadline. For patients who already have children, care must be arranged. Those without a car need a ride, especially if the nearest clinic is hours away. Some need flights to more accommodating states. And many, many need funds.

But women seeking abortions since the coronavirus outbreak began faced a new challenge — states' attempts to temporarily limit or ban abortion outright by deeming them ""non-essential"" procedures, under the pretext of preserving medical supplies for COVID-19 treatment. These restrictions collided with the travel and social distancing restrictions put in place to limit the spread of the virus, leading to an even more precarious situation for abortion care than the one already in place.

To reach one of the abortion clinics in Planned Parenthood's Rocky Mountain network, one woman had to drive 16 hours from Texas to Colorado to obtain care, Dr. Kristina Tocce, Vice President and Medical Director at Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, told Insider.

Tocce said that since February, the network, which has 24 clinics in Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Southern Nevada, has seen a tenfold increase in women seeking abortions. Some of those women traveled hundreds of miles after neighboring Texas imposed a month-long ban on the procedures, citing the need to reserve medical equipment.

Another patient, unable to find care for a disabled family member, embarked on an ""incredibly long road trip"" with a relative to reach care in Colorado, Tocce said. She drove for two days.

Many more have sought care in New Mexico. Other women have taken the now-extraordinary measure of boarding planes to Denver.

""The pandemic, and some of the bans to essential care that politicians are trying to enforce, just exacerbates unjust laws that have already been passed,"" said Odile Schalit, executive director of the Brigid Alliance, which helps women travel for abortion care.

In states unfriendly to abortion, providers have had to scramble to arrange care, and organizations that help with logistics and funding have pivoted to a war footing. But at the national level, abortion advocates worry that red states' bold actions during the pandemic are just a preview of the obstacles to come.

""I see a danger in returning to a pre-Roe world,"" Reverend Katherine Ragsdale, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, said, in reference to the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe V. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide and is perennially under legal siege.

States already unfriendly to abortion capitalized on the coronavirus pandemic to restrict care

During the outbreak, states like Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Iowa attempted to impose some sort of restriction on abortion during the coronavirus outbreak by deeming them non-essential procedures. In Texas, this ban extended to medication abortions as well as surgical ones, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Many of the initial restrictions have expired or eased, and some were struck down after legal challenges, but the episode has left women and abortion rights proponents on the defensive.

Arkansas is currently the only state that actively has abortion restrictions in place due to the coronavirus. A federal appeals court held up an initial ban on surgical abortions, but restrictions elective surgeries began to ease late last month. However, on April 27, the state's health department issued a rule that required a woman to receive a negative coronavirus test result 48 hours before an elective surgery. Arguing that this created a new hurdle to access at a time when the tests remain scarce, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the case on behalf of Arkansas' last remaining clinic but a federal judge rejected the motion on May 7, the Associated Press reported.

The states issuing or attempting these orders said that they were necessary to preserve PPE, which in some locations has been in desperately short supply as states scramble to deal with their COVID-19 outbreaks.

Around the country, Americans have had to forgo medical care. These so-called ""non-essential"" services could range in severity from dental visits to cancer treatments because of the need to preserve vital PPE.

Abortion, however, is ""a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible,"" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Board of Obstetrics & Gynecology said in a joint statement in response to the attempted bans. ""The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person's life, health, and well-being.""

And these new orders and legal battles threw the prospects for care for millions of women into flux.

The most well-known, and arguably impactful ban, was enacted in Texas this past March. On March 22, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott issued order GA-09, which halted all ""all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary."" The order didn't specifically mention abortion, but Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton clarified that these procedures were covered by the order.

The order launched a month-long battle that only ended when it expired on April 21, but not before it threw the state, and the southwest, into chaos. A total of 55,440 abortions were performed in Texas in 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, constituting more than 6% of all abortions performed nationwide that year. Abortion advocates went to court to halt the order, which resulted in some delays, but Texas ultimately prevailed, leading to 30-days of on-again, off-again abortion access in a state that already been limiting access for years.

A new order, effective April 22, allows procedures that don't deplete necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) required to combat COVID-19. Abortion is permitted once again, but providers — and women seeking abortions — are still on edge after last month's experience.

""There were several days where we started seeing patients, and a decision was made by a court or something happened where we had to stop,"" Dr. Bhavik Kumar of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston told Insider.

Kumar and his colleagues had to tell ""hundreds"" of women to go home, or spend hours on the phone re-scheduling appointments with no guarantee that they could provide care on the new date, either.

""They would ask questions like, 'where would we go?' 'What do I do now? I came here to get care.' 'What are my options?' 'Can I come back tomorrow?'"" Kumar said.. They only had two options: Tell women to wait, even knowing that the state had a 20-week abortion ban and the longer a pregnancy continued, the more expensive abortions became; or travel out of state, which could require long — and costly — drives, expensive hotel stays, and the risk potential exposure to the coronavirus.

""I've never had to do anything like that before in my career,"" Kumar said.

The experience not only placed stress on women seeking care, but the uncertainty took a ""huge emotional toll"" on the clinic staff, too, Kumar said.

""We are used to taking care of people. We make them feel better, we can answer their questions,"" he said.. ""When that's robbed of us...that leaves us feeling helpless.""

Some communities were impacted more severely than others, deepening social fault lines that already played a role in abortion access.

""It's definitely the people who struggle the most normally, and it just becomes all the more desperate now,"" Bridget Schilling of the Clinical Access Support Network (CASN), a Houston based-organization that provides funding, logistical and transportation support for women seeking abortions and often refers women to Kumar's clinic.

Even without abortion bans, the unprecedented logistical challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak have complicated abortion access.

Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Houston had to implement social distancing protocols, meaning fewer patients could be in the clinic at one time.

""Our capacity is very different than it would be outside the pandemic, and on top of that we have a lot more people who need care because there are a number of folks who have been waiting,"" Kumar said.

CASN had to temporarily suspend its volunteer driver program, which provided transportation to and from clinics, after Houston implemented its stay-at-home order. Because of safety concerns for volunteers, Schilling said, the service simply could not continue. Women who needed an abortion had to drive to neighboring states, making their travel arrangements more complicated and costly.

The Louisiana-based New Orleans Abortion Fund (NOAF), which has a similar mission to CASN, was receiving more calls, said Elizabeth Gelvin, NOAF's client services program coordinator.

NOAF has had to go to extra lengths to coordinate care for women from Louisiana, which only has three abortion clinics and already has numerous restrictions including a 20-week abortion ban.

In addition to providing funding for everything from Greyhound bus tickets, airfare, and childcare stipends, they went into overdrive helping to book hotels, and ""really figuring out the nitty gritty of where someone needs to go and how best to get them there, and how most safely to get them there.""

Women from the state often sought care in Texas, Gelvin said, but while the ban was in place that was not an option. Meanwhile, Arkansas, to the north, has also restricted the procedure.

""This new lack of access isn't going to go away quickly""

Organizations at the national level have watched states' attempts to limit abortion during the coronavirus outbreak with apprehension.

Pandemic aside, conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers have already instituted a slew of laws aimed at making it more difficult to get an abortion. Seventeen states already ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, though Supreme Court precedent keeps abortion legalized in all 50 states. Many states have tried to impose six-week bans or eliminate the procedure altogether, though these efforts invariably wind up blocked in court. Meanwhile, states like Tennessee pass flagrantly unconstitutional abortion restrictions with the hope of overturning Roe v. Wade through a legal challenge that escalates to the Supreme Court, which now has a 5-4 conservative tilt.

But during the pandemic states like Texas and Arkansas had managed to do the constitutionally impossible: temporarily halt abortions in the state, by using the coronavirus crisis as justification.

While abortion is currently available in all 50 states, organizations like the National Abortion Federation are preparing for a drawn-out fight as the pandemic continues. It could take more than a year to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus if one can be made at all. And during that time, abortion access could remain in flux.

""Those of us in touch with reality are talking about the understanding that we're not gonna suddenly be back to normal in May or June, probably for at least a year,"" said NAF's Katherine Ragsdale. ""[There's] a danger of ending up in sort of a pre-Roe world where access depends on where you live and what kind of resources you have.""

""This new lack of access,"" Ragsdale said, ""isn't going to go away quickly.""",real

Updated March 15 at 6:47 p.m. ET

Already saddled with cybersecurity risks, hiring challenges and wavering public trust, the 2020 census now must contend with a growing public health crisis.

NPR has learned that at least one U.S. Census Bureau employee — who was recently hired as a supervisor for a group of door knockers, spokesperson Michael Cook says, and has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau — has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been quarantined.

""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Cook said in an email.

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the bureau has decided to delay starting its early round of door-knocking by census workers in college towns to April 23. The bureau is also waiting until early April, instead of late March, to begin its outreach effort to send out representatives with computer tablets to help people submit their census responses online. That program, which is expected to cost at least $100 million, is designed to target people in high-traffic locations, from public transit hubs to grocery stores.

The uncertain timeline of the coronavirus outbreaks, however, could further complicate the constitutionally mandated head count of every U.S. resident. Major disruptions could derail the Census Bureau from gathering accurate numbers used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets for the next 10 years. The data also guide the redrawing of voting districts and the distribution of as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for healthcare, schools, roads and other public services to local communities.

Here's what to look for as the count — scheduled to continue through July — rolls out around the country:

The ""safest"" way to do the census is on your own

Without leaving home, you can take about 10 minutes now to submit a response on behalf of your household — either online at my2020census.gov or over the phone.

If you prefer paper, all households that haven't responded by early April are expected to receive a physical questionnaire in the mail. Some households in areas with low Internet subscription rates, and communities with higher shares of residents over age 65, are set to receive paper forms by March 20.

Those would be ""the safest"" ways to do the census because they involve little to no person-to-person contact, says John Thompson, a former Census Bureau director who left the agency in 2017.

But the key is to turn in your household's legally required response as soon as possible, Thompson adds. Otherwise, your home address is likely to be added to the list of places for census workers to visit in person beginning May 13. College students living off-campus may get a door knock starting April 23, instead of April 9, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR.

""It is critical that households understand that self-responding to the census can help alleviate additional burdens to the Bureau, brought on by COVID-19,"" Arturo Vargas, a longtime census advocate and CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, says in a written statement.

As of Saturday, 3 million households have submitted an online response to my2020census.gov since it was soft-launched on Monday, according to Cook.

""The Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. ""If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.""

Can the census be delayed?

The Census Bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through July 31. But this week, some Democratic members of Congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.

Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Adriano Espaillat — both of New York — along with 10 other Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, are urging the bureau to continue the count for an additional three months through October. A separate group of New York lawmakers led by Rep. Yvette Clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through September ""due to the social disruption caused by COVID-19.""

""Social distancing will make enumeration practically impossible during the current allotted time frame,"" Clarke and the other lawmakers wrote in a letter to Ross.

In response to the coronavirus, some tribal nations are increasing their security by limiting who can enter tribal territories, according to Lycia Maddocks, vice president of external affairs at the National Congress of American Indians.

""Some nations actually have physical guard stands where they can check to see if you're a tribal citizen,"" Maddocks, a citizen of the Quechan Tribe, said during a news conference Friday.

That could exacerbate the undercount of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who had the highest net undercount rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the 2010 census, according to the bureau's estimates. The delivery of census mailings could be delayed and census workers may not be able to travel in Indian Country, where there is often limited or no high-speed Internet service.

The bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week it's watching to see how many households respond on their own before deciding whether to continue counting past July. The bureau has said it is prepared to delay sending out census workers to specific areas where there is an outbreak.

Still, the bureau is under pressure to meet a critical deadline: Under federal law, the Census Bureau is required to deliver the latest population counts of each state to the president by Dec. 31.

""If they have to delay too long, then they would have to work with the Congress and see if they would pass a new law to extend the deadline for the census,"" Thompson, the former bureau director, says.

Asked by NPR on Thursday whether the bureau is considering making such a request to Congress, the bureau's current director, Steven Dillingham, said: ""I wouldn't take anything off the table, but that's the first mention I've heard of that possibility.""

Will the Census Bureau be able to hire and protect a half-million census workers?

The bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. These workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups — including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants — are included in the country's population count.

""Historically, Black and Latino households, among others, have lower self-response rates, which means the Census Bureau needs enough manpower in the field to collect census information in-person in these communities,"" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former House oversight subcommittee for the census, says in an email.

The bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week there has not been a significant drop in staffing since the outbreak.

But Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR that the bureau learned on Friday that the newly hired census field supervisor, who is now quarantined, tested positive for COVID-19. While that employee, who was expected to be based from home, has not engaged with the public on behalf of the bureau, Cooks says the individual interacted with other recently hired census workers and trainers during a new employee training session.

""The very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine,"" Cook says in a written statement to NPR. ""We will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.""

Cooks adds the bureau is not aware of any ""work-related public activity"" by the employees in self-quarantine.

The bureau told lawmakers that it's planning to conduct more online training sessions and give workers safety equipment. Cook tells NPR the bureau is working on including social distancing techniques in trainings for door knockers, known as enumerators, and other on-the-ground census workers. Those who feel sick are ""strongly encouraged"" to stay at home, Cook adds. Enumerators do not get sick leave, but Cook says the bureau is looking into ways to pay them for a work-related injury or illness.

Still, on Friday, the Commerce Department Office of Inspector General, an internal watchdog group for the bureau, asked the agency to provide more details by March 20 on how it plans to conduct the count at ""a time of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty.""

Thompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a ""particularly sensitive issue,"" especially among retirees over the age of 60. Given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. But now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

Kevin Dowd, 62, a retired accountant who applied for a 2020 census job and lives near Milford, Pa., says he recently decided not to attend a training session for prospective enumerators because he was worried about getting sick.

""How many people would be in how big a room?"" Dowd says he wondered. ""Many people have come back from vacation, from places that have more cases, and so I decided that I didn't need the $16 an hour.""

How will the homeless population be counted?

The bureau may decide next week to push back its schedule for counting people experiencing homelessness who are staying in shelters, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR. That count is currently set for March 30 through April 1.

The agency is also evaluating whether to delay its April 1 count of homeless people living outside of shelters and in public parks, under bridges and other outdoor locations.

Shelters can choose to have a census worker visit their facility to interview residents and other people who use their services. But rising health concerns about COVID-19 raise two potential challenges, Thompson, the former bureau director, says.

""Workers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services,"" Thompson says. ""The places could be reluctant to let people in.""

Cook says the agency is trying to contact facilities that had planned for an in-person count to ask whether they can switch to paper forms instead.

In New York City — home to the country's largest homeless population — census workers are not expected to visit city-owned shelters because the local department of social services is transferring records about the shelters' residents to the Census Bureau, Julie Menin, the city's census director, tells NPR.

""What this really does is ensures that every single homeless person in New York City is properly counted,"" Menin says. ""We don't want anyone to be overlooked. We don't want anyone to be invisible.""

How will college students, nursing home residents and prisoners be counted?

Cook says the bureau is trying to encourage 68,000 nursing homes, prisons and other group living facilities, excluding college dorms, to send in information about their residents online or by paper, rather than waiting for a census worker to do in-person interviews starting in early April.

Close to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. Given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.

The canceling of in-person classes and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.

In general, the bureau says all U.S. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on Census Day (April 1). This week, the bureau confirmed to NPR that students who have left their college town because of coronavirus should still use their address at school when filling out a census form.

But it's not clear if that guidance will reach students who have scattered around the country, some scrambling to find last-minute housing. In a letter to the Department of Education, the bureau suggests that schools contact their students who usually live off-campus about how to get counted on their own using my2020census.gov.

How will community groups help promote the census?

For decades, the bureau has relied on parades, street festivals and worship services as opportunities for local community leaders to encourage participation in the census.

""The person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail,"" says Nancy Potok, a former deputy director at the Census Bureau who recently retired as the chief statistician of the U.S.

But the coronavirus is forcing census advocates to pivot away from in-person outreach activities. John Park, executive director of the MinKwon Center — a community group based in Queens, N.Y. — says his organization has been scaling down door-knocking and ramping up texting and phone-banking to encourage households to fill out the census on their own.

""We've created multi-lingual T-shirts with QR codes that link to the census self-response URL, which will let people keep their distance but still access the survey,"" Park says in an email.

Still, for now, the bureau plans to move forward with its outreach efforts through its ""Mobile Questionnaire Assistance"" program after delaying the initial rollout from March 30 to April 6, Cook tells NPR. By April 13, census workers are expected to fan out with computer tablets around the country in areas with low census response rates to help people get counted online.

Will the coronavirus shut down census call centers and processing centers for paper forms?

While the bureau hopes most households use my2020census.gov, it's still collecting paper questionnaires, which are a critical backstop in case of any major technical breakdowns with the online census form.

""One area that people tend to overlook is the importance of the processing centers,"" Potok, the former deputy director of the bureau, says about the two data processing centers in Phoenix and Jeffersonville, Ind., which is across the river from Louisville, Ky., for the 2020 census. ""People need to be there to check in the questionnaires.""

The centers can receive, separate and scan as many as 30 million paper questionnaires for the 2020 census, according to the bureau's plan for its paper data capture operation. Processing those paper forms will help the bureau figure out where they need to send workers to follow up with unresponsive households.

Deb Stempowski, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of operations and schedules for the 2020 census, says if there are any interruptions at one of the sites, the other center could pick up the extra work. Stempowski adds the bureau is tracking paper forms that are mailed back as soon as they enter the mail stream, and the agency is prepared to ask employees to work longer shifts or on the weekends if needed.

""I don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers,"" Stempowski said.

Still, there is a risk of both facilities having to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.

The pandemic could also complicate staffing at the call centers that are receiving census responses over the phone and answering questions about the count in 13 languages. The 10 census questionnaire assistance centers are located in Tempe, Ariz.; Pueblo, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Tamarac, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; New York City; Blytheville, S.C.; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; and Nashville, Tenn.

""We have a significant contingency budget in place, which enables us to move offices if needed,"" Cook tells NPR, referring to a $2 billion budget set aside for 2020 census emergencies.

Will the coronavirus force the bureau to rely more heavily on government records to fill in missing information?

If the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.

""It is possible that administrative records will have to enumerate a much larger share of the population as the virus spreads,"" Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director who oversaw the 2000 count, wrote in an op-ed this week in The New York Times.

Some critics worry that relying on records to complete demographic profiles of certain households may not produce accurate census information.

""We find these records work well in matching records for the White and higher-income populations but racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income persons, and other HTC populations are likely to be missed,"" members of a working group of Census Bureau researchers and advisors to the bureau wrote in a 2016 report.

Before the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households — or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census — will be counted using administrative records, according to a regulatory document filed in January with the White House's Office of Management and Budget.

Bureau officials said in the document that if the bureau ""does not have confidence"" in the records for an unresponsive household because of missing or inconsistent data, they plan to continue sending census workers to knock on the door.

According to the bureau's plans, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. At a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.",real

After having stayed away from Trump-branded golf courses since all the way back in the beginning of March, President Donald Trump visited one of his golf courses in north Virginia this Saturday. NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell reported:

‘The president was spotted by pool in white hat, white shirt and the motorcade has left the WH compound. Could this be his first golf outing since early March during stay at Mar-A-Lago? More to come.’

Indeed — the trip was apparently not announced ahead of time, but yes, Trump ended up visiting one of his golf courses this Saturday morning. The Trump Organization started the process of reopening their golf courses in early May. They’d been closed amidst the national social distancing demands meant to help stem the spread of the Coronavirus. Trump has consistently seemed eager to lift those social distancing demands, no matter the potential ensuing negative effects on public health — and it’s definitely not beyond the current president for concern about getting back on the golf course to have driven his eagerness to dismiss public health guidelines. At one point, he even tweeted that his followers should “liberate” certain states that were under stay-at-home guidelines — including the state of Virginia, where his golf course that he visited this weekend is located.

Condemnation for the president promptly poured in. As political commentator Jon Favreau put it:

‘Trump won’t do anything else to stop a virus that’s killed 100,000 Americans. He won’t do anything else to fix an economy where 40 million are out of work. He will golf, though!’

Still, for some, where there’s a crisis, there’s a profit to be made.

As the world continues to face the grim social and economic realitities of a coronavirus-ridden world, and the US alone faces a staggering 39 million lost jobs since March, a select few group of billionaires has managed not only to keep their heads above water, but take advantage of bearish market conditions to add billions to their fortunes.

Among these fortunate few is famed investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate holding company sold a whopping 84 percent of its stake in Goldman Sachs last quarter, earning $3 billion+ in cash, 12 years after investing in the bank to help bail it out during the 2008 financial crisis. The earnings included $1.2 billion in dividends, plus over $1.4 billion from the stock selloff.

George Soros, the US Hungarian-born financier with a penchant for meddling in the affairs of foreign nations going to back to the 1980s, made some bold market moves of his own in the past couple of months, purchasing a $5 million stake in Disney, and increasing his investment in US exercise equipment and media company Peloton by more than ten-fold, to $79 million, while continuing to build shares in real estate investment trust AGNC by 22 percent, with total holdings now worth $21 million. During the same period, Soros added 1.7 million shares to his holdings of Alberta-based energy company Cenovus Energy (with total shares now worth $7 million+, and NiSource, Inc, a gas and electricity holding company operating across seven US states, with total investments of over $6.7 million. Overall, the string of share buys is expected to net Soros Fund Management between 3 and 11.5 percent dividends in the coming months, not a bad deal considering most of the world’s central banks have switched to sub-zero bond rates in recent months. In addition to the above-mentioned operations, Soros’ hedge fund has also been busy buying, selling, adding, dumping, and researching dozens more companies in operations worth hundreds of millions of dollars during the first quarter of 2020.

Then there’s Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, already the wealthiest man alive, who has reportedly added another $25 billion to his fortune since the start of 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns have led millions of Americans to turn to Amazon for entertainment and sustenance, and the stock price of his company to grow accordingly. Amid skyrocketing revenues of $75.5 billion in Q1 2020 (up from $59.7 billion a year earlier), business media have been speculating that, if current trends continue, Bezos could become the world’s first trillionaire sometime in the next decade. So fantastical is Bezos’ Midas touch of profit-making that even his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos, who became the third richest woman in the world after divorcing him in 2019 with a $35 billion settlement, that her wealth too has reportedly grown by $8.6 billion over the past four months alone.

Who Will Be the Next Multibillionaire? As the coronavirus crisis continues to wreak havoc on global health care systems and the world economy, biotech companies around the world are rushing to develop a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Kalorama Information, a New York-based market analytics firm, estimates that there are over 75 vaccine candidates around the world, five of them already undergoing clinical trials. Needless to say, whoever wins the ‘race’ to the vaccine will have the best chance of raking in the big bucks, as governments will begin buying up billions of doses for immunization programmes. Kalorama says based on previous experience with influenza vaccines, which generated $5.2 billion in revenues in 2018, COVID-19 could generate between $8 billion and $10 billion dollars in demand in the first full year of implementation alone. Among the major candidates are CanSino Biologics, a Chinese vaccine company already engaged in human trials, US biotech company Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals (the company supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), and the Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute, another Chinese entity which is working on two separate coronavirus-related vaccine preparations.",fake

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a large-scale outbreak. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 because the viruses have high genetic similarity. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 represses the repair function and defense ability of lung macrophages, causes severe respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage, and even immediately causes death of infected patients.

COVID-19 and its First Line of Defense - Macrophages

Lung macrophages are important immune cells that protect against foreign pathogens when the lungs face bacteria and virus infection by using phagocytosis. Therefore, lung macrophages digest, degrade and remove these foreign objects and further activate the adaptive immune system to fight against unknown infection. Mitochondria are a major contributors to phagocytosis when macrophages remove the virus invasion. Mitochondria provide energy for the macrophage to increase their viability and produce reactive oxygen species to kill the virus. If the mitochondria in macrophage are damaged or cannot function normally, it will be insufficient to defend against the invasion of foreign viruses. Therefore, it is an important issue to maintaining immune system by keeping mitochondrial function when virus infection.

What does the Latest Research say about Mitochondrial Programs for Macrophage Support?

Originally, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as atypical pneumonia from China in late 2002. This highly contagious respiratory disease, with an 8 to 15% death rate, rapidly spread to other countries within Asia and to other continents, causing devastating social, economic, and medical impact worldwide. The causative agent of SARS has been, after intense research, identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. The transmission of this deadly virus is thought to be mediated through virus-laden droplets but also via either small-particle aerosol or fecal-oral routes, with the lungs as its main pathological target.

IL-6 and IL-8 are critical SARS-CoV-induced Calu-3 cell cytokines responsible, in part, for inhibiting the ability of DC to prime naïve T cells. Aliquots of DC were incubated with M-10 medium alone in the presence of control Ab and specific neutralizing Abs against IL-6, IL-8, or IP-10. Additionally, they were incubated with appropriate doses of recombinant IL-6, recombinant IL-8, or recombinant IP-10. After cultivation for 3 days, DC were harvested to assess the proliferation of naïve T cells in a standard MLR. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test was used to determine the level of statistical significance. Data presented are collected from at minimum two independent experiments.

Dynamito® - Improved Mitochondrial Protection of Macrophages

Mitochondrion Applied Technology Co. Ltd. have discovered a beneficial ingredient for mitochondrial activation, screened form dozens of unique chinese medicinal materials in Taiwan. Dynamito MAPEs®, is a mitochondrial activation factor, extracted from these natural herbs by using our patented technology that has been granted many efficacy patents, approved from Taiwan, the USA, Japan, China and many other countries. Studies have demonstrate that Dynamito MAPEs ® can activate and protect the macrophages mitochondria, helping macrophages to establish the first line of defense when the human body against foreign unknown viruses (such as new coronaviruses and new influenza viruses) to avoid further lung damage, and improve macrophage function as well as body protection.

Specifically, antioxidant aim is to reduce the free radicals on the body tissue attack caused by injury or disease. Researchers used single plant extracts to conduct antioxidant testing, and the compounding of plant extracts; when compared to the composite plant extracts, it was found that the antioxidant capacity increased significantly. The cytoplasmic function of the cells was not destroyed by the hydrogen peroxide, and when compared to the control group the concentration of phyllanthus emblica, red polyphenol and green tea polyphenol in the compositions of the present invention were 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively, the base energy of cytoskeletal cells increased by 1.13 fold when the concentration of the composition was 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml, respectively, the energy produced by ATP increased by a factor of 1.6 times; and the energy used to cope with the stress was increased by 2.7times, energy per unit of linear body increased by 1.3 times, and the energy efficiency of oxygen consumption increased by 1.4 times. In addition, the occurrence of free radical leakage was also reduced by 44.3%.

Experiments clearly show that the free radicals involved in the energy production of the cells are effectively neutralized by many of the free radicals of our complexed plant extracts, and this action defends part of the free attack on body tissues. The intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly enhanced, as well as increasing the number of stem cells.

With the advent of an aging society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to aging and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

On Tuesday, however, Central Michigan got there.

Central Michigan became the first Division I school in the state to eliminate an athletic program as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the immediate discontinuation of men's indoor and outdoor track and field — a decision that will save the university hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but also one that leaves the athletic department out of compliance, having fallen under the minimum number of men's sports offerings.

Central Michigan has cut its men's indoor and outdoor track programs. (Photo: Central Michigan athletics)

The move affects 36 student-athletes, some of whom also run cross country, a program that remains.

""Every business, every industry is going through this right now,"" Alford said Tuesday afternoon on a conference call with reporters. ""As you come up with problems and issues, you've gotta find a solution.

""Right now, for our financial sustainability, this is the decision, the solution I came to.

""As an AD, it's probably the hardest thing of your life.""

Scholarships will be granted for the duration of a student's college career, if they choose to stay at CMU, and that includes incoming freshmen. Students who wish to transfer can do so without penalty. Two assistant-coaching positions also were eliminated.

Jenny Swieton oversaw the men's programs, and will remain on the job as head of women's track and field and men's and women's cross country.

The men's indoor and outdoor track and field programs had an annual budget of $629,798, which will be the long-time annual savings. In the short term, savings will be around $300,000 a year.

The decision leaves Central Michigan with 16 sports programs, the NCAA Division I minimum. Early in the COVID-19 crisis, five mid-major conferences, including the Mid-American Conference, sent the NCAA a memo asking for a temporary waiver for sports minimums, but the NCAA denied it.

It also leaves Central Michigan with five men's teams, one below the NCAA Division I requirement. Alford has been working with the NCAA on a temporary waiver, and expects an answer soon, perhaps as early as Wednesday. If the NCAA doesn't approve the waiver, Alford said he has a fallback plan, but didn't elaborate.

""I have various models to make sure we're in full compliance this year,"" Alford said.

Colleges across the country have been scrambling to get their books in order amid the COVID-19 crisis, which has shut down sports for sevearl weeks and left athletic departments bracing for massive cuts. The cancellation of the NCAA Tournament cost mid-major schools like Central critical six-figure paydays. Projected declining enrollment is a major concern, as well.

Earlier this month, Central Michigan announced that Alford was taking an 8% pay cut, and the school's three highest-paid coaches — Jim McElwain (football), Keno Davis (men's basketball) and Heather Oesterle (women's basketball) — would see 6% pay cuts. Western Michigan recently announced similar pay cuts, and also Tuesday, Eastern Michigan said its football and basketball coaches would get 7% salary reductions.

Central Michigan joins other Mid-American Conference schools Akron (men's cross country, men's golf, women's tennis) and Bowling Green (baseball) in cutting sports. Additionally, the MAC announced the elimination of several postseason conference tournaments, and scaled-down basketball tournaments.

Alford said there are no plans to cut additional sports teams, but also said there's little to no chance of men's track ever being brought back, even if the financial outlook improves in the coming years.

In his conference call with reporters, Alford choked up multiple times talking about the student athletes.

""We've been trying to make it work,"" said Alford, who has been bouncing between six and seven different budget models. ""It's just impossible to make it work without this reduction.""

The last Division I school in Michigan to eliminate teams was Eastern in March 2018, axing men's swimming and diving and wrestling, and women's tennis and softball. A lengthy court case forced Eastern to reinstate women's tennis, and it is in the process of adding women's lacrosse to substitute for softball.

The stress, panic, and anxiety over the global pandemic has spawned an array of sleep disorders, from insomnia to irregular sleep patterns to sleeping more than normal. Add in schedule changes brought on by working from home, trying to home school children, and stay entertained while isolating at home, and sleep is quickly becoming yet another casualty of COVID-19, even among those who normally don’t struggle with sleep.

Unfortunately, the lifestyle changes that the pandemic response demands are leading many people to engage in behaviors that are counterproductive to their sleep. After all, when you don’t have to get up early for work or school, there’s no reason not to binge on “Tiger King” or the newest season of “Ozark.” Even if you aren’t getting caught up in a television series, it’s likely that your days aren’t following their typical rhythm. Instead of working from 8 to 5, you may be spending your evenings catching up on remote work and sleep takes a backseat.

The good news is that this pandemic won’t last forever. The bad news is that the longer we’re faced with shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, the more challenging it may be to return to normal routines. For that reason, it’s important to develop good habits for coping with stress and anxiety -- and that includes maintaining good sleep habits.

In fact, maintaining good sleep habits can even help you maintain immunity to illness. Studies show that people who don’t get enough sleep are more likely to get sick when exposed to a virus, so following these tips for managing your anxiety and getting sleep can help you weather this crisis and return to normal more successfully.

6 Ways to Sleep When You Have Coronavirus Anxiety

Maintain a Consistent Routine

As much as you can, try to maintain your typical sleep routine, going to bed and waking at your normal times. As tempting as it is to stay in bed, maintaining your regular patterns can help you retain a sense of normalcy that reduces stress, and ensures you maintain a healthy sleep cycle. Not to mention, when the restrictions are lifted, staying on your normal cycle ensures you won’t have to reestablish your old patterns later.

Keep Work Out of the Bedroom

One of the foundations of good sleep hygiene is to reserve the bedroom for sleep and sex only, and avoid working, watching television, or other activities. Avoid working in your bedroom (especially in bed) to keep work and sleep separate and avoid creating associations with stress that keep you awake.

Stay Active

You may not be able to keep up with your normal fitness routine right now, but that doesn’t mean you should turn into a couch potato. Staying active not only helps regulate your sleep cycle, it also releases feel-good brain chemicals that can help you better manage your anxiety and stress. Take a walk, have a family dance party, or tackle some yard work outdoors to burn off excess energy and get your mind off of the news for a while.

Turn Off the News

The news these days is often grim, and following the daily briefings, updates, and predictions can send even the most level-headed person into a tailspin of anxiety and panic. And it’s not just information overload that’s contributing to sleep disruption. When you spend hours glued to your devices looking for updates, the increased levels of blue light disrupt your body’s natural melatonin production, ultimately making it more difficult to sleep.

To keep your feelings under control while staying informed, set boundaries regarding news consumption. For example, consider only watching the news for updates in the early morning or dinner hour, and stick to broadcasts that focus on the headlines, not opinion or interpretation. Avoid consuming the news before bed, which can keep you awake.

Learn New Coping Strategies

Many of the common strategies we use to deal with stress, such as getting together with friends or shopping, are off-limits at this time. Use this time to develop new strategies, such as trying a new hobby like painting or jigsaw puzzles, or tackle that stack of books you’ve been meaning to read. You might even find hobbies that you will continue after the emergency ends.

Don’t Worry About Sleep

It sounds counterintuitive, but worrying about your sleep only makes it more difficult to sleep. When you’re anxious about sleep, it only creates more stress. If you’re having trouble sleeping, focus on maintaining your normal schedule and stress reduction, rather than forcing yourself to sleep. When you get into bed, don’t make sleep your goal, but rather relaxation. Again, limiting your news consumption before bed and making that time “me time” to relax with a warm bath or shower, some light stretching, and some light entertainment (like reading a book) can help you get into a good place to sleep.

Above all, remember that this crisis is temporary. It may seem endless right now, but eventually the emergency will pass and life will return to some semblance of normal. Keeping perspective, and doing everything you can to stay healthy will help you weather the storm.

Updated at 2 p.m. ET

Retail spending is in a free fall — nosediving a record 8.7% last month — as more companies continue to furlough workers and stores, malls and restaurants remain shuttered across the country during the coronavirus pandemic.

The March drop was the largest monthly fall since the Commerce Department began tracking retail sales three decades ago. The previous record was a 3.9% drop in November 2008, during the Great Recession.

Americans are still spending a fair amount on food and online deliveries, but not enough to offset the massive drops in shopping for clothes and accessories (down a stunning 50.5%) and furniture (down 26.8%). Spending on autos, parts and gasoline also plummeted.

Economists are warning that April might show an even bigger decline in retail spending as shutdowns continue — and in some areas didn't begin in earnest until late March.

Best Buy, for example, said on Wednesday that it's temporarily furloughing 51,000 workers, including almost all part-time store workers. It's retaining 82% of the chain's hourly full-time store workforce, but many other retailers have fared worse. Macy's and other department stores have temporarily closed and furloughed millions of workers. J.C. Penney is considering filing for bankruptcy, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Consumer spending is by far the biggest driver of economic activity, which means all eyes will be on U.S. shoppers to see how quickly their spending may bounce back with potential pent-up demand — or what chains and businesses might not survive the pandemic.

It was reported that police have been warning of the danger to children from predators online especially now during the coronavirus lockdown which keeps people indoors. Between late March and late April, Scotland Yard claimed that almost 100 children were targeted in London alone.

Some have pointed out that curiously, no information other than age appears to have been given out concerning the arrested men. Given the UK’s abysmal history with foreign rape gangs, overwhelmingly composed of Muslim men from Middle Eastern and Asian countries, this may mean this is just another instance in a depressingly steady pattern.

Bradford, described as “multicultural” by Breitbart, was the location of yet another case of child grooming gangs, according to a report from 2018. Of the suspects, 63% were of Pakistani background, and many others from other Asian and African countries, with only a minority being “white British.”

Police also reportedly seized over 60 devices which were used both to exploit children online and store indecent pictures.

According to a detective chief inspector, “Targeted operations like these demonstrate that we take the online sexual exploitation of children in Bradford District seriously and that we will take action against offenders and safeguard those children they have attempted to exploit.”

Unfortunately, the UK’s record on the competency and will of its police in dealing with foreign rape gangs does not inspire confidence. Indeed, tragically, there have been multiple cases of cops themselves participating in the abuse of minors.

Despite the nature of the offences and the stated urgency of the issue, as well as the statements of police praising their own actions, for reasons not clear all of the men were released under investigation or bailed shortly after having been taken into custody, and are presumably roaming free once again as inquiries continue.

This, along with the lack of transparency surrounding the case, certainly does not inspire confidence that British children are being protected as they should be. Unfortunately, even the current Conservative government has proven itself feckless and unwilling to truly tackle or even honestly address this issue which is of such dire and tragic consequence to the most vulnerable of its own citizens.",fake

The abuse of the H1B visa system to replace American workers with cheaper and more compliant foreign visa workers is both extensive and well documented within the technology industry. The visa structure keeps its recipients dependent on their employer for legal status within the country, creating a form of de facto indentured servitude in which employers have near-complete control over the workers they sponsor for the visas.

The Broadway lights are permanently going dark for the popular Disney musical ""Frozen,"" based on the 2013 Oscar-winning animated film.

The heartbreaking news was made Thursday as Thomas Schumacher, president and producer of Disney Theatrical Productions, confirmed the beloved musical will not return when Broadway reopens.

Citing the ""industry-wide shutdown and resulting economic fallout"" of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic as the cause of the shuttering, Schumacher announced in a statement that ""'Frozen,' like all shows, is wholly dependent on those who create and perform them but this was an uncommonly close and talented group and they’ll be missed.""

The Broadway staple opened March 22, 2018, and ran for 825 performances. When the curtains fell on March 11, 2020, nobody knew that performance was going to be the musical's final bow on Broadway.

Not only does this signify Broadway's first permanent closure due to the novel coronavirus, the news sets an uncertain future for many musicals considering how successful ""Frozen"" was.

Over 1.3 million people turned up to watch Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff on the stage; the musical grossed over $150 million during its nearly two-year run. It was also nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award.

""I have to acknowledge our incredible audiences; night after night, the fans showed us how much they loved this show and we look forward to seeing them at 'Frozen' around the world,"" Schumacher concluded.

Tickets for the Broadway musical purchased via Ticketmaster will be refunded. Those who used other channels to secure tickets should contact their vendor.

While its run on Broadway has come to an end, a future North American tour for ""Frozen"" is in the works. In addition, starting next year, the Disney musical will open in Australia, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.

Chesa Boudin's radical leftist parents were imprisoned when he was a toddler. Now he's working to reduce the inmate population in San Francisco — and worrying about his dad, who remains in prison.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's difficult or impossible to practice social distancing in an overcrowded prison, which is dangerous not only for the people who are incarcerated but also for the guards and other prison staff and for the families and communities they return home to. This is an issue of special concern for my guest, San Francisco's new DA Chesa Boudin. He's concerned about the health of prisoners in San Francisco jails and about the health of his 75-year-old father David Gilbert, who's in prison in New York. In 1981, Gilbert and Chesa's mother, Kathy Boudin, who were radical leftists, were arrested for driving the getaway car in a botched armed robbery of a Brink's truck. Two police officers and a guard were shot to death.

Chesa Boudin was 14 months old when his parents started serving time. He was raised by his parents' friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who were part of the radical group the Weather Underground, lived underground for years and later became educators active in education reform. Kathy Boudin was released on parole the same year that Chesa Boudin was leaving Yale for Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. That was in 2003. Chesa Boudin is now one of a growing number of DA's advocating reforms in the criminal justice system to reduce mass incarceration and address the racial and economic inequities in the system.

Chesa Boudin, welcome to FRESH AIR. How is your father?

CHESA BOUDIN: My father, David Gilbert, is incarcerated in a New York state prison. He's 75 years old, and I suppose he's doing well under the circumstances. As you're aware, the CDC has set a marker for high-risk in the context of COVID-19 at the age of 60, but it's sort of an arbitrary number. And we know that the risk grows exponentially as people get older. At 75 years old, having served nearly 40 years in prison, my dad is in a very high-risk category. He also has a number of underlying medical conditions that increase his risk.

And when he arrived in his current prison just a few months ago, there was not a single doctor on staff. We know that at least one guard in his prison has tested positive for COVID-19, and although it hasn't been in the news, I am told that at least five people have been hospitalized, inmates living in his prison with symptoms - fever, cough, et cetera - all associated with the coronavirus. Folks in the prison are being told that outside hospitals will no longer accept people coming from the prison and that the prison plans to use the gym as a triage center to hold up to 50 people if they become symptomatic.

So I am very concerned about my father. I think most people in the country right now are concerned about their elderly parents, but the conditions that my father's incarceration imposes on him make social distancing, good hygiene and access to emergency medical care basically impossible.

GROSS: He's in a single cell, but the cell is so small, it's still impossible to practice social distancing. Would you describe the problem?

BOUDIN: That's right. My father's lucky compared to most people who are incarcerated in that he does have his own cell. But, as is often the case, it's not a closed cell. It has an open wall of bars that opens onto a pathway adjoining numerous other individually celled inmates, and so there's no way to be fully six feet away from other inmates. The toilets are right up against the bars on the corridor. And so when any inmate is using the toilet, they're up against an open - essentially an open wall of bars. And there are so many people in the prison and on the particular cell block that social distancing is entirely impossible.

In addition, access to food, access to any other kinds of activities within the prison require moving, usually in large groups, from one place to another. And so it's for those reasons, among others, that medical professionals have been pointing out the extreme risks that jails and prisons pose not just to the people who are incarcerated there, like my father, but also to all of the correctional officers, sheriff's deputies, public health officials and staff who work in jails and prisons.

GROSS: So I know in the early days of the pandemic, you were worried about your father using the phone in prison, because there's, like, one phone for his unit. It doesn't work great, so you basically have to put your mouth really close to the phone in order to be heard. And, of course, that violates all the ways you're supposed to protect yourself against either transmitting or getting the virus. I don't know if that's even an option for him now. I mean, is the prison in lockdown? Does he even have access to a phone?

BOUDIN: My father does have some access to phones. It's different and more limited than his usual access. He is, at my request, taking extreme precaution when he uses the phone and, frankly, every time he leaves his cell. We are very worried about his health because of his underlying medical conditions and because of the fact that we know people in his prison have tested positive. It's one of the things that makes this period all the more frightening for us as a family of someone who's incarcerated - is lack of communication. He does still use the phone, and I have been able to talk to him about once a week, which I'm appreciative of and thankful for. But every time he uses the phone, he's quite literally taking his life in his hands.

GROSS: So I know you're worried about your father, who is in a New York prison. As the DA of San Francisco, you're concerned about the San Francisco County Jail, too. So how big is the outbreak in the jail in San Francisco?

BOUDIN: We've taken bold, aggressive action to make sure that there is not an outbreak in the San Francisco County Jail. San Francisco and the Bay Area, I think we're way ahead of the curve nationally in terms of taking bold measures to prevent the spread of the disease. And the same is true within San Francisco's county jail. As district attorney, public safety is my primary responsibility. And right now we recognize that the single biggest threat to public safety in San Francisco, as across the globe, is COVID-19. And what we need to do is let medical professionals guide public policy. It's what I wish the president of the United States would do, and it's what I'm trying to do to the extent possible with the San Francisco County Jail and criminal justice system.

The director of jail medical has made it very clear in writing, and repeatedly, that we need to reduce the jail population in order to avert disaster. And she's even given us a target number that she wants us to reduce the jail population to. What we've done is we've reduced the county jail population since I took office in January by nearly 40%. That has created the conditions for the jail medical team to implement some level of social distancing, to isolate people who are incarcerated who show symptoms, to find ways to actually meet the medical needs of folks who have other medical conditions besides COVID-19 who are housed in the jail. And in doing so, at least to date, we have managed to avert what could be a really catastrophic outcome. No one wants short-term, pre-trial incarceration to turn into a death sentence.

GROSS: So you've reduced the inmate population in the San Francisco jail by about 40%, and I think the number is now approximately, like, 750, 760, something like that. What did you do to reduce the population?

BOUDIN: Basically, what we did, Terry, was we analyzed the entire jail population in numerous different segments or slices. We came up with lists of people who met certain criteria that we wanted to focus on, either identifying for release or finding ways to expedite their release, if possible. So for example, we looked at inmates who were elderly. We looked at inmates who were incarcerated for misdemeanors. We looked at inmates who had been conserved and were simply in jail waiting for placement in an appropriate mental health facility. We looked at veterans. We looked at people who were being held simply because of their inability to pay a low bail amount. We looked at people who had already been sentenced and had an upcoming release date in the next couple of months. We looked at people who were incarcerated just because of a technical violation of probation or parole and so on.

One of the things that's interesting that we found in this process, Terry, is that it is, in fact, possible to safely and quickly decarcerate. We found a lot of people who, it turns out, shouldn't have really been incarcerated in the first place. For example, we had a mother who was conserved and was simply waiting for placement in an appropriate mental health facility. We were able to get her placement expedited rather than having her wait in jail for months on end, as is often the case. We had another young woman with a high-risk pregnancy with no criminal record, who was in jail on a misdemeanor. With our reentry partners, we were able to get that expecting mother into a prenatal care facility where she can stay safely until her birth.

Those are the kinds of people that make me wonder whether we were doing enough before this epidemic to reduce the jail population and to reduce our reliance on incarceration as a first response to so many of our social problems.

GROSS: So you are an advocate of criminal justice reform. And among the reforms that you have advocated and begun to undertake is changing the bail system so that, instead of cash bail, whether you get to stay out of jail while you're awaiting trial is based on risk and not on wealth. How far are you along in trying to do that in San Francisco?

BOUDIN: The problem with money bail, for those who aren't familiar with it, is that it puts a price tag on freedom. It says to someone who is wealthy that no matter how dangerous you are, you can buy your way out. And it says to someone who is poor that no matter how frivolous the charges against you - no matter how innocent you may be, no matter how strong your ties to the community and how low risk you may be, because of your poverty, you're going to languish behind bars.

In San Francisco, I am proud to say that one of my first mandates as district attorney was that my staff would never ask the court to impose money bail. If we believe someone is too dangerous to be released, then it doesn't matter how wealthy they are - we should ask the court to detain them. And if we believe that someone can safely be released to their community, then we should ask the court for whatever conditions or orders are necessary to ensure public safety with that person being released, consistent with the presumption of innocence, consistent with the Supreme Court mandate that liberty is the norm.

GROSS: William Barr, attorney general, has expanded early release of inmates in prisons that have large outbreaks in Louisiana, Connecticut and Ohio. But he also wrote, the last thing our massively overburdened police forces need right now is the indiscriminate release of thousands of prisoners into the streets without any verification that those prisoners will follow the laws when released. Do you share his concerns?

BOUDIN: Well, when framed that way, I do share it. But I think the key here is indiscriminate. What we're doing in San Francisco and what we're doing with other criminal justice partners across the state and across the country is anything but indiscriminate. We are being careful. We are being focused and surgical in our efforts to decrease the jail population. We are identifying people - people like my father, frankly - who are extremely low risk, who present no risk of public safety. When you see people like that who are incarcerated not because of a public safety risk but simply because of a commitment to vengeance and a punitive approach to criminal justice, you realize that we can quickly and safely reduce our jail and prison populations.

And so what we're doing in San Francisco is not releasing people who are committing crimes but rather people who can safely be released with the right supervision, the right support, the right structures. And we see that in the statistics on the street. Compared to March of 2019, this past month has seen a decrease in crime of approximately 40%. So we're both decreasing the jail population and seeing a parallel decrease in crime rates.

GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is San Francisco's new DA Chesa Boudin. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAN AUERBACH SONG, ""HEARTBROKEN, IN DISREPAIR"")

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new DA, who's dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the city's criminal justice system.

You're an advocate and a practitioner of criminal justice reform. Your parents spent decades in prison. Your father's still in prison, and your mother was released on parole in 2003. Your mother's father - your maternal grandfather - was Leonard Boudin, a pretty famous civil liberties lawyer. And his clients included Julian Bond, Paul Robeson, Benjamin Spock, Daniel Ellsberg. Do you think having, like, parents who were in prison, guardians who raised you who were radical leftists who lived underground for a while, then having a grandfather who was a civil liberties lawyer - do you think that whole constellation of family is what motivated you to dedicate your life to criminal justice reform?

BOUDIN: Politics has always been personal for me. You know, growing up, I was in a very politically conscious household. We engaged with intellectuals and artists and academics from around the world who were thinking critically about politics and the intersection of politics and public life. My earliest memories are going through prison gates and metal detectors just to give my parents a hug. So I've been directly impacted by the criminal justice system and by the choices my parents made, which were politically motivated in many ways, since before I can remember.

So I absolutely think that that life experience, that my family history, shaped my personal and professional choices. And I think it gives me an insight into the difficult decisions I need to make as district attorney that is often missing from policymakers in the criminal justice sphere. Recognizing the complexity, the full humanity and the potential of every single person that we prosecute is a really critical and often missing component of criminal justice in this country.

And, by the same token, recognizing that we do not do nearly enough for crime victims - focusing on punishment and retribution is not healing the harm that victims have suffered, and it's also failing to rehabilitate people who commit crimes. And that's why we have such high recidivism rates, and it's why we have such high dissatisfaction rates with people in communities that are impacted by crime. Those realizations for me have and will always be intimate, personal.

GROSS: So your parents were convicted of being part of an armed robbery of a Brink's truck in 1981 that resulted in the death of two police officers and one guard. I mean, it is really so tragic that these three people died. What was the political motivation for doing this armed robbery? And once you have guns, there's always the likelihood somebody is going to get killed even if you didn't plan on taking any life. You're holding up a truck of money and robbing it with police officers. I mean, the odds of a shootout are pretty high. So what were they thinking? Do you know?

BOUDIN: I was 14 months old, and I was at the babysitter when this happened. I couldn't even talk. I had no idea, of course, what my parents were doing that day. But let me first start by saying that I condemn the crime my parents participated in. I mourn the loss of life that that crime caused. And I know and think about all the time the fact that the three families that lost their husband, their father, their loved one, will never, ever be made whole. Nothing I can do or my parents can do will ever bring those three men back.

It's also important to remember that, while my parents did play a role in the crime, neither of my parents was armed. Neither one of them was actually even at the scene of the robbery itself. They were getaway car drivers. And that doesn't mean they lack responsibility. It doesn't mean that it was improper for them to be punished and held accountable. It was. But I think it's also important that we remember and recognize the particular role that each individual person plays in a crime. We do it in virtually every area of criminal law.

The fact that my parents weren't armed, the fact that my father is literally the only person from that crime who is still incarcerated today even though he was not a shooter, even though he was not armed, is problematic. It's disproportionate. And it does not get us closer to bringing those three men back. It's a tragedy that I know weighs heavily on him every day of his life. He has, as long as I can remember, expressed his remorse for what he was part of, for the mistakes that he made and for the ways in which his political commitment to racial justice led him to participate in such a tragic and misguided crime.

GROSS: So do you understand what your parents' political motivation was when they participated in the armed robbery?

BOUDIN: My parents were shaped by the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, and my parents were inspired by Martin Luther King and by Malcolm X and by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the Deep South. They were inspired by and active in Students for a Democratic Society, campus organizing against the Vietnam War. They were inspired by movements which were primarily nonviolent.

By the time they participated in the Brink's robbery in 1981, they'd been living underground and were really out of touch with the current political trends and with, I think, the organizations that were - and the people and the leaders that were still doing nonviolent political organizing work. My parents were motivated by a commitment to anti-racism and to social change. But what they participated in, if anything, set those goals and those movements back.

GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new DA, who's dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the city's criminal justice system. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF GILFEMA'S ""LITTLE WING"")

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new district attorney. He's dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the city's criminal justice system and is a longtime advocate of criminal justice reform to address racial and economic inequities in the system.

His father is in prison. Both his parents, David Gilbert and Kathy Boudin, were radical leftists who were convicted for driving the getaway car in a 1981 botched armed robbery of a Brink's truck that resulted in the deaths of two police officers and a guard. Kathy Boudin was released on parole in 2003, the same year that Chesa Boudin became a Rhodes scholar. She is now the co-director and co-founder of the Columbia University Center for Justice. Chesa Boudin was raised by his parents' friends Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, who are former members of the radical leftist group the Weather Underground and became educators and education reformers.

There are so many children now who have parents who are incarcerated. What was the experience like for you, as a child, making so many visits to see your parents in prison, being searched before going in, seeing the conditions your parents were living in? Did it become a kind of normal thing for you? Or was it always upsetting to see that?

BOUDIN: In many ways, my experience was normal. It became normal to me the way it does to so many American families. Approximately 50% of adult Americans have an immediate family member who is either currently or formerly incarcerated. That's what mass incarceration means. Having a loved one behind bars has become a normal part for the majority of Americans at some point in their life.

And for me, as a kid, on the one hand, it was traumatic. It was anxiety-inducing. It set me back in school. It led to behavioral problems that are so common amongst children with incarcerated parents. And on the other hand, it did become normal. It became normal to go through metal detectors, to get patted down by guards, to have to go through steel gates every time I wanted to give my parents a hug. And I got to know and be friends with so many of the other children whose parents were in my parents' prisons over the years.

I saw firsthand most of the people in America's jails and prisons don't look like me. They're not white; they're black and brown. And I saw that most of those kids did not have the opportunities or the privileges that I had to grow up in a stable family, to get academic support from tutors, to see therapists as a child to help me overcome my anger and my shame and the stigma of parental incarceration. And in fact, many of those kids who I grew up with in the prison visiting room themselves ended up incarcerated.

And I also saw that, in many ways, as hard as my parents' incarceration has been and continues to be for me, as I live with the anxiety of my father being vulnerable to COVID-19, I was really lucky. There are three families that don't have a father anymore because of the crime that my parents participated in. Those families - from afar, I saw how they suffered, and I know that I will never be able to fully appreciate the loss that my parents' crime imposed.

GROSS: Did you ever meet those families?

BOUDIN: I have met some extended members of those families. We've been in contact indirectly through city leaders and clergy in their communities, and we've been in some email contact over the years. Yeah, I think for some of them, there's a recognition that, in a different way, I was also a victim of my parents' crime. I was left abandoned at the babysitter. I was innocent of any wrongdoing at 14 months old, and yet my life was turned upside down. I suffered a tremendous loss and destabilization and trauma that so many innocent children suffer when their parents commit crimes.

GROSS: It must've been kind of confusing for you as a kid to be raised in a stable family, to have a grandfather who was a famous civil liberties lawyer, but to be stigmatized by a lot of people who you grew up with because your parents were in prison. At the same time, when you'd visit your parents in prison, you felt very privileged by comparison. So you were kind of different in either world, in both of those worlds.

BOUDIN: I often felt like I had one foot shackled to the American prison system because of my parents' incarceration and another foot firmly rooted in the luxuries and privileges of the American dream - a stable family, a loving family, two older brothers I looked up to, a great school, sports teams, Model United Nations, chess club. And that reality continues to shape my life and my perspective.

I was in my father's prison visiting room earlier on the same day that I learned I'd won San Francisco's election to be district attorney. As long as my father's incarcerated and even beyond, even after he passes or even after he's released, I will always be shaped by, profoundly impacted by the experience of spending now nearly 40 years visiting prisons.

GROSS: Were you traumatized by that as a kid? Did you have nightmares about prison?

BOUDIN: I had nightmares, temper tantrums. I had anxiety attacks. I was set back in a variety of basic developmental markers. I stopped talking after my parents' arrest. I didn't fully learn to read until I was 9 years old. It required a tremendous amount of extra support and love just to get me back on track with my classmates. And that extra support and love, those resources are simply not available to most children with incarcerated parents. And frankly, they're not available to most crime victims, either.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is San Francisco's new DA, Chesa Boudin, who's part of the movement of progressive prosecutors working to reform the criminal justice system. We'll be back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, ""PEACOCKS"")

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new DA who's dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the city's criminal justice system. He's also active in the movement to reform the criminal justice system. His father, who is 75 now, is in prison in New York.

So it's interesting that you decided to become a prosecutor because, you know, your parents were in prison. Your adoptive parents, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn, they were members of the Weather Underground. And your father participated in bombings kind of some - intended to be, I think, symbolic bombings, but still bombings of buildings that were symbolic of the power that they were imposing. This was the era of the Vietnam War. So there's a bombing of the Pentagon, of the Capitol building, of a New York City police headquarters. So I - your father says they worked hard to make sure no one was injured. I'm not sure if anybody ever was injured during those bombings.

But still, like, your adoptive parents and your parents were people who intentionally broke the law for politically motivated reasons, reasons a lot of people would say that these are the wrong tactics to accomplish those goals. But still, you became a prosecutor. It would be hard to imagine - like, for me to imagine, anyways - your parents or your adoptive parents becoming prosecutors. So what led you into becoming a - into, you know, becoming a prosecutor?

BOUDIN: My earliest memories are going through steel gates and metal detectors just to give my parents a hug. My whole life has been shaped by the criminal justice system because of the mistakes that my parents made. And it's that life experience of seeing how broken our criminal justice system is that led me to go to law school, to become a public defender and, as a public defender, to see the ways in which our system is failing crime victims, is failing people accused of crime and is failing communities that are impacted by it.

It's because of that career and that life experience that I decided to be a prosecutor, to try to reimagine and reinvent the ways in which our law enforcement agencies help keep us safe and address the real harm that's caused by crime in our communities.

GROSS: I would imagine that you grew up with a lot of suspicion of police officers and people in the criminal justice system, of prosecutors because, again, your parents were behind bars, serving long sentences - a life sentence in your father's case - for their participation in a politically motivated robbery of a Brink's truck that led to three deaths. And your adoptive parents lived underground for a long time. They were members of the Weather Underground. And your father participated in acts of bombing in ways that he hoped wouldn't injure anybody.

So did you grow up very suspicious of people in law enforcement? And then there was also, of course, the FBI, who was spying on a lot of left-wing movements, including your father? Or including your adoptive father, including Bill Ayers, right?

BOUDIN: Right. And just to be clear, when you're talking about the bombings, you're talking about my adoptive father, not my biological father who was incarcerated.

GROSS: Yes.

BOUDIN: And, again, you know, I've been really clear today and throughout my life that I don't endorse or support many of the choices my parents made. I condemn the use of violence as a tool for social change. And I think that it's - you know, it's important to judge their actions in the context of history. In the 1970s - the '60s and '70s, there were thousands of bombings across the country, most of which were not in any way connected to my adoptive parents or their groups. It was a very different period than the one that I've lived through.

And today, as in the 1960s and '70s, there are communities that do not perceive the police or law enforcement, generally, as a force for good in their neighborhoods, and that's something that I'm working hard to change. We have a lot of people, particularly people of color, who perceive the presence of police in their neighborhoods and their communities as a force for oppression, as something that holds people down, as something that targets for harassment and racial discrimination. And we know that there's racism at every single step of the criminal justice system.

So yes, I was aware of the ways in which criminal justice actors, including police, perpetuate and exacerbate racial disparities in our society. And it's one of the things that I ran my campaign on, is finding ways to reduce those racial disparities, finding ways to rebuild the trust between law enforcement and the communities that we've sworn to serve and protect.

GROSS: Your parents found ways in prison to do good work. Your mother started an education and literacy program in prison, and your father, I think, started a program for prisoners with AIDS. I think your mother started, also, a program for incarcerated mothers. Was that encouraging to you to think that even in prison you could find a way to be helpful and productive and that your parents managed to find ways of doing that?

BOUDIN: Absolutely. Both of my parents were really active within prison and finding ways to give back and be supportive of their communities. My father pioneered a prisoner education program for people with AIDS, and that was at a time when the HIV-AIDS epidemic was really threatening stability, not just lives but also the stability of prison life because people were so scared and, as today with COVID-19, forced to live in close proximity to each other with very limited access to health care and very limited information about how the disease was spread.

And my father's work in that area in the late 1980s and early 1990s not only saved lives but also became a model for other prisons across the state and across the country. My father's also been a peer educator in anti-violence trainings, working with other inmates to learn techniques for de-escalating tense situations to prevent violence. You know, my father's been remorseful. He's been repentant. He has been rehabilitated.

GROSS: Your mother got out of prison in 2003 on parole, and it was just about at the same time that you became a Rhodes scholar. So I think within two weeks, she got out of prison and then you went to Oxford to pursue your work as a Rhodes scholar. What were those two weeks like for you?

BOUDIN: It was a pretty emotionally intense period. I was actually on a visit in my father's prison when I got the news that my mother had been physically released. We knew she'd been granted parole, but we didn't know the exact date. And I wanted to visit my father one last time before heading off to Oxford. And so I was with him in the moment when my mother was released. I left immediately my father's prison and went back to New York City where my mother had been paroled to.

And I remember when she met me at the airport. And it was a pretty powerful moment for me, for us to see her wearing something other than her prison green uniform, to be able to hug her and not have anyone tell us that we should stop hugging, to be able to walk down the street with her and share so many of the little details that make up daily life in a way that I'd never ever been able to do with her in my living memory.

GROSS: She is now the co-director and co-founder of the Center for Justice at Columbia University. So she managed to carve out a very good and productive, meaningful place for herself. Were you surprised that she would able to do that after spending so many years in prison?

BOUDIN: The transition back to the community after incarceration is always challenging, and it was challenging for my mother. But I never had a doubt in my mind about her ability to succeed. She's a hard worker. She's someone rooted in community, ambitious and optimistic and deeply committed to the people in her community and around her.

So when she came home, she immediately started doing work in a public hospital, helping people with HIV/AIDS and other similar diseases. She also simultaneously earned her doctoral degree from Columbia University. Then she, I think, completed her dissertation within just a few years of her release. She's someone who, despite the mistakes she's made, has always been an inspiration to me because of her work ethic and her profound commitment to humanity.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is San Francisco's new DA Chesa Boudin. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Chesa Boudin, San Francisco's new DA who's dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on the city's criminal justice system.

During the years when both of your parents were incarcerated and in separate prisons and they couldn't communicate, were you kind of the go-between? Did they give you messages? Did your father give you messages for your mother and vice versa to relay?

BOUDIN: Yeah. My parents did sometimes communicate through me, send love to each other through me. And when I'd be visiting one of my parents, we'd often coordinate in advance to look at the sun or look at the sky together. And as a kid, my parents would tell me and remind me that even though we couldn't be together, we were all looking at the same sun or all looking at the same sky.

GROSS: That's very sweet to look at it together at the same time but separate.

BOUDIN: My parents found countless creative ways to parent, even from the distance that incarceration created. On phone calls, they would tell me adventure stories. And they would plan the stories, the plotline of those stories in advance with each other through prison mail. And then they would alternate telling one chapter of the story at a time to me on the phone calls that we could have one-on-one but not as a group.

GROSS: What were the stories about?

BOUDIN: All different kinds of adventures - boating down the Amazon River, traveling through Africa, you know, the kinds of things that any parents would tell adventure stories to their kids about - having superpowers, flying, you know, through the sky, playing with dinosaurs. All different things - but the themes, as you'd expect with children's adventure stories, tended to revolve around me being a superhero of some kind and, of course, our family being together.

GROSS: Did you enjoy the stories?

BOUDIN: Oh, I loved them. I looked forward to those calls. I couldn't wait for the next call from the next parent to tell me the next chapter.

GROSS: I didn't know this until we started talking today - after we'd set up the interview and after I had prepared - but your father has applied for clemency. So what grounds is he asking for clemency on, and is it connected at all to COVID-19?

BOUDIN: It is related to COVID-19, Terry. My father and a number of other older, medically vulnerable inmates have applied for clemency. And I'm aware of efforts within New York state to review those clemency applications for the people who are most at risk of dying because of COVID-19. I think it's appropriate and wise for Governor Cuomo to look closely at people who are vulnerable. He's doing a phenomenal job leading New York - and in many ways the country - through this crisis. And we cannot succeed in our fight against COVID-19 if we forget about people who are incarcerated.

We've talked on this show today at length about the ways in which people who are incarcerated are uniquely vulnerable. My father is one of those people, and I hope that my father and others like him will be released for their safety as well as the safety of their families and everyone working in jails and prisons.

GROSS: This might be too personal, but if your father succeeds in getting clemency and is released, do you think that he and your mother would resume their marriage? They haven't been together in so long. I don't know how often she visits him, if at all. I don't know if they still consider themselves to be partners.

BOUDIN: They have a very close relationship, but it was obviously damaged by the decades that they both spent in prison, the decades that my father has spent in prison since her release. They weren't really allowed to have any meaningful contact during the more than 20 years my mother spent in prison. And it was an amazing experience for me to go visit my father with my mother when she was first allowed to visit him, years after her release. I don't know what would happen in terms of their relationship if they're released - if my father were to be released.

But I know that my mother and I are dedicated to supporting my father, that we love him very much and that we would support him in his transition back to the community, if he were granted clemency.

GROSS: Chesa Boudin, I want to thank you so much. And I wish you well. I wish your father well.

BOUDIN: Thank you, Terry. It's a pleasure. Always happy to talk with you. Hope we can do it again soon. And hope you all are staying safe out there.

GROSS: Chesa Boudin is San Francisco's DA.

Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll remember songwriter and singer John Prine, who died Tuesday of COVID-19. He was 73. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in June. We'll listen back to the interview we recorded in 2018. I hope you'll join us.

We're closing today's show with music produced by Hal Willner. He died yesterday at the age of 64. His symptoms were consistent with COVID-19, but he was not officially diagnosed. What we're hearing now is pianist Jaki Byard playing the theme from the Fellini film ""Amarcord,"" a track from Willner's tribute album to Nino Rota, who wrote music for several Fellini films.

(SOUNDBITE OF JAKI BYARD'S ""AMARCORD"")

GROSS: Willner was a longtime music supervisor on ""Saturday Night Live,"" produced albums by Lou Reed, Marianne Faithfull, Lucinda Williams, Bill Frisell and others and curated great tribute albums for which he got musicians and singers he loved to record the music of composers and genres he loved. In addition to the Rota tribute album, Willner recorded albums paying tribute to Thelonious Monk, Kurt Weill, Disney films and sea chanteys. Over the years, we've often played music from his tribute albums at the end of our show or between segments.

Here's one more track that Hal Willner was responsible for. This is Lou Reed singing ""September Song"" from Willner's album ""Lost In The Stars,"" featuring songs by Kurt Weill.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SEPTEMBER SONG"")

LOU REED: (Singing) When I was a young man courting the girls, I played me a waiting game. If a maid refused me with tossing curls, oh, I'd let that old earth take a couple of whirls, while I plied her with tears in place of pearls. And as time came around, she came my way. As time came around, she came. For it's a long, long while from May to December. And the days grow short when you reach September. And I have lost my teeth, and I'm walking a little lame. Hey, honey, I haven't got the time for any waiting game. And the days turn to gold as they grow few. September, November and these few golden days, I'd like to spend them with you. These golden days, I'd like to spend them with you.

GROSS: FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden, Mooj Zadie, Thea Chaloner and Seth Kelley. Our associate producer of digital media is Molly Seavy-Nesper. Our technical director and engineer is Audrey Bentham. Roberta Shorrock directs the show. I'm Terry Gross.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SEPTEMBER SONG"")

REED: (Singing) And the days dwindle down to a precious few - September, November. And I'm not quite equipped for these waiting games. I have a little money, and I've had a little pain. And these few golden days, as they grow so few, these golden days...

A South Korean contract construction worker working at the U.S. military garrison Camp Walker in Daegu — the South Korean city hardest hit by the the coronavirus outbreak — on Monday became the eighth person linked to the U.S. military in that nation to be diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

""The problem that we found with case number 8 is that he's been sick since last Monday, March 2, and he's been coming through our gates answering our questions falsely,"" said garrison commander Col. Edward Ballanco in a Facebook Live video of the construction worker, who was found to have tested positive last week for Covid-19. ""It's reprehensible, and he will never be coming on post again.""

A U.S. soldier and his wife stationed in South Korea have also tested positive for coronavirus.

All of the approximately 18,000 U.S. Army personnel, both uniformed and civilian, and their families stationed on bases in South Korea received orders Sunday to ""stop movement."" All travel to or from South Korea for those affected is being halted by the order at least until May 6.

The U.S. forces in South Korea have been on high alert for the coronavirus since Feb. 24. There have been more than 7,700 confirmed cases in South Korea.

In Italy, where more than 10,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed — the highest number of cases outside China — a similar ""stop movement"" order was imposed on the more than 4,000 U.S. Army troops and civilians stationed there at three U.S. bases.

Last week a sailor stationed in Naples became the first — and to date, only — member of the U.S. military to test positive for the coronavirus in Italy.

Nearly a quarter-million uniformed and civilian Americans are stationed with the U.S. military in 176 nations, according to the latest Pentagon report, and another 2.7 million work at military installations across the United States.

Many work at or nearby the Pentagon, located in Washington, D.C.

""We're fully confident that we can continue to perform the functions that the Pentagon needs to perform if we have some type of outbreak in the building,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon last Thursday. ""We don't have that yet — knock wood — but we want to be prepared for everything and we're taking a variety of measures.""",real

This is just an outright lie.

These government clowns are making it harder and harder for the average American to trust them.

DISRN reported:

Washington epidemiologists have admitted that multiple victims of gunshot wounds who had also been diagnosed with coronavirus have been counted as COVID-19 deaths, although they say deaths from the virus are still likely being undercounted in the state. Epidemiologists with the Washington State Department of Health said that the “number of nuances” in coronavirus data makes it difficult to render a quick assessment in the cause of death. The state is currently counting anyone that dies with COVID-19 in its death toll. “We currently do have some deaths that are being reported that are clearly from other causes. We have about 5 deaths less than 5 deaths that we know of that are related to obvious other causes. In this case, they are from gunshot wounds,” said Dr. Katie Hutchison, Health Statistics Manager for the Washington State Department of Health. The state is currently reviewing between 20 and 30 similar cases to understand what role — if any — coronavirus played in the deaths, Hutchison said, adding the process will take between six and 12 months.

""With the virus continuing to impact communities and ports around the globe, we have made the decision to further suspend cruise voyages across our fleet for all sailings embarking through July 31, 2020,"" Christine Da Silva, spokesperson for Norwegian, told USA TODAY in an email.

The suspension was previoulsy extended to last through the end of June after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed a 100-day no-sail order following outbreaks on ships belonging to multiple cruise lines.

Passengers on three Norwegian ships had symptoms or tested positive after their sailings, the CDC said.

The no-sail order – which was imposed April 15 – required cruise lines to cancel sailings through July 24. Last week, Disney Cruise Line suspended its sailings past the July 24 expiration date until July 27 and Carnival Cruise Line had previously extended its sailing suspension until Aug. 1.

""Despite this further delay, we remain optimistic and expect to relaunch cruise operations in the near future,"" Da Silva said. ""Given the fluid and evolving nature of the circumstances, we are making decisions as quickly and thoughtfully as possible and, as always, we are keeping our guests’ and travel partners’ best interests at heart.""

'Hygiene is the new luxury':How cruise ship design could evolve to ward against outbreaks

Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said during an earnings call Thursday that Norwegian has been planning a phased relaunch.

Last week, he estimated full resumption of operations could take up to six months across Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' 28 ships, which are spread across its three brands: flagship Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.

But he expressed that it will take time and require cooperation with government and health authorities – including the CDC.

Del Rio said wants to do ""everything humanly possible within the bounds of what technology offers today"" to be able to look his family members in the eyes and tell them that Norwegian's cruise ships are safe to board.

Del Rio added that ships won't operate until that point, and when operations start to resume, it will be a gradual process that takes several months.

""Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,"" Del Rio said.

Passengers who had made a reservation on one of Norwegian Cruise Line's canceled sailings will receive a 125% or 150% future cruise credit, depending on the date of their trip. They can either use that credit through the end of 2022 or opt for a full refund, according to its website.

Sayer Ji reports on a new NPR investigation which reveals that despite $660 million in federal spending to set up 30+ field hospitals for the anticipated catastrophic case load from COVID-19, most of the emergency field hospitals had ZERO patients.

The implications of this NPR report are profound, revealing that the dominant mainstream narrative about COVID-19's catastrophic burden on the US healthcare system never materialized. As reported on May 7th, 2020,

""As hospitals were overrun by coronavirus patients in other parts of the world, the Army Corps of Engineers mobilized in the U.S., hiring private contractors to build emergency field hospitals around the country. The endeavor cost more than $660 million, according to an NPR analysis of federal spending records. But nearly four months into the pandemic, most of these facilities haven't treated a single patient.""

The statistics reveal a striking contrast between the official narrative of hospitals overrun with patients and bodies piling up and the reality of how overblown the crisis was from the beginning.

Updated at 11:31 p.m. ET

The Tony Award-winning American playwright Terrence McNally has died of complications related to COVID-19. He died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. at age 81. McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

His work on Kiss of the Spider Woman, Love! Valor! Compassion!, Master Class and Ragtime won him a string of Tonys in the 1990s. He also won a lifetime achievement Tony last year. In all, McNally's body of work encompassed some four dozen plays and musicals, many of which went to Broadway.

McNally was born Nov. 3, 1938 in St. Petersburg, Fla., and grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas, before attending Columbia University in New York. (In a 2002 interview with the school, he professed not to know how he had graduated, saying: ""I went to the theater so much."")

McNally was a crucial voice in illuminating the lives of LGBT people in the United States; in 1995, the New York Times marveled that his ""proudly gay play"" Love! Valor! Compassion! became a mainstream Broadway hit.

In a 2019 interview, he told Playbill he was ""tone-deaf,"" but that he also considered himself to be a musical person. Certainly, much of his stage work — whether writing books for musicals or, in the case of Master Class, creating a theatrical portrait of opera legend Maria Callas — was an expression of his deep love of music. He also wrote the librettos for two operas by composer Jake Heggie: Great Scott and Dead Man Walking.

In a 2003 interview with WHYY's Fresh Air, composer John Kander — who, alongside lyricist Fred Ebb, collaborated with McNally on several shows, including Kiss of the Spider Woman — called him a gracious co-creator. ""[McNally] is very good at writing a scene that has five pages in it that he knows perfectly well we're going to steal and musicalize,"" Kander said, ""but where he will let a character go on in dialogue in a way which is probably unnatural for him emotionally to do. And he does that in order to turn Fred and me on to musicalizing it.""

Among his other awards were an Emmy, two Guggenheim Fellowships, four Drama Desk Awards, two Obies and an induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.",real

According to radio station Cadena Cope, La Liga’s administrators have ruled out a comeback on the 12th of June, the initial date that was earmarked for the resumption of play, due to health and safety fears.

Players in Spain have been gradually easing their way back into training on an individual basis and were scheduled to link up with their teammates for group sessions next week.

The differences between the autonomous region’s stances on the Coronavirus lockdown, akin to the clashes between Westminster and the devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in the UK, have however caused a delay, as some areas have been out of complete lockdown for longer than others.

Speaking to the Spanish press; LaLiga President Javier Tebas expressed optimism that the 2019-20 season, will be able to be concluded on the pitch.

“Clubs, directors, players and referees are all keen to start the season again but the competition will only start when the health authorities consider it to be possible. Coordination with CSD (Spanish Sports Council) and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) will be key.” – Tebas stated.

English Premier League clubs have also tentatively commenced group training sessions, ahead of their own potential kick off in June.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp; whose side sit top of the division, yesterday outlined his desire to get back in action.

“I woke up even earlier than usual and then I realised it was my first day, It felt like the first day at school - for me, it was 46 years ago, but it must have been similar. I dressed myself in my uniform again - and for the right reason, for going to training.” – Klopp told Liverpool’s official website.

Other leading figures have however been critical of the decision to encourage teams to return to training.

Pundit and former Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp believed that the potential withdrawal of players from squads for personal reasons, could lead to an unfair competition, with some teams boasting much stronger starting elevens.

""I've spoken to managers, there's a lot more to come out that just don't feel right about it, that’s going to be a major problem. If you've got a squad of 22, 23 players and six or seven are not comfortable, they think they're putting their families at risk, how is that a fair competition? It becomes a real Premier League problem. It doesn't become fair.” – Redknapp said to Sky Sports.

Premier League teams have been at odds over the so-called “Project Restart”, despite voting in favour of resuming full contact training next week.

Questions still remain about the provision of personal protective equipment, transit to and from stadiums, and the potential use of neutral venues.

If the sides cannot iron out their differences before the start of June; then only a few viable ways to conclude the season remain.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.",fake

Representatives for three pot shops in the city confirmed that sales have spiked as the coronavirus spread across the state in recent weeks. Meanwhile, a similar trend has played out in other states that have legalized weed.

Kris Krane, president of 4Front Ventures, a multi-state pot firm that operates the Mission dispensary in South Chicago, said Wednesday that “sales have been up everywhere.” Krane said daily sales at some of the company’s medical stores in other states had even eclipsed those of April 20, an unofficial weed holiday that typically serves as “the highest volume sales day of the year.”

Krane said sales at the Chicago dispensary peaked on Monday before dipping slightly the following day when state regulators announced new guidelines for weed stores. To comply with those new rules and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mission started limiting the number of people allowed inside at once and reduced how many registers employees can operate.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some Chicago shops have suspended recreational weed sales in order to prioritize medical patients. What’s more, GreenGate Chicago, a medical-only store in Rogers Park, announced Wednesday it was closing for two weeks, while The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side shut down Thursday for cleaning.

Before closing their doors to recreational customers on Monday, Dispensary 33 in Uptown also saw sales jump.

“There was a bit of a spike,” said Dispensary 33 owner Bryan Zises. “We’re seeing people worried about having to leave their house and wanting to buy more than they generally would. Everyone is concerned. Everyone is just fearful.”

In terms of medical sales, Zises said a smaller number of patients are now buying more weed than they usually would. Zises noted that those folks are concerned about the state’s marijuana supply chain, which has been strained since recreational sales came online at the start of the year.

Jason Erkes, spokesman for Loop-based Cresco Labs, said the company’s store in Lake View has seen an uptick in customers in recent weeks — though it’s unclear whether the limited options have simply pushed more people to the few shops that are still selling recreational pot.

“It’s hard to gauge if we’re just picking up the people that would’ve shopped there or if they’re new people,” said Erkes

“We definitely have more customers, but we really don’t know where they’re coming from. That doesn’t necessarily mean more people are buying cannabis.”",real

Editor, Health Impact News

Earlier this week (April, 2020), U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, appeared at the White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference to explain why the country is facing some food shortages, such as meats, in grocery stores, even though there is plenty of food in the country.

The problem is the commodity-based food distribution system, which is experiencing bottle necks right now due to restaurants and other food establishments being shut down across the country due to the coronavirus restrictions.

A significant portion of commodity-based food sales is processed, packaged, and distributed for businesses, and not for consumers who purchase food in stores and supermarkets.

So with the decline in food sales to businesses, there has also been a corresponding demand for food in grocery stores from consumers who would normally be eating more at restaurants, schools, ball parks, and work places.

Lisa Held, writing for Civil Eats, highlighted the problem in an article published earlier this week:

“It’s like Armageddon, but we’ll get through it,” Benjamin Walker explained over the phone in mid-March. That day, sales at Baldor—the New York-based food distribution company where Walker is the vice president of sales and marketing—had dropped by 85 percent. With 90 percent of its business focused on food service, Baldor’s 400 trucks are typically loaded with specialty produce, meats, and baked goods bound for restaurants, hotels, schools, and stadiums in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. In other words, its food goes to all of the institutions that have been shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. “The shimmer of hope for us is the 10 percent of retail [sales we were already doing],” Walker said. “That’s really the only food channel operating at the moment, and that supply chain has been maxed out.” Over the last months, Walker and his team have been acting quickly to onboard new accounts and reroute those trucks. As shoppers across the country have stockpiled food in anticipation of weeks or months of eating at home, there has been significant panic at the sight of empty shelves in grocery stores. Experts and food-industry groups have jumped in to assure the public, in various publications, that the American food supply was strong and those shelves do not reflect shortages. Instead, they were said to be a reflection of behind-the-scenes adjustments that need to be made by manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to keep up with where people are eating. (Full article here.)

There are a lot of businesses that get a piece of the pie that is our food system here in the U.S., controlling the flow of food from the farm to the consumer.

When everything is going well, it is like a high-speed train going from one destination to another. And most of the food you see in your grocery store, or eat at institutions, is heavily subsidized by taxpayers as well, keeping food cheap, and not representing the true cost to produce that food.

But when a crisis hits the nation, such as the current coronavirus pandemic, it just takes one section of the train to derail and cause the entire system to start failing, and potentially to completely derail.

And the effects we are seeing today as a result of the nationwide lock downs, are really a small problem in the grand scheme of things when it comes to food distribution in this country.

Just think of what the effects could potentially look like if, for example, transportation was disrupted due to energy disruptions, or communication was disrupted due to electrical grid issues, or telecommunication issues.

This is mild in comparison to what might happen, for example, if the country found itself in a real war, and not a “war” on a virus, where an enemy could bring down the power grid, disrupt the Internet, etc.

This should be a wake up call that our nation’s food distribution system is incredibly vulnerable.

The Food Freedom Movement

Back in 2011, some small communities in the state of Maine began what many today call the “Food Freedom” movement, where local municipalities passed “Food Sovereignty” laws, seeking to bypass State and Federal regulations to allow farmers to sell their products directly to consumers in their community, cutting out all the “middlemen” in the food distribution system within their local communities. See:

Such arrangements are win-win situations for consumers and farmers in their communities. Farmers are able to charge a higher price, usually for a better quality product as well, and it keeps costs down for the consumer by bypassing all the middlemen in the process.

The consumer still usually pays a higher price than the commodity products in grocery stores, because government subsidies are generally not available for such farm-to-consumer sales, but the consumer gets a far better quality product, and develops a relationship in their community with the producers of the food, where accountability is much more transparent, in contrast to commodity food purchased in most grocery stores where the consumer has no idea where the food came from, or even which country it may have come from.

As can be expected, there was strong push back from state and federal regulators, and these local laws in Maine went through many court battles.

But lawmakers realized that this was a popular concept with the citizens of their state, and so state-wide bills were proposed, and in 2017, the governor of Maine signed “the Maine Food Sovereignty Act.”

There are still many hurdles and challenges to open up direct farm to consumer sales in the U.S., but Wyoming has been recognized as one of the best examples today of a Food Freedom law, and if the commodity-based food system does fail, either in the short-term future, or in the future under a more severe national crisis, residents of Wyoming might be in the best position to still obtain food from producers in their state.

Baylen Linnekin, writing for Reason Magazine, recently highlighted the advantages of Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act, especially in light of potential meat shortages now facing the nation’s commodity food system.

Wyoming’s first-and-best-in-the-nation food freedom law just keeps getting better. Wyoming’s groundbreaking Food Freedom Act has served as a national model for how states can deregulate many in-state food sales. The five-year-old law opened up many previously illegal food transactions in Wyoming, and has delivered on its promise to benefit ranchers, other food entrepreneurs, and consumers alike. And it’s done so without a single case of foodborne illness being tied to any foods sold under the law. The law also keeps getting better. As I detailed a column just last month, an amendment to the Act will allow low-risk foods such as homemade jams to be sold in grocery stores and sold and consumed in restaurants. That was great news. But yet another new amendment to the law, passed last month and set to take effect in July, could further bolster the fortunes of ranchers and consumers in the state. A new animal share amendment will let consumers buy individual cuts of meat directly from ranchers though an animal-share agreement, completely outside of the typical U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection regime. That’s something that’s still illegal in the other 49 states. It’s also why the Wyoming law could be a game changer for ranchers in the state and—should other states follow suit—a valuable new revenue stream for farmers and ranchers across the country. The new amendment was introduced by Wyoming State Rep. Tyler Lindholm (R), who co-sponsored the bipartisan Food Freedom Act five years ago. “The idea for the bill is simple,” Lindholm—a rancher with whom I serve on the board of the nonprofit Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund—told me this week. “Let ranchers and farmers sell herd shares for their animals. That way the entire herd is ‘owned’ by all of the customers before slaughter, thereby meeting the exemption standards of the federal law, and now the rancher does not have to jump through the hoops of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and can utilize the smaller mom and pop butchers that still [exist] in most of our small towns.” The premise behind animal shares isn’t new. For example, some states which prohibit raw (unpasteurized) milk sales allow distribution to people who’ve purchased shares in one or more of a farmer’s dairy cattle. These “herdshare” agreements let a farmer raise and care for the herd-shared livestock in exchange for providing some of its (typically unpasteurized) milk to share owners. Meat sharing has been a bit more complicated. As I detail in my book, Biting the Hands that Feed Us: How Fewer, Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable, a consumer may buy a significant portion of a living cow—say one-quarter or one-half its post-slaughter weight—and take possession of its meat after it’s been slaughtered in a non-USDA approved facility without running afoul of USDA rules. But that can mean buying more than 100-200 pounds of beef. Until the new Wyoming law, consumers who weren’t quite that hungry (or who wanted only a particular cut of meat) have had little option but to buy from farmers who’d had their animals processed under the USDA’s rules or to go to the grocery store for similarly inspected cuts. The Wyoming amendment takes advantage of an exemption created under § 623(a) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, which governs interstate and even most intrastate livestock slaughter and meat sales in this country. The FMIA exemption allows custom slaughtering of livestock by and for an “owner” of the animal. (Read the full article at Reason.com)

Time to Invest in Our Local Farmers: The Herd Share Economic Model

My company, Healthy Traditions, has been selling grass-fed meats and pastured poultry and eggs online for more than a decade. We source these products from small-scale family farms, many of them Amish farms in western Wisconsin.

But we have never considered ourselves as a replacement for consumers to purchase these kinds of products directly from producers in their own communities. Direct sales from farm to consumer is always the best option, if it is available.

For one thing, the consumer can find similar, high-quality products such as we sell, at a much more affordable price than purchasing it from our online ecommerce business, by cutting out the middlemen, in this case us. We have to pay the farmers a fair price for their products, the products have to be stored in freezers, shipped with special packaging and dry ice, etc. – all middleman services that increase the price.

In addition to these additional costs, our meats have to be processed in USDA certified processing plants to meet federal laws to sell food between states. There have been some seasons where we have had little to no chickens for sale, for example, because small-scale poultry processing plants that meet the standards for USDA inspectors are very few, and many go out of business after only a few years of trying to make it.

And because these products are not subsidized, typically only the upper middle class and wealthier consumers can afford them.

And with the current lock downs, more people are purchasing online, putting strains on our inventory as well.

The “herd share” or “animal share” model defined by Baylen Linnekin above, is a far better economic model, if we want to be serious about food security in this country. This model has served well in many parts of the country, because the farmer is not selling retail, and is not participating in the commodity food distribution system at all.

By allowing their neighbors and fellow state citizens to invest in their farm, by purchasing shares in their operation which gives them ownership of part of their livestock, they are producing a legal, contractual relationship with members of their community, which should bypass the many regulations that are designed only for the commodity food distribution model.

Courts around the country have a mixed-bag record of upholding these contractual rights, so maybe it is time to pass federal laws protecting such contracts?

Do you have a herd share operation? Are you a farmer who is interested in starting a herd share operation for members of your community and state?

If so, you can contact us at HealthyTraditions.com. Put “Herdshare” in the subject of your email, and if there is enough interest, we will create a directory of herdshare programs around the U.S. so consumers have choices once the commodity-based food system fails.

The current U.S. food distribution system might survive the coronavirus crisis, but it would not take much to bring it to a screeching halt, sadly.

Set to enter her junior year at the University of California, Davis, where she is earning a double major in community and regional development and Spanish, Larman returned to her parents’ home in nearby Albany, Calif., in mid-March, when Gavin Newsom became the nation’s first governor to issue shelter-in-place restrictions that put an end to in-person instruction.

Larman and nearly 40,000 of her classmates continued their education on Zoom, an online platform few had ever heard of before and that teachers and students alike have found to be a disorienting, two-dimensional substitute.

“I feel like I’m definitely not learning as much in my classes and I’m not having a very good time,” Larman told Yahoo News. “I really thrive off of being on campus. Seeing all of my friends in my classes really keeps me engaged. I like going to the coffee shop on campus and walking around. I like that routine.”

While Larman says that “the school did a really good job considering the crazy circumstances,” Zoom instruction isn’t what she bargained for, and she’s considering taking a leave of absence rather than return for another quarter of online offerings.

“I’m not sure if it’s worth around $5,000 a quarter [the cost of tuition only, excluding room and board] to attend a Zoom university,” Larman said.

She’s not alone. Dozens of students and their parents have filed lawsuits against colleges and universities this spring seeking tuition reimbursement. But the question of value is even more pressing looking ahead. Last week, California State University announced it would hold most of its classes next year online thanks to the coronavirus. That means 500,000 students will have to decide, in Larman’s words, whether “to attend a Zoom university.” If polling on this question is accurate, that could prove ruinous for higher education. A recent survey conducted by the American Council on Education found that nearly 20 percent of students currently enrolled in college are either unsure they will continue in the fall or say they will definitely not do so.

And the academic disruption caused by the pandemic has sparked a debate about the future of higher education in America.

“Nobody knows what the retention rates are going to be in the fall,” Roblin Meeks, associate dean of graduate studies at Manhattan’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told Yahoo News. “I think everybody is in a holding pattern. If Congress appropriates money for the states, then it won’t be as bad. It’s hard to know how much money the campuses are going to have to work with.”

John Jay, with 13,000 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students, is part of the City University of New York, which receives approximately 60 percent of its funding from the state.

“There’s no school in the CUNY system that has a large endowment,” Meeks said. “Everyone is tuition-driven, so if a bunch of your students don’t show up, that’s really bad.”

It’s unclear when restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which hit New York harder than any other city in the world, will be lifted. While the president of the well-endowed Ivy League Brown University, Christina Paxson, foresees implementing rigorous coronavirus testing, contact-tracing cellphone apps and new social distancing policies in order to lure students back to campus, for colleges in the CUNY system like John Jay, making that transition is harder to envision.",real
790,677,https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-divide-hurts-lower-income-students-during-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-07,3 charts show the alarming ways school closures have left America's most vulnerable children behind,"The novel coronavirus has forced many schools to close, meaning students have needed to adapt quickly to remote learning.

However, this has caused challenges for students who don't have a computer or WiFi at home to keep up with schoolwork.

A recent survey from Pew Research Center found the percentage of children who likely cannot complete their schoolwork during coronavirus school closures varies by their parents' income.

More than a third of lower-income parents believe it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to finish their schoolwork because they don't have a computer at home.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The novel coronavirus outbreak has required children to quickly adjust to remote courses as schools closed to help mitigate the spread of the virus. However, remote learning has caused challenges for students who don't have internet access or a computer at home.

Per figures from the Department of Commerce, 14%, or 7 million, children between 6-17 years old lived in households without internet access in 2017.

That digital divide varies by region. Many cities in Alabama, Texas, and New Mexico have large shares of households without an internet subscription or a computer, based on US Census data.

The ""homework gap"" between students who lack the proper resources to complete their work and those who have these resources has been exacerbated during the coronavirus, based on new survey results from Pew Research Center.

The new Pew poll surveyed 4,917 US adults from April 7-12 about their children's ability to complete schoolwork from home.

According to the results, 22% of parents reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will have to use public WiFi during remote learning because they don't have reliable internet in their households. 21% also reported it is somewhat or very likely their children will not be able to complete their schoolwork at all because they do not have a computer.

Illustrating the ""digital divide"" between higher- and lower-income families, the results vary when separated by the respondent's income level. Lower-income parents reported higher shares of their children likely having to complete their schoolwork on a cellphone, through public WiFi, or not being able to complete their work at all compared to middle- and upper-income families.

Schools, internet providers, and states have all tried to help students get the proper resources to move to remote learning, but it has not been easy. In California, Google recently set up 100,000 broadband access points and plan to give thousands of students Chromebooks to help those in need. Even though Spectrum internet is giving 60 days of free internet access to families, people who have unpaid bills or already have an account cannot redeem this deal.

Some schools have reportedly tried other methods to ensure students can still complete schoolwork, such as people delivering schoolwork on paper to homes or using buses with WiFi signals.

Pew's survey results also indicate that 37% of Americans believe schools should be giving out computers to students during the outbreak. However, this opinion is divided along political lines. 45% of Democrats believe computers should be given to all students from the school, 17 percentage points higher than Republicans.

The partisan divide is smaller when focusing on students most in need. The difference between political parties is minimal for those who believe only students who cannot afford a computer should be given one during coronavirus, with 44% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans supporting this option.

The following three charts highlight the difficulty of completing schoolwork for children amid the coronavirus based on Pew survey respondents' income. The income levels used by Pew Research Center are based on 2018 earning figures where ""middle income is defined here as two-thirds to double the median annual income for all [Pew] panelists. Lower income falls below that range; upper income falls above it.""",real

There is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.

Per the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.

Immediate Relief Funding

Recognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.

Eligibility for Immediate Relief Payments

Per guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group’s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

In order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, “Care does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.”

The immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.

Payment Distributions

Payment distributions will be based on the provider’s or practice’s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments – which can be obtained from their organization’s revenue management system – by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.

Receiving Payments

In partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with “HHSPAYMENT” as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.

Providers must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.

Different Types of Providers

All relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer’s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.

The Remaining $70 Billion

As part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.

COVID-19 Medical Expenses

The federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from “balance billing” any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.

In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member’s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers – such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system – to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.

Heavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding.

815,1065,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-abbott-laboratories-coronavirus-test-accuracy/,2020-05-15,"FDA ""digging into"" data suggesting Abbott coronavirus test inaccuracies, but still recommends use, commissioner says","The Food and Drug Administration is ""digging into"" data that says a popular coronavirus test may give inaccurate results, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives — meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.

""What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,"" Hahn said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday. ""That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.""

Hahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general ""would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.""

""We've known that for years,"" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test ""were very robust.""

The purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.

""So for example, if a person you suspect — a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,"" he said.

Hahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as ""ultra-fast"" and ""very accurate.""

Abbott said while some studies have shown the ""sensitivity performance percentages,"" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.

""We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,"" the statement said. ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

The company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue ""to optimize"" the test.

Hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.

""We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,"" he said. ""We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.""

He said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an ""unprecedented demand for the tests.""

Hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, ""there are unique circumstances in the states.""

""The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,"" he said.",real

What’s the explanation here? “New CDC Coronavirus Data Cuts American Death Toll Nearly In HALF” https://t.co/CyyDpI8Fll — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) May 3, 2020

At this point, you can see the “edit” in the description of the linked article, an amendment added after the fact to acknowledge, to as small a degree as possible, that the premise of the article was entirely wrong. That was obvious in the moment, as The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake made clear.





What the article was insinuating was that the running total of covid-19 deaths compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was far smaller than what the media was reporting. At the time, the CDC listed about 37,000 deaths; media outlets were reporting something closer to 66,000. This was presented as the CDC having “cut” its estimate of the number of deaths from the virus — perhaps an acknowledgment that things weren’t as bad as they seemed.

But, again, this was nonsense.

Each day, the CDC publishes the number of deaths in a given week from covid-19. Many states and third-party aggregations of virus death tolls report the number of newly discovered deaths each day. If a hospital learns that a death the prior Thursday was a function of the virus, that death is included in the count for today, Tuesday. That’s not how the CDC does it. Instead, the CDC uses official confirmation of deaths from death certificates and ascribes deaths to the days on which they occur, meaning that Thursday’s death would be attributed to Thursday, even if we learned about it on Tuesday.





See where this is going? That means that last week’s numbers will go up more this week — and that the CDC’s numbers aren’t offered in real time. Comparing its total with compiled state reports’ total, in other words, is apples to oranges.

Now, two weeks after Ingraham’s elevation of this obviously wrong theory, we can show how wrong it was.

The article she linked to noted the disparity between the two lines below. The media was saying 66,000 deaths, but the CDC was under 40,000.

That total for the CDC used the department’s May 1 estimate. It releases a new estimate every weekday and, in each subsequent estimate, the numbers for the deaths in preceding weeks have increased as new deaths were reported to the federal government. Put visually, here’s how the CDC’s weekly estimate of deaths has increased over time.

It’s important to note that most prior weeks were adjusted upward as new deaths were reported. You might recall a few weeks ago when we learned that there had been deaths in California even before the first confirmed death in the United States. Those deaths were added to the CDC’s total for those weeks well after the fact.

The most recent estimate is from May 18. Here’s how the weekly death toll now compares with the data from May 1. Notice in particular the data from April 25, the most recent week for which data were available on May 1. In the last 17 days, the CDC’s estimated death toll that week has jumped by more than 8,000 cases — making up a big chunk of the “missing” deaths Ingraham was so worried about.

Looking at this cumulatively, you can see how the new estimate of total deaths compares with what was reported to the CDC on May 1. (The light-colored gray lines are the cumulative totals for each of the intervening estimates between May 1 and May 18.)

Note the May 2 figure, the closest end-of-week date to the article Ingraham linked. The May 18 estimate suggests that nearly 62,000 people had died by that date — a bit lower than the 66,000 attributed to the media at the time.

Again — and meaning no disrespect to my colleague Aaron Blake — this was not hard to figure out at the time. The CDC website itself indicated that the numbers were preliminary and would grow and, sure enough, they did.

But weeks after being placed in a medically induced coma, Cordero's wife, Amanda Kloots, announced Tuesday on Instagram that the Tony-award winning actor has finally woken up.

Holding her and Cordero's 10-month-old son Elvis, Kloots announced the progress on her Instagram story, saying, ""He is awake. ... We did it."" She added that he is still very weak from the medical issues he has faced, but that he is responsive and is following commands.

""Even closing his eyes, takes it out of him. They're waiting for him to regain strength, of course, time and recovery will help with that and then eventually PT will help him get stronger,"" she said. ""But he's a true superhero.""

She added that ""everything is looking good,"" but he still has a long road ahead of him to completely recover. He had first started showing signs of waking up on Mother's Day, she said.

""It's a very long road still… but we are in the beginning of recovery and him waking up,"" she posted. ""...What a miracle.""

Cordero was initially hospitalized March 30 after being diagnosed with pneumonia. He later tested positive for coronavirus, and was intubated April 1.

In addition to dealing with pneumonia, he also went into septic shock, had two ""mini strokes,"" had a temporary pacemaker placed, and suffered from blood clotting complications which resulted in his right leg being amputated, according to Kloots.

She told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King that the ordeal was ""terrifying,"" but that she has tried to remain positive throughout Cordero's healing process.

""I feel like there is an army of people behind him, behind us,"" she told King in April. ""… And I just believe — I get chills saying it — I just believe that he will wake up.""

Kloots has posted regularly about Cordero's condition since he was admitted to the hospital. One of her Instagram updates had a warning for those who doubt the coronavirus' potential impact on young adults, saying, ""This disease does not only effect old people. This is real. A perfectly healthy 41 year old man! ... STAY HOME! FOLLOW GUIDELINES!""

As many as ten contenders are hoping to present their credentials to the eight-member panel of Democratic Party leaders planning to meet in Berwyn on Wednesday to make the decision.

Organizers did not respond to requests for comment about their rationale for holding the meeting while the state is under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough, who doubles as Democratic committeeperson for Proviso Township, said candidates seeking the appointment will come before the committee one by one and the party leaders will be six feet apart.

Earlier in the day, the entire 80-member Cook County Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention to elect party officers online rather than in person.

It’s been a little over five weeks since Tobolski announced he was giving up his Cook County commissioner seat, and in that time the field of would-be successors has swelled, inching closer to the size of the entire 17-member County Board itself.

That could complicate the work of the committee that plans to make the appointment Wednesday at a special meeting of Democratic leaders.

Since Tobolski announced his resignation March 6, the field of potential replacements has ballooned from four, to six and now to possibly as many as 10 candidates, said Yarbrough, who is on the committee to pick Tobolski’s replacement in her role as Democratic Proviso Township committeeperson.

“It seems like everybody involved has someone [from their area] who’s interested in this seat,” Yarbrough said.

Including Yarbrough.

The clerk and longtime committeeperson said she was waiting to connect with a candidate from her area who works for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office.

In addition to Yarbrough, the committee to pick Tobolski’s replacement includes Ald. Ed Burke (14th); Berwyn Mayor Robert Lovero, who has the largest weighted vote; Blanca Vargas of Cicero; Barrett Pederson of Leyden Township; Bridgeview Mayor and state Sen. Steven Landek of Lyons Township; state Rep. Michael Zalewski of Riverside Township, and Vincent Cainkar of Stickney Township.

The eight-member group, all members of the Cook County Democratic Party, are scheduled to meet Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Italian-American Civic Organization of Berwyn. To be appointed, the candidate will need the weighted equivalent of 27,162 votes out of a possible 54,322.

Among the names of people said to be eyeing the position are Cicero realtor Eduardo Garcia, who founded Realty of Chicago in Berwyn; Victor Burgos, who works as an operating engineer in the county’s Department of Facilities Management; Mike Porfirio, the clerk of Lyons Township, and Frank Aguilar, a former Republican state representative elected to represent Cicero and Berwyn.

Burgos and Aguilar didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Porfirio pointed to his background and government experience in Lyons, Bridgeview and Summit to explain why he’d be “an effective commissioner.”

“I know the area well, and I think I would be able to represent the people very effectively,” Porfirio said. “I have a good pulse of what’s going on, and my experience would help me be a good public servant and steward to people.”

When asked about the job Tobolski did, Porfirio said the former commissioner was “visible” in the community but, with the cloud of a federal investigation looming over him, people want someone to “restore their faith and trust in government and public servants and I think we owe that to people — we owe it to people to be morally and ethically responsible.”

On March 6, Tobolski, who was first elected in 2010, resigned from both the County Board and his position as McCook village president effective March 31, according to the letters obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.

That move was sparked by the September search of Tobolski’s McCook Village Hall offices, although he gave no reason given for either of the resignations.

That raid was part of a suburban squeeze that came days after federal agents raided the home and offices of former Democratic state Sen. Martin Sandoval. A source told the Chicago Sun-Times the raids were related.

After the raid, the former commissioner missed a string of County Board and Forest Preserve meetings — he blamed health issues for missing those meetings and said at a December Forest Preserve meeting that he was still under a doctor’s care but “... it’s my picking or choosing as to how I feel, and I’m back today.”

Pat Doherty, Tobolski’s chief of staff, was indicted in February on three bribery charges.

For Garcia, who is also vying for the appointment, the opportunity is one that could help balance the scales of diversity on the board. Since the county is more than 30% Hispanic, at least four Latinos should hold seats on the board, Garcia said.

He also hopes to educate people in the community about what a commissioner does and to bring resources to all parts of the district.

“I’m not going to be a part-time commissioner — anything I’ve done in my life, I’ve given it 150%,” Garcia said. “We need someone at the table in Cook County to voice our concerns.”",real

Virus droplets can hang in the air for 14 minutes in a stagnant room. Wisconsinites flock to bars — yikes. News, business, life, and The Big 3.

BLODGET & PLOTZ

Be kind. We're all doing the best we can.

It's Friday. Here's good news.

Life in a long pandemic will require titrating risk — not eliminating it and not ignoring it, but understanding it and taking it into account. We're getting better at that.

As Aylin Woodward reports at Insider, it's becoming clear how to stamp out superspreader events. Superspreading tends to occur when an infected person has significant close contact with a group of people from a variety of households — usually in a midsize or large gathering, almost always indoors, usually in a place with limited air circulation. Superspreader events have included parties, religious services, choir practices, and sporting events.

We're starting to see how we can take measures to make ourselves safer — not safe! Americans in vast numbers are doing the right things, even without government orders.

We've all but eliminated large gatherings. Many people are wearing masks, especially indoors. We're washing hands. Businesses are figuring out how to improve air circulation, distance employees, and space out customers.

We're clearly anticipating — and accepting — moderate changes that will alter life until there's a vaccine: less travel, less mass entertainment, less gathering. And we're recognizing that these changes will savage some parts of the economy, like air travel, and cause massive adaptation in other parts, like dining out.

The fundamental conflicts in society — economic, political, racial — haven't been healed by the pandemic, and probably have been exaggerated. Americans are anxious. Their jobs and livelihoods are in danger. So it's not surprising that we're seeing brawls over masking and armed protests about lockdowns.

But the vast majority of us seek the same goal. We want to keep our loved ones safe from illness and be able to work and play. Except for a few people on the edges, there are no lockdown zealots who want to keep the country in cold storage forever and no reopen crazies who want to murder your grandmother.

We're all in the murky middle, and now that we've been through the initial panic and know what we need to do to prevent death on a vast scale, we're ready for an ambiguous next stage.

Our federal government has not really done its part to prepare and equip us, and that's tragic. But as citizens, we are all in the same boat. We're aware of the small and medium measures that will reduce risk — and the overwhelming majority of us are taking them.

Michael Brendan Dougherty puts this all beautifully in the National Review. We're not in a culture war, he says. Most of us are just trying to do what's right. So let's thank each other, and be generous:

""We are all muddling through, trying to live the best we can while this threat is out there. We are tempted to take out the frustration, anxiety, and anger these months have generated on each other. But what most of us need now is the mercy of basic kindness.""

Trump's Postal Service attack on Amazon is wrong

Postal agencies globally are carrying more packages than letters. But, it's companies like UPS, FedEx, and Amazon who have truly seen a boon from e-commerce and the explosion of parcel volumes. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

President Trump, who has never hidden his rage at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, who is also the CEO of Amazon, now appears to have taken his campaign to harm Bezos to another, more disturbing level. The US Postal Service, now stacked with Trump-appointed officials, will review what it charges huge package shippers — notably Amazon — perhaps as a prelude to hiking those rates and raising Amazon's costs.

The USPS's last-mile contracts with Amazon and others may well be mediocre contracts — there are lots of smart arguments on both sides of the issue — but the salient fact here is that the president has shown zero interest in the US Postal Service except insofar as it's a club to bash Amazon. You may remember that two years ago Trump personally tried to strong-arm the then postmaster general into doubling rates on Amazon.

And of course that's not the only example of Trump's malice toward Bezos and Amazon. The Defense Department and Amazon are still fighting over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract that was seemingly yanked from Amazon after Trump made it clear he didn't want Amazon to get it.

It's ridiculous to even have to say this, but it's wrong for a president to be picking winners and losers in any market. And it's monumentally wrong for the president to unleash the government against a private citizen because he owns a newspaper that sometimes criticizes him.

So far Bezos hasn't reined in the Post. He has stood up to attacks that have cost him and his shareholders billions of dollars. Not every media owner has the deep pockets and the courage to do that.

In the depths of Watergate, President Richard Nixon threatened the broadcasting licenses owned by then Washington Post owner Katharine Graham. What Trump is doing to Bezos and Amazon is worse. —DP

Beware 'pre-print' studies, especially when they appear to confirm your political biases

The world is studying and learning about the coronavirus in real time. Perhaps never before in history have so many researchers been so focused on the same topic at the same time. And perhaps never before have so many ""pre-print"" studies been released and mined for information.

What's a ""pre-print""? It's an early draft of a study that will be revised as it gets analyzed by other experts, the ""peer review"" process that acts as a quality-control mechanism in science and academia.

In normal times, preliminary studies are often shared only with peers. But now, given the extreme time sensitivity, many coronavirus pre-print studies are being published everywhere, and their initial findings widely discussed and distributed.

This is especially true when the initial findings appear to confirm the beliefs or hopes of a particular political team, with a built-in base of fans and amplifiers.

For example, The New York Times dives into what happened last month when a Stanford pre-print study was published that appeared to confirm the beliefs and hopes of some conservatives.

The study concluded that coronavirus infections were much more widespread than everyone believed — 85 times as widespread actually. If this finding had held up under scrutiny, it would have been excellent news. It would have meant that many more people had already been exposed to the coronavirus than everyone thought, and, therefore, that we as a society were much closer to ""herd immunity."" It might also have meant that the coronavirus was much less dangerous than everyone thought.

These initial findings also happened to fit the narrative that was popular with right-leaners — namely, that the coronavirus panic was, at best, ""dumb,"" and, at worst, a liberal hoax. Lockdowns weren't necessary, this story went. They were a gigantic overkill regulation pushed by members of a hyperactive Democratic nanny state. They were a cure that was worse than the disease.

As Aleszu Bajak and Jeff Howe of The New York Times explain, the initial findings of the study were seized on and shared by conservative commentators.

But, at the same time, peers of the scientists who published the study argued that the Stanford team had made some questionable assumptions that did not hold up under scrutiny. Within a day or two, in fact, it became clear that the study had overestimated the likely infection rate.

Experts still believe the number of actual coronavirus infections vastly outnumbers the number of confirmed infections. But the difference is likely far less extreme than the Stanford study initially suggested.

The same thing has happened with pre-print studies that confirm the ""prior"" or desired beliefs of left-wing commentators.

The rapid publication of pre-print studies are critical and helpful right now. The faster scientists can learn from each other and fact-check each other's work, the faster we will collectively learn about the coronavirus and how to best protect ourselves from it.

But everyone should keep in mind that pre-print means ""preliminary and subject to change."" —HB

How speaking transmits the coronavirus: Some of the droplets you emit when you talk hang in the air for 8 to 14 minutes

A new study — an edited study in a journal, not a pre-print — measured how long ""respiratory droplets"" hang in the air after people talk in an enclosed space with no ventilation.

The answer? As long as 14 minutes.

The experimenters had someone repeat the phrase ""stay healthy"" for 25 seconds in an enclosed room with stagnant air. They then measured how long it took the tiny speech droplets to evaporate or fall to a surface.

The researchers conclude: ""There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments."" —HB

Speaking of speaking ... some Wisconsin residents celebrated the ending of coronavirus restrictions by heading for places that fit the description for 'superspreader' environments described above — bars

William Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK via REUTERS

One effective way to transmit the coronavirus is to get close to someone in an enclosed indoor space with poor ventilation and speak loudly close to their face for a while.

In Seoul, South Korea, for example, the country's reopening was put on hold after a single ""spreader"" visited three nightclubs on a single night. South Korea has already traced 153 new infections, primary and secondary, to this one night on the town.

So for the sake of Wisconsinites, let's hope that no asymptomatic residents were among those who decided to celebrate by hitting the bars. —HB

YOUR LETTERS

On Wisconsin making the right decision to rein in its governor's emergency powers:

Booo to your promoting the notion of ""creeping executive overreach"" by governors.

Polls continue to show the American people mostly think their states are not moving too quickly. People are generally not in a hurry to go back ""out"" — they are afraid of getting sick, getting their family members sick, etc. A governor's job is to keep the people in the state safe. I cannot think of a single state where the governor has over-reached. My own state (North Carolina) has been very cautious and as a result we are nearing a decent plateau while remaining mostly closed. My point is there is little evidence of governors trying to ""grab"" power — most of them are making anguished decisions every day and their poll numbers are extremely high.

There do not have to be ""two sides"" to this. There is truth, there is science. Decisions are not easy since nobody knows everything about this novel virus, but the experts are amazingly consistent in their public health advice. Suggestions such as the one you made only serve to bolster the concept of there being two sides. I found it disappointing — I could hear that on Fox News any day of the week.

You are sick or you aren’t, which feels simple and knowable. In reality, most types of communicable disease are far less black and white: People are infected before they become aware that they’re sick. For much of the outbreak in the United States, local officials have asked people who suspect that they have COVID-19 but aren’t having serious trouble breathing to avoid seeking medical attention. That means that by the time most infections become official cases, people have spent days or weeks trying to heal on their own before seeking care. The periods of information lag with COVID-19 are longer than those of the colds and flus to which it’s often compared, which has been a central problem in containing the virus since the beginning. In order to make predictions and policy from any particular day’s case numbers, health experts have to synthesize information about testing rates, positive rates, local guidelines, and anything known about how people are responding to instructions to stay home or get back to business. And in order to make everyday decisions and assess their own risk, people have to live simultaneously in the past, present, and future.

Asking the general public to think in such broad and uncertain timescales is a tall order. “The concept of an incubation period or the onset of severe disease—those aren’t things that the public is well versed in, nor should we expect them to be,” says Tom Hipper, who manages the Center for Public Health Readiness and Communication at Drexel University. As a result, keeping the slow progression of a disease in mind can be difficult for regular people trying to make sense of official statistics. “As humans, I think we like instant gratification and we like instant feedback on things,” Hipper told me. The lull between new behavior and its measurable results “can make it a little more difficult to see the connection.”

Liz Neeley: How to talk about the coronavirus

The snail’s pace at which COVID-19 infections seem to run their course makes public-health communications about the state of the current outbreak unusually complicated. The available evidence suggests that it usually takes about five days for an infected person to go from transmission to symptoms, but it can take as long as 14 days and the person infected will be contagious for much of that time. The flu, by comparison, goes from transmission to symptoms in an average of two days and a maximum of four, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most people are infectious for only about a day before becoming ill.

Public-health experts can’t change the pace at which COVID-19 moves once a person is infected, but information doesn’t have to be delayed as much as it currently is in the U.S. The speed at which cases of the disease become known to the medical system, government monitors, and the general public depends on how hard a state or country is trying to find them. So far, the best-case scenario seems to be what’s happened in South Korea. In January and February, as the situation in Wuhan, China, deteriorated, South Korea quickly began identifying and isolating infectious travelers from the country, seeking the contacts of known cases, and testing those people before they became symptomatic. This program of testing, tracing, and swift isolation meant South Korea had something closer to real-time information about how the disease was spreading within its borders, and it was able to control the outbreak quickly. Such proactive approaches allowed South Korea, Germany, and Hong Kong to relax some of their restrictions on business and travel, and to quickly identify any new outbreaks that resulted. But even with those measures, all have experienced an uptick in new cases after reopening.",real

“I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” Biden told the black co-host, right to his face.

Later in the afternoon, Biden was forced to walk back his offensive remarks, but refused to outright apologize for them.

“I’ve never ever taken the African-American community for granted, had their support … I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy. I shouldn’t have been so cavalier,” Biden said later that day. “I don’t take it for granted at all, and no one, no one should have to vote for any party, based on their race or religion or background.”

Foxnews.com reports: Still, Biden’s remarks dominated the conversation on social media with the hashtags #YouAintBlack and #JoeBidenIsARacist trending on Twitter.

Fox News and MSNBC covered the dust-up throughout the day. ABC News, CBS News and NBC News all addressed the controversy on their evening programs.

However, CNN’s lack of coverage throughout the day was called out by critics.

“Fascinating to watch how the left-leaning cable networks have covered Biden’s ‘you ain’t black’ comment. MSNBC has discussed it nearly every hour… CNN hasn’t mentioned it once,” former CNN digital producer-turned-media critic Steve Krakauer tweeted.

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley pointed out the “crickets” coming from CNN. In the afternoon, Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called out the network for going hours without mentioning the controversy.

“It’s been over 5 HOURS since Biden told Black people they ‘ain’t black’ if they support @realDonaldTrump. How many times has CNN mentioned his bigoted comment on air? ZERO. Unreal,” McDaniel tweeted.

She later slammed the anti-Trump network for waiting until “12 hours” to mention Biden’s “bigoted remarks,” tweeting, “We all know that if a Republican made a similar comment, CNN would have reworked their entire day of programming to feature 9-person panels condemning it. The bias is unbelievable.”

“When you take into account how both MSNBC covered this repeatedly and Biden decided to issue a mea culpa, you’re left with no conceivable excuse for CNN other than they did so on purpose,” NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News. “Instead, they decided that trashing the administration for allowing houses of worship to reopen and gleefully touting negative hydroxychloroquine headlines were jobs one and two.”

Houck continued: “CNN has their insane way of going about their newsgathering, presentation and selection, but ignoring a story like this for hours and hours reminds us that their demands that other news organizations act like they do should not only be dismissed but laughed out of the room.”

CNN didn’t offer a full on-air report of Biden’s remarks until the end of the 7 p.m. ET hour, when anchor Erin Burnett spoke with Charlamagne tha God about the interview, making it the last major news network to report on Biden’s comments. It had articles published on the website earlier in the day.

Instead, the network spent much of the day offering critical coverage of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Jordan Chariton, co-founder of the progressive media outlet Status Coup, said CNN’s lack of coverage of the controversy is because the network “has been in the tank for Biden for over a year.”

“They dragged their feet on many stories related to him including him lying on being arrested in apartheid South Africa on his way to meeting Nelson Mandela,” Chariton told Fox News. “Outlets like CNN are protectors of the status quo and as such, they will always try and cover up bad stories for candidates like Biden rather than cover and challenge him.”

This isn’t the first time CNN’s on-air coverage has raised eyebrows. On Thursday, CNN bizarrely spent over 100 minutes covering President Trump’s refusal to wear a mask at the Ford plant. Meanwhile, the network spent just 15 minutes combined from Monday through Thursday covering the growing nursing-home controversy plaguing Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

A CNN insider told Fox News that while Trump should have worn the mask, the network is putting an undue emphasis on “what’s not important.”

“I don’t know why they focus on things like this when there are certainly more important things to focus on,” the network source said.

The insider knocked CNN, suggesting that if Trump found the cure for the coronavirus without wearing a mask, him not wearing the mask would become “the story” on the network.

Cuomo has largely gotten a pass from CNN, as the network has largely refrained from airing critical coverage of the Democrat governor. On Wednesday, he appeared for his 10th interview with his brother, “Cuomo Prime Time” anchor Chris Cuomo.

As in previous interviews, the CNN anchor made no mention of the growing death toll in New York nursing homes. Yet, he did manage to squeeze in some prop comedy, mocking the governor’s televised coronavirus test examination with overly-sized cotton swabs while poking fun at the size of his nose.

“CNN’s coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media: focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.

“This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN’s highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the governor,” Jacobson added. “Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.”

Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean told “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Thursday that Cuomo’s failed nursing-home policy should be “one of the biggest” stories of the year after both of her parents-in-law lost their lives to the coronavirus.

“I have not seen the coverage of this,” an emotional Dean said. “Twenty percent of our lost loved ones are from nursing homes … because Governor Cuomo and several other governors forced COVID-recovering patients into nursing homes.”

Dean, who rarely comments on political issues, felt compelled to speak out after watching Wednesday night’s CNN interview between the two playful Cuomo brothers.

“The fact that I am seeing, last night, him … making fun, inappropriate jokes and insensitive jokes, cruel jokes … make no mistake,” Dean said, “I am glad that Chris Cuomo has recovered from COVID because he apparently did have it. And I’m glad that their family is well, but my family is not well. And that is not something to joke about.”",fake
844,387,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229776/sti-hiv-increase-coronavirus-response-contact-tracing,2020-04-21,Health departments are concerned about spikes in STIs while attention is on COVID-19,"Across Idaho, the number of people getting tested for sexually transmitted infections and HIV has cratered. The Department of Health and Welfare is screening far fewer people than they did at this time last year, and many community organizations that do rapid HIV testing shut down when the state’s stay-at-home order went into effect on March 25th.

“Those things kind of just stopped,” says Kevin Brinegar, HIV prevention health program specialist at the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. “That’s concerning.”

Rates of sexually transmitted infections in the United States have been steadily climbing over the past few years, with rates of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia reaching an all-time high in 2018. Now, with COVID-19 pulling the majority of public health resources, local health departments are worried that they’ll lose even more ground.

“When the dust settles on coronavirus, we’re going to find out about all the public health issues that we haven’t been able to pay attention to”

“When the dust settles on coronavirus, we’re going to find out about all the public health issues that we haven’t been able to pay attention to, and how big of a problem they’ve gotten as they’ve kind of been under the radar,” says Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).

The NACCHO surveyed local health departments around the country to see how their HIV, STI, and viral hepatitis programs were affected by COVID-19 response efforts. Health departments reported that they’ve had to reduce or suspend some services, and that they’re concerned that those rollbacks will lead to outbreaks of diseases like syphilis, HIV, and chlamydia. Some jurisdictions have already seen increased clusters of cases.

Because of the pandemic, STI and HIV programs have limited the hours dedicated to testing and treatment clinics. “One of the most important things in the STI world is making sure that you can do open testing hours,” Casalotti says. “If you feel sick or not, you can come in, know your status, and get on your way. You can’t really do that anymore in this world of social distancing.” Clinics are also redirecting personal protective equipment to the front lines of the COVID-19 response.

In response, health departments are restructuring their priorities. Some reported that they were no longer able to start people on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication that can prevent HIV. “Individuals who have expressed interest in PrEP will be lost to care or [will] have been exposed to HIV by the time that we are able to provide PrEP services to them,” one department said in their survey response.

County health departments across Michigan have reduced some of their services, says Kristine Tuinier, manager of the division of HIV and STD programs at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. “I don’t think anyone is operating at full capacity,” she says. Most are focusing on working with people who have positive STI test results or symptoms of an infection, and they aren’t as able to screen people who feel fine.

“I don’t think anyone is operating at full capacity”

Clinicians are doing a more robust assessment of each person who comes in for testing and treatment, she says, and checking to see if a physical exam is necessary or if they can be treated without as much contact. Clinics are also using oral medications, rather than shots (which require physical contact with clinicians) to treat STIs like gonorrhea.

Many people in public health departments who usually work on STIs and HIV have also been pulled to work on the COVID-19 response. Management of STDs in communities uses some of the same methods used in the COVID-19 response — namely contact tracing, the process of finding out who may have been exposed to a disease.

In Michigan, specialists are splitting their schedules, devoting half of their time to STI work and half their time to COVID-19 contact tracing. Most Idaho health departments don’t have investigators devoted specifically to STIs to begin with — their experts all work on multiple diseases — but they have less time to devote to that response now.

“When you add something like this to the mix, it really bumps things down the priority list,” Brinegar says. “They’re staying on top of their HIV and syphilis investigations, but the way that they’re doing it and the time investment is more tailored.”

Those priorities will stay lopsided until the COVID-19 pandemic is more controlled, and it’s unclear how long that might take. “It’s not just that these people are being pulled off of their daily work in the STI space. It’s that they’re pulled off it and we don’t when they’ll be able to return to that work,” Casalotti says.

It’s not clear what the long-term impact of the novel coronavirus cuts might be for people at risk for various STIs. “We know that when we don’t pay attention to things, they bubble up and remind us,” Casalotti says. “That’s what could happen at the end of the coronavirus response.”

Many sexually transmitted infections can be asymptomatic, so it might take time for communities to realize that they have an outbreak. If untreated, they can also cause serious complications — so any undetected spread could have long-term consequences.

“Say you have a decrease in even condom availability,” Brinegar says. “If people rely on these clinic spaces to pick up free condoms routinely, and then all of a sudden that’s shut off — what’s that going to translate into?”

The challenges, though, are pushing health departments to innovate in the ways they provide care. Idaho’s health departments are looking into at-home test kits for various STIs. Michigan is trying to be more nimble in their work. “It’s changed the way we look at everything,” Tuinier says. “I think, moving forward, we’ll have gained some important skills in how we do our work.”

In addition, the proposed expansion of the COVID-19 contact tracing workforce might also benefit STI and HIV programs in the future. The coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to disease investigation experts.

“My hope is that when we can get back into kind of our normal day to day routine, there’s a community level awareness of who these folks are — that they’re not the sex police, they’re just trying to ensure public health,” Tuinier says. “I feel like that’s going to be one good outcome from all of this.”",real

While Georgia is slowly opening up, Betty McDonald is in a high-risk group for coronavirus and she can't go out to socialize. But she's found a new way to show off her outfits.

""I've got three closets full of clothes ... and jewelry like you wouldn't believe,"" McDonald told CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL. ""I mentioned to my caretaker that I sure miss getting dressed up."" Her caretaker, Kim Taylor, wanted to do something to help take their minds off the pandemic.

So they started holding daily fashion shows in the yard. ""Every day she does a different outfit, and I take pictures,"" Taylor told the station.

Taylor has snapped countless photos of McDonald in flowing skirts, elaborate baubles and interesting hats. All of her outfits are perfectly coordinated. ""I like flashy stuff, as you can tell,"" McDonald said.

McDonald's husband passed away in 2007 and she doesn't have any kids. She has Taylor send the photos and videos from their fashion shows to family, friends and neighbors to lift their spirits, WGCL reports.

""She has lots of people telling her that it's reminded them that there's more to life than watching television, and hearing the latest on COVID-19,"" Taylor said.

After Taylor put some of their videos on YouTube, she ""received almost 200 comments and she loved sitting down and telling me what to type for her responses,"" Taylor told CBS News via email. ""She is like a kid on Christmas Day opening up many gifts.""

The pandemic hasn't been easy on McDonald, who loves being outside, traveling and socializing. ""It's a very sad time, it's heartbreaking,"" she told WGCL.

She was anxious about the coronavirus, but the fashion shows have helped take her mind off of things.

""At 91, she is in the high-risk group as far as if something should happen, and she told me once, I don't know how much longer I have to live, yet she can find joy in doing something for today,"" Taylor said.",real

It seems these months of quarantine-life and a growing list of COVID-19 symptoms are leading many to think back to that stubborn cold from back in February or that sudden stomach bug that hit in March and wonder if it really was the coronavirus.

Call it “I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

But a hospital study in New York City has found that out of hundreds of New Yorkers who thought they potentially had COVID-19 in the last three months but never received a confirmed clinical diagnosis, only 37% tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign the body was previously likely infected and fought the virus.

“That does imply that likely many of the people who suspect that they had this probably didn't have it,” said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, one of the authors of the Mount Sinai study and an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine. “You can't assume that you had it just because you didn't feel well a few months ago.”

In comparison, 99% of New Yorkers tested by Mount Sinai who had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis did have antibodies, the cornerstone of the body’s immune response to a virus, the researchers reported.

Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor, said he, too, had a bit of ""I-think-I-had-it-itis.""

""As someone who actually was convinced that they had been infected and then tested negative, it’s clear that many of us have been in the same boat,"" he said. ""What we need to remember is that COVID-19 was circulating at the same time as a number of respiratory viruses likely creating confusion on the origin of infection.""

Brownstein said the new data suggests that the U.S. could be ""a ways off [from] herd immunity and further demonstrates the need of testing capacity.""

The findings were among the first to come out of Mount Sinai’s monumental antibody testing program, which is now performing over 3,000 tests a day, tallying over 25,000 people so far. The study, which was published earlier this month and has not been peer-reviewed, looked at the initial 1,343 people tested in the program, including those who had previously confirmed coronavirus infections and those who suspected, or were told by their doctors, that they likely did but were not tested.

The broader aim of the antibody program is to identify donors for convalescent plasma, an experimental treatment sometimes used for seriously ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

“We've given convalescent plasma to hundreds of patients at the Mount Sinai health system, and that's been a good thing to be part of,” Wajnberg said. “And it's also helping us learn about potential immunity.”

MORE: What can a COVID-19 antibody test tell us?

Researchers at Mount Sinai were among the first in the U.S. to develop an antibody test and received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration in April. There are currently 13 such tests with EUA in the U.S.

This week, Mount Sinai announced it is beginning to commercially produce its antibody test with a goal of testing more than 10 million patients per month by July.

Antibody tests are distinct from what are called diagnostic coronavirus tests, which look for live virus currently infecting the body. The Mount Sinai study said the results suggest ""the optimal time frame for widespread antibody testing is at least three to four weeks after symptom onset and at least two weeks after symptom resolution.""

He was the third person to die of COVID-19 while jailed, and 353 incarcerated people and 261 staff have since then tested positive.

“I feel like I lost the battle for my husband,” Lee’s widow told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Most people in Cook County Jail have not been convicted of any crime, and are being held because they don’t have the money to post bail. But even as the number of people in the jail who are sick with COVID-19 increases, another week has passed without significant action by county officials to reduce the jail population.

Opinion

Social distancing is impossible in the crowded and unsanitary confines of the jail, which is now one of the foremost sites of the pandemic in the nation. Close quarters create a kind of Russian roulette death penalty for people awaiting trial. COVID-19 cases soon could overwhelm the jail’s health systems, creating chaos and making the facility difficult to secure. County leaders must rapidly find ways to responsibly release people and provide housing and safe quarantine outside of the jail.

As researchers, we have been tracking the ways that jails and prisons increase the spread of COVID-19. There are still more than 4,300 people being held in Cook County Jail, and the rate of spread of the virus is about 33 times higher inside the jail than it is in the city of Chicago.

African Americans are jailed disproportionately in Cook County, and this crisis is further heightening racial inequality. While the courts have slowed the number of people entering the jail, releases have not risen to the level required to prevent mass deaths. Each day that passes without a significant reduction in the jail population imperils the health of incarcerated people, jail employees and their families, as well as the health of all those who live in the surrounding communities.

The pandemic is revealing the ways in which Cook County has used the jail to address a myriad of social problems; many people are held in jail because they have an addiction, are homeless, or struggle with mental illness. According to the Chicago Community Bond Fund, at least 260 people languish in jail simply because they are poor and cannot afford to post a low cash bond. Those who pose no threat to public safety should not be held in jail, but Cook County’s social safety net is thin, so jail is often used in place of a homeless shelter or psychiatric hospital.

In mid-March, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx and Public Defender Amy Campanelli worked together to identify a list of hundreds of people who could be released from jail without posing a threat to public safety. While an important first step, this process was not exhaustive, and many more cases should be considered for release.

It is time for Cook County officials, Chief Judge Tim Evans and Criminal Division Chief Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. to get back to the table, identify all people who can be safely released and create a process for expedited hearings and releases. If they don’t, it could soon become impossible to provide medical care for the number of cases in the Cook County Jail, and these cases threaten to overwhelm the county’s medical systems.

Sheriff Tom Dart has taken steps to improve sanitation and distancing practices in the jail, including the moving of people to single cells, but no one can meaningfully control the spread of COVID-19 or prevent mass deaths in a crowded jail. Hand soap and sanitizer are rationed, hundreds of people share bathrooms, and health care is in short supply. Even when assigned to single cells, people sleep within a few feet of one another.

It is not too late to responsibly release people from Cook County Jail, strengthening the county’s efforts to flatten the curve of the spread of the coronavirus. A coalition of civil rights groups has sued Dart in federal court to secure the immediate release of many of those being held in the jail. On April 9, a federal court sent the suit back to a state court, creating further delays.

Cook County leaders should look to San Francisco, where efforts to control COVID-19 in the local jail have been swift and effective. The San Francisco district attorney and public defender worked together to quickly reduce the jail population by 40%. They assessed who was safe for release, including the elderly, some veterans, those being held for misdemeanors, those awaiting placement in a mental health facility, those being detained simply because of an inability to pay bail, and those already scheduled for release.

San Francisco has proved that mass release can be done safely.

Just as Mayor Lori Lightfoot acted quickly to repurpose McCormick Place to treat COVID-19 cases, fast action must be taken to depopulate the jail now, so that detainees and community members alike can effectively practice social distancing.

Lightfoot has led efforts to turn empty downtown hotels into housing for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have mild symptoms. Why can’t empty hotel rooms across the city be used to house those who need a safe place to quarantine after release from jail?

Creative housing solutions that offer people a safe two-week quarantine upon release, along with greatly expanded access to testing for COVID-19 for everyone in contact with the jail, could save the lives not only of incarcerated people, but also jail workers and others.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”

In this case, justice delayed is spiking the curve and putting everyone’s lives in danger.

Updated at 10:17 p.m. ET

Hours after the White House rejected the idea of appointing a coronavirus czar, President Trump on Wednesday put Vice President Pence in charge of the administration's response to the disease.

""We're doing really well, and Mike is going to be in charge,"" Trump said, noting that Pence's experience as governor of Indiana made him adept at working with state and local health authorities.

""This is not a czar,"" the president later added.

The president's remarks came as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disclosed a new case of the COVID-19 disease in California that could represent the first U.S. case of the virus spreading within the general population.

At the White House news conference alongside members of the administration's coronavirus task force and health officials, the president insisted that the risk to the American people from the virus ""remains very low.""

He also noted that the ""regular flu"" kills many more people each year. He took credit for making ""very good early decisions"" that helped prevent the new coronavirus from becoming more widespread in the United States.

""We're ready to adapt and ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads,"" he said, adding that he plans to add an unnamed specialist from the State Department to the White House team.

Trump said he would work with Congress on funding. His administration has asked for $2.5 billion, but he said lawmakers appear amenable to offering much more money.

""Congress is making it very easy. ... It wasn't very easy for the wall, but we got that one done,"" he said.

Pence praised the president for the current containment strategy, including travel restrictions, quarantine measures and assembling of a coronavirus task force ""that has been meeting every day.""

""As a former governor of the state with the first MERS case, I know full well the importance of presidential leadership and administration leadership and the vital role"" of state and local agencies, Pence said, referring to Middle East respiratory syndrome.

In the latest case, the CDC said it was unclear how the patient got the virus. According to officials, the infected person reportedly did not have a history of travel to a region where the virus is spreading — or exposure to another person known to have COVID-19.

The CDC says it's possible that the person may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected.

During the news conference, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, appeared to walk back statements made by her colleague, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who on Tuesday suggested a large outbreak is imminent.

Still, Schuchat said the CDC expects more cases and cautioned local and state institutions to review pandemic preparedness plans.

As of Wednesday, the coronavirus disease COVID-19, which was first diagnosed in Hubei province in mainland China, has reached 37 other countries, according to World Health Organization officials.

""Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing in Geneva.

The number of confirmed cases globally has surpassed 81,000, according to a dashboard created by Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering. More than 30,000 of those are cases in which people recovered from COVID-19.

Concern over the virus and the United States' preparedness have reached both sides of the political aisle in Washington as the administration has already run out of money in its infectious-disease rapid-response reserve fund.

On Wednesday morning, Democrats and Republicans grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar as he appeared before a House Appropriations subcommittee. The administration is requesting an additional $2.5 billion to combat the respiratory virus.

But many lawmakers see that as an inadequate sum to confront the challenges of a potential health crisis and are crafting emergency response packages ranging from $4 billion to $8.5 billion.",real

874,1957,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-cannabis-can-help-fight-coronavirus.html,2020-05-23,"Cannabis can help fight coronavirus, study says","(Natural News) Cannabis could be a new weapon in the fight against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19),Â researchers say.Â A new study by scientists at theÂ University of Lethbridge in AlbertaÂ says that cannabidiol (CBD) — the main non-psychoactive component of marijuana —Â can help fight the coronavirus by lowering the number of cell receptors available for the latter to attach to.

âThereâs a lot of documented information about cannabis in cancer, cannabis in inflammation, anxiety, obesity and whatnot,â said Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, who co-authored the study alongside his wife, Dr. Olga Kovalchuck, and a team of other researchers from Lethbridge. âWhen COVID-19 started, Olga had the idea to revisit our data, and see if we can utilize it for COVID.â

âIt was like a joker card, you know, coronavirus. It just mixes up everybodyâs plans,â Olga added.

The Kovalchuksâ have been working with cannabis since 2015, using varieties from around the world to create new hybrids and develop extracts that demonstrate certain therapeutic properties.

CBD reduces available ACE2 receptors for the virus to latch on to

For the study, published in pre-peer review server Preprints, the researchers partnered with cannabis therapy research company Pathway Rx — of which Igor KovalchuckÂ is the CEO —Â andÂ cannabinoid-based research company Swysh.

The team created 3D tissue modelsÂ withÂ human oral,Â mucociliary and intestinal tissues and tested them with different samples of high CBD extracts. The extracts were low in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. (Related: CBDÂ vs. coronavirus? Potential natural remedies that promote immunity.)

With this setup, the researchers thenÂ observed the effect that the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor that the virus uses to enter human cells.

The results of the researchersâ tests demonstrated that the extracts helped reduce the number of these receptors that the coronavirus could use to âhijackâ host cells.

âA number of them have reduced the number of [ACE2] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,â stated Igor.

âIf they can reduce the number of receptors, thereâs much less chance of getting infected,â he added.

In addition to ACE2, the researchers also looked into other receptors such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.

âImagine a cell being a large building,â explained Kovalchuk to CTV News.Â âCannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. So, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.â

Clinical trials still needed but exploring therapeutic options is important

The researchersâ early findings indicate that the CBD extracts could be used in inhalers, mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and home treatment.

However, they say that people looking for CBD extracts to fight the coronavirus wonât be able to do so at their local dispensaries yet. They state that the current medical cannabis and CBD products, while helpful for a lot of ailments, are not designed to treat or prevent infection from COVID-19.

âThe key thing is not that any cannabis you would pick up at the store will do the trick,â said Olga.

With this in mind, the researchers are now actively pursuing clinical trials. They stressed that their data is already based on human tissue models, so these trials are a natural next step.

They also highlight the importance of exploring every therapeutic option when it comes to fighting the coronavirus.

âGiven the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered.â

âWe need to bring it to the people,â says Olga. âWe need to fight the beast.â

Under the new rules, buses, taxis and three-wheelers will return to the streets but with restrictions. Buses will not carry more than 20 passengers, each of whom will be screened before boarding, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

“Corona will stay, and we will also survive,” Kejriwal said, outlining the new guidelines for the city of 20 million people that has one of highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the country.

However, a factory of the Chinese smartphone maker OPPO near Delhi suspended operations after six workers tested positive for the coronavirus.

The factory had received government permission to resume limited production as part of a gradual relaxation of the shutdown that began on March 25.

But when OPPO tested workers prior to the restart, six tested positive for COVID-19, said Deep Chandra, senior official at the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority.

OPPO said in a statement that operations at the plant were suspended and it would only allow employees with negative test results to resume work.

Karnataka, home to technology hub Bengaluru, also lifted some restrictions on the movement of trains, taxis and buses within the state. Transportion from outside the state will remain suspended except for essential services.

Experts say that coronavirus cases will rise in coming weeks as India’s lockdown is eased, and authorities have repeatedly told companies resuming operations to ensure that social distancing and other measures are taken to prevent infections.

MIGRANT WORKERS

India has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus infections in recent days, with confirmed cases at around 96,000 and more than 3,000 deaths, according to federal data.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government extended the nationwide lockdown to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases and allowed state governments to issue their own guidelines on some matters.

With the restrictions eased, some traffic poured back onto the roads of the capital, and hairdressers, beauty parlours, stationary shops, and butchers were among the small businesses reopening elsewhere in the country.

But schools, malls and other public places will remain mostly closed, and large gatherings are still prohibited.

Compounding the challenges for the country, hundreds of millions of migrant workers have been stranded across India for weeks, unable to return home after authorities banned all transport services in late March.

After a series of road and rail accidents, where dozens of workers died, authorities are now increasing efforts to help them home.

879,1888,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/05/weary_michiganders_got_an_unwelcome_surprise_from_governor_gretchen_whitmer.html,2020-05-23,Weary Michiganders got an unwelcome surprise from Governor Gretchen Whitmer,"When the Bourbon dynasty, which had been brutally dethroned during the French Revolution, returned to the throne upon Napoleon’s downfall in 1814, the two Bourbon kings tried unsuccessfully to turn back the clock. The French diplomat Talleyrand said of them, “They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.”

Using that metric, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer is giving the Bourbon monarchs a run for their money. On Friday, she announced that her beleaguered state would remain locked down through the last minute of June 12.

During this time of coronavirus, Whitmer has distinguished herself as the governor with both the harshest and most random lockdown orders. Whitmer’s “Stay Home, Stay Safe Executive Order” went into effect on March 23. At the time, several states were going into lockdown mode, ostensibly to “flatten the curve” – that is, to slow the disease’s spread so that medical facilities would not be overwhelmed. Whitmer, like several other governors, quarantined everyone, locking them in their homes except for allowing them to go to major chain stores or to work for (and still get paid by) the government.

Whitmer’s orders included carveouts for activities that raised taxes or advanced social policies (allowing alcohol, pot, and lottery tickets purchases, as well as abortions). At the same time, she almost randomly issued orders affecting harmless or constitutionally protected behavior, such as banning travel to vacation homes, forcing stores to close whole sections, banning store advertising and hydroxychloroquine, and forbidding jet skiing and outdoor gardening.

While Whitmer has backed off of some of her more extreme bans (e.g., store advertising, hydroxychloroquine), that hasn’t stopped her from being controversial. Her administration waged a brutal war against a 77-year-old barber who had to choose between ignoring her ban against personal grooming services or starving.

On Thursday, a judge finally set the matter to rest by ruling in favor of Karl Manke’s barbershop, but not before hundreds of people, both barbers and customers, gathered outside the Michigan Capitol to give and receive protest haircuts. Michigan is not the only state preventing people from grooming, but the optics of waging war against a 77-year-old barber in Owosso, a town of only 15,194 people outside of Lansing, were ugly.

Meanwhile, unlike Whitmer, we’ve all learned a few things: The Wuhan virus is not easily transmissible from casual surface contact, the mortality rate is significantly lower than initially thought, Vitamin D helps, medical facilities have not been overrun, states that opened early have had fewer deaths, and 29.7% of Wuhan virus deaths occurred in the Michigan nursing homes that Whitmer had forced to accept sick patients.

Aside from having a naturally tyrannical streak, Whitmer is also aiming for bigger things than the Michigan statehouse. The Democrats’ probable candidate, Joe Biden, has confirmed that she’s one of the people on his shortlist for a running mate. Whitmer is therefore working to distinguish herself by opposing Trump as hard as possible (see the hydroxychloroquine ban, above).

For the past couple of days, Whitmer and her attorney general, Dana Nessel, another strident leftist, have been garnering headlines by complaining that President Trump failed to wear a mask when he visited a Ford plant in Ypsilanti. Indeed, Nessel went so far as to say that the president is no longer welcome in Michigan and threatened to sue the Ford plan for violating the state’s mask rules. The fact that Trump (a) is regularly tested for the virus and (b) wore the mask when not giving a speech didn’t matter to leftists anxious to show how tough they are.

Given her personality and political posturing, should anyone be surprised that Whitmer has announced that her state’s stay-at-home order, originally scheduled to end next Thursday, will continue until 11:59 p.m. on June 12, with Michiganders still forced to remain flabby and ungroomed?

Earlier this week, the governor did allow social gatherings of 10 people or fewer to resume and retail stores to arrange appointment-only shopping for customers. But things like gyms, hair salons and barbershops remain closed.

Michiganders are already getting restless under their governor’s arbitrary and capricious rule. It’s entirely possible, therefore, that at some point they will break and engage in mass civil disobedience.

The Michigan unemployment rate hit 22% three weeks ago and is still rising. Sooner rather than later, Michigan citizens need to remind their political class that they are public servants, not monarchs. While Whitmer, in true Bourbon fashion, has learned nothing and forgotten nothing, it’s to be hoped that the people of her state will do better than that.

Postscript: This post just touches upon the lockdown. We also know now that Whitmer’s Green policies affected the dams that broke, flooding several communities in an already hard-hit state.",fake
880,529,https://humansarefree.com/2020/04/taiwan-no-lockdowns-covid-19.html,2020-04-30,"TAIWAN: No Lockdowns, No Closed Businesses, Non-WHO Member, and Relatively Unaffected by COVID-19","Johns Hopkins University had predicted that Taiwan would have the second most COVID-19 cases in the world, due to its close proximity to Mainland China.

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 400 cases of COVID-19, and only 6 deaths. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

All of this has happened without shutting down the country with lock downs, and with almost all of its businesses continuing to operate.

Is Taiwan doing something else the rest of the world is largely missing?

This question will no doubt be asked for months or even years into the future, but it is a question well worth asking, given the devastating effects to the economy that have resulted from more restrictive measures such as the United States took.

The first thing to note is that while President Trump is now looking seriously at pulling out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan was never part of it. They were not allowed to join due to the WHO’s pro-China stance.

According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan’s CDC tried to warn China and WHO on December 31, 2019 about possible human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, while China was still denying that such transmission was possible.

That same day, Taiwan started policies to monitor travel from China to reduce the chance of having the coronvirus come into their country. They were one of the first countries to restrict travel from China at their borders.

Taiwan had bad experiences from the 2003 SARS (another coronavirus) outbreak in China, and as a result their hospitals were well supplied with equipment to handle any outbreaks.

This SARS situation had reportedly taught them to have a healthy distrust in China and the World Health Organization to accurately report facts, and to have their own plan in place for future outbreaks.

But unlike the U.S. and many other countries, Taiwan did not quarantine the entire nation.

They focused on quarantining travelers coming in from abroad in their own homes, while the rest of the nation went about their business, with some restrictions in place such as wearing face masks, and practicing social distancing.

It is hard to argue with their reported results so far, with so few actual cases and very few deaths. They kept the country open, and did not destroy their economy.

John Ransom, reporting for TownHall Finance writes:

Protests in the streets, oil trading at negative numbers, rapidly spiraling unemployment, locked-down international travel and trade: I think we can all agree that by any barometer, including these, the world has failed the Wuhan flu test.

Why the world’s answer to the China flu has been so disastrously wrong, ill-thought out and ignorant to reality can be left to future post-mortems. But after spending literally trillions on public health over the decades to prevent just such an occurrence, it’s clear by now that the world’s investment in public health professionals was wasted.

We can debate whether the cost was worth it, but there is no denying that the cost has been beyond anyone’s imagining.

Some may argue that in such a crisis, experts faced a no-win situation where they had to either trade lives for the economy or the economy for lives.

To that I give a one-word answer: Taiwan.

Taiwan is the other “China”. It’s a small island off the southern coast of China, called the Republic of China (ROC). It was created as a bastion of “free” China as the Communist Party took over mainland China (PRC).

The island may be small, but the country is a regional and worldwide powerhouse. It’s the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP), despite having a population of just 24 million. It ranks 11th in GDP per capita, comparable to Denmark and Sweden.

It’s also an important partner with Communist China as one of the leading investors, trading partners and bankers for the PRC. Consequently, Taiwan hosts quite a bit of contact with the PRC.

For comparison sake, the United Sates saw about 3 million visitors from China in 2018, while Taiwan hosted 2.6 million visitors from China in 2018.

That’s why the results from Taiwan in fighting China’s Wuhan flu—as they call it in Taiwan—is so extraordinary.

Worldwide there have been 321 cases of COVID-19, or Wuhan flu, per million people. In Taiwan there have been just 0.3 cases per million people for a total of 422 cases, with only six total deaths.

Equally important is that while the Taiwanese economy has been damaged by the global shutdown, their domestic economy and society has remained open. (Source and Full Article Here.)

We report these results as a comparison to what other actions have been taken in other countries, that have had far more disastrous results.

We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19?

Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower?

Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

About the only thing we do know for sure, is that the vaccine gods and their global leaders like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and the WHO cannot take credit for Taiwan’s success, because they never were able to successfully develop a vaccine for SARS, and they have successfully kept Taiwan out of the WHO.

Writer Marc A. Thiessen offers his perspective:

This pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies — one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship.

Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny.

The antidote to the coronavirus is freedom. (Source)

It said it would close an undisclosed number of stores as part of the restructuring process.

The department store has been in the midst of a turnaround plan in order to reduce its roughly $4 billion in debt.

It was forced to temporarily close all of its 850 stores amid the coronavirus pandemic but began to reopen certain locations at the beginning of May.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

JCPenney has filed for bankruptcy, with the 118-year-old company buckling under pressure from the coronavirus.

The company joins the growing list of large clothing retailers forced to file for bankruptcy protection, joining Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, and True Religion.

It said it would close an undisclosed number of stores as part of the restructuring process.

Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported on April 14 that the department store chain was exploring bankruptcy after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to temporarily close all of its 850 stores.

On April 15, CNN Business reported that the company had missed a debt payment and invoked a 30-day grace period. It also skipped a second payment on May 7. The company has nearly $4 billion in debt.

In a May 14 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JCPenney said it had made a $17 million interest payment.

It began to reopen stores in certain states at the beginning of May, implementing safety measures like plexiglass at registers and contactless curbside pickup.

""Until this pandemic struck, we had made significant progress rebuilding our company under our Plan for Renewal strategy — and our efforts had already begun to pay off. While we had been working in parallel on options to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our financial runway, the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt,"" CEO Jill Soltau said in a press release about the bankruptcy filing.

The company said it had secured $900 million in debtor-in-possession financing as part of its bankruptcy filing.

JCPenney has faced years of struggles, failing to turn a profit since 2011. Like many other department stores, it's faced slumping sales as shoppers increasingly turn to online options and mall foot traffic declines. It has also faced stiff competition in off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. Frequent changes to the executive team and shifting strategies did not help matters.

It attempted to rebrand itself several times, first chasing after younger shoppers before reverting back to trying to attract middle-aged women shopping for their family.

""JCPenney hasn't created an experience that solidifies a place in consumers' shopping habits,"" Kathy Gersch, executive vice president of the consultancy firm Kotter, told Business Insider in 2018. In a separate interview, Gersch said, ""They are creating an experience that isn't right for anyone. They are trying to serve too many people at the moment.""

JCPenney has closed dozens of stores in recent years, including six stores and a Kansas customer service center that permanently shuttered at the beginning of 2020. It reported that comparable sales decreased by 7.7% for the fiscal year ending February 1.

JCPenney had been in the midst of a turnaround plan, spearheaded by CEO Jill Soltau, that involves reducing inventory and sharpening its focus on its core audience of middle-class families.

Read the full statement from Soltau:

""The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for our families, our loved ones, our communities, and our country. As a result, the American retail industry has experienced a profoundly different new reality, requiring JCPenney to make difficult decisions in running our business to protect the safety of our associates and customers and the future of our company. Until this pandemic struck, we had made significant progress rebuilding our company under our Plan for Renewal strategy – and our efforts had already begun to pay off. While we had been working in parallel on options to strengthen our balance sheet and extend our financial runway, the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.

Implementing this financial restructuring plan through a court-supervised process is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come. We believe the RSA and the widespread support we have received from our asset-based lenders and first lien lenders will allow us to pursue a financial restructuring on an expedited timeframe. We are also encouraged by the level of support we have received from our vendor partners, landlords, and other stakeholders, whose confidence in our business and our people is expected to contribute to a successful reorganization.

We have a newly refreshed, highly experienced team of retail executives who remain focused on rebuilding our business and restoring financial strength to JCPenney. This team has continued to innovate even during these challenging times, implementing substantial improvements to our flagship eCommerce platform to increase efficiency and ensure our loyal customers continue to have access to the products they need through elevated shopping experiences. I would also like to thank all of our outstanding associates for their continued dedication to our company and their passion for meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations. We are continuing to serve our customers as we move through this process with a commitment to working seamlessly with our vendor partners and landlords. We look forward to emerging from both Chapter 11 and this pandemic as a stronger retailer, continuing to implement our Plan for Renewal, and building capabilities focused on satisfying customers' wants and needs.""",real

Fauci, the institutional face of the coronavirus response and head of the White House coronavirus Task Force, suddenly changed his tune this week about reopening the country despite advocating for shutdowns just days earlier.

“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said Friday on CNBC.

“Now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.”

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that,” Fauci added.

Fauci’s sudden change of heart regarding the lock downs caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during “Tucker Carlson” tonight.

“I don’t mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he’s saying,” Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, “and I think it’s OK to say ‘I really don’t know, guys.'”

“But I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or ‘What does one plus one equal?’ you’re going to get seven different answers.”

“I think at this point, you let people — individuals — make decisions for themselves,” he added. “The only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.”

Fauci, Big Pharma and the Mainstream Media would have you believe that vaccine injuries are RARE, but when the reports start piling up of all the damage caused by the exact vaccines Fauci has touted, it’s important to start asking how rare they actually are…

Opinion columnist

I have no hope that Donald Trump will ever behave like a president of all 50 United States. But I ask one simple thing from him and his son: Please stop trying to get my fellow Americans killed.

It’s impossible to keep track of all the norms Trump is petulantly stomping on as he runs for reelection amid the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.

As the American death toll from COVID-19 has moved closer to 100,000, he has fired inspector general after inspector general, the only independent watchdogs inside the executive branch. His lawyers have argued before the Supreme Court that this president should essentially be immune from all prosecution and oversight, denying taxpayers the right to know whether he’s even a taxpayer. And @realdonaldtrump has gone into overdrive with his wild tweets and rhetoric, which he has to know could make his more unhinged supporters think he’s hoping they’ll get violent.

And some seem to be getting the message!

Trump's troubling QAnon retweets

Detroit real estate agent Robert Sinclair Tesh has been arraigned on a terrorism charge after he made what authorities determined were credible death threats against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel. We can’t say for sure whether the man behind the alleged threats was a Trump fan. But he does appear to be a fan of the conspiracy theory known as QAnon, having used hashtags associated with the movement.

This arrest ties together two of the most dangerous threads of what rhetoric professor Jennifer Mercieca describes as Trump’s “argument ad baculum” in her forthcoming book, ""Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump."" These “appeals to the stick,” or implicit threats of force or intimidation, are “used by a demagogue to attack and overwhelm opponents,” Mercieca writes.

Trump has literally incited Michiganders to rise up against their governor with a “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” tweet that former Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord called illegal. And he has cheered on the so-called protesters who’ve garnered national attention by flooding into Michigan’s Capitol brandishing firearms, something you’d never be allowed to do at an NRA convention when Vice President Mike Pence is speaking.

But it’s the connection to the QAnon movement that’s most troubling about this arrest.

While there are always oaky traces of a death cult inside the Republican Party — “pro-lifers” fulminating for unnecessary wars and executions — the calls to sacrifice American (especially older Americans) to “the economy” have become audible as the death toll from COVID-19 has risen.

But QAnon is a literal death cult. It imagines crimes, often cannibalism and pedophilia, that would justify the arrest and even execution of the president's opponents and enemies. And it’s also a domestic terror threat, according to liberal fake news sources such as the FBI.

What Republicans don't get: Donald Trump is our biggest obstacle to coronavirus recovery

Either violent people are attracted to this fantasy — which originally touted Trump as an all-powerful crusader bound to take down international child sex rings and now seems more interested in spreading COVID-19 misinformation to justify Trump’s panoply of failures — or individuals who are into Q just happen to enjoy making criminal threats or killing a family member with a sword.

Of course, the big joke of all this is that Trump is the guy who started a teen beauty pageant, and several former contestants said Trump walked in on them while they were in various states of undress. And the one big name child sex offender this administration has arrested — former Trump playmate Jeffrey Epstein — died mysteriously in the custody of Trump’s Department of Justice, an unresolved crime that stinks of a real conspiracy.

Still, the deluded QAnon cult chugs on as an implicit threat on Trump’s behalf. And the president has rewarded its fealty with at least 131 retweets.

Tickling death cult bone of dad's fans

Anyone paying any attention knows that when Donald Trump Jr. makes a joke about former Vice President Joe Biden being a pedophile, he’s trying to tickle the death cult bone of his dad's fan base. And when Don Jr. pretends to back off by then reiterating the charge, he’s showing that he has learned his daddy’s “I’m not saying; I'm just saying” rhetorical trick of paralipsis.

Mercieca says that's what demagogues use ""to circulate rumors and accusations, to ironically say two things at once, and to build a relationship with supporters.”

I get the desperation.

The Trumps' best attempt at digging up foreign dirt on Biden resulted in impeachment and the revelation that Biden was actually leading the international community’s efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.

They haven’t found any attack on Biden yet that tanks him the way they smeared a woman for using personal email. And older voters are telling pollsters that they may be abandoning Trump. (Maybe because they’ve heard that some Republicans think they should stop complaining about COVID-19 and start dying.)

Trump impeachment intimidation: Weaponized Twitter feed, die-hard fans who get the 'code'

This is all bound to get more intense as Trump feels the risk of losing the one job in the United States that prevents him from being indicted. The question is how many people the Trumps are willing to take down with them.

The president’s steaming rhetoric may have influenced his superfan Cesar Sayoc, who was convicted of mailing bombs to 13 Trump opponents — including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The only thing that saved us from this Trump fan carrying out one of the worst terror attacks in American history was his incompetence.

But as Trump’s election proved, competence isn’t necessary for success.

So please, Mr. President, stop trying to get us killed. COVID-19 is bad enough on its own.

889,998,https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-businesses-coronavirus-hair-salons-2020-5,2020-05-15,Business owners in Georgia are divided on whether they should actually reopen,"Three weeks after Georgia lifted coronavirus-related business restrictions, business owners are divided on how to proceed.

Some business owners, like tea shop owner Brandi Shelton, fear the reopening of the economy was rushed and irresponsible.

Others, like salon owner Melissa Singleton, were comfortable opening with new safety precautions.

Data showed that more than 60,000 people visited Georgia from out of state after businesses reopened, leading experts to fear a spike in coronavirus cases.

View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.

Three weeks after Georgia became one of the first states to reopen its economy, business owners in the state are divided on how to proceed.

In late April, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp allowed gyms, hair salons, and some other businesses to open, and a week later, he lifted restrictions on most other businesses. The decisions came despite warnings from public health officials that lifting restrictions too soon could cause the number of coronavirus cases to increase drastically.

But for hair salon owner Melissa Singleton, the reversal was welcome news.

""I don't feel like it's too soon,"" Singleton, owner of Melissa's Salon and Spa in Blairsville, told Business Insider Today. ""The economy has got to keep functioning, and we can't just sit back on our heels and wait for the government to supply all of our needs. That's not how America was built and that's not how it's going to survive.""

In the first weekend after Georgia businesses reopened, the state saw 60,000 more out-of-state visitors, mostly from neighboring states that are still shut down.

Singleton works alone in her salon, and only sees one customer at a time. The rural county where she lives and works has had 36 confirmed coronavirus cases as of May 15.

""I check each and every person that comes in for their temperature to make sure they don't have a temperature when they arrive here,"" she said. ""I take measures to wipe down the chairs, any chairs that they've come in contact with, all the door handles, the bathrooms — everything gets cleaned and sanitized after every customer.""

Meanwhile, in Atlanta, Brandi Shelton isn't planning on opening her tea shop any time soon.

""This is not ideal. I want to be open,"" Shelton, co-owner of the Just Add Honey Tea Company, told Business Insider Today. ""We want to service our customers and our community, but we also want to do it responsibly and not because of an arbitrary date.""

As states continue to reopen, business owners across the US will soon be facing similar decisions.",real

""Friends and family who know I work in toilet paper never wanted to talk about that before,"" Noble, who has overseen Georgia-Pacific's Angel Soft brand for four years, tells CNBC Make It.

But by early March of this year, when panicked consumers began frantically stock-piling toilet paper causing shortages, he was all of a sudden the most popular guy in the room.

Examples of the warning posts, shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook, can be found here , here , and here .

“Unfortunately, scam artists are using the coronavirus pandemic to try to steal Medicare numbers and other personal data,” a CMS representative told Reuters by email. “These schemes include fraudulent offers, usually in the form of unsolicited telemarketing calls, for free COVID-19 testing and protective equipment including respiratory masks, with no intent of delivery.”

As reported by the Washington Post, the new coronavirus has “spawned a swarm of scam robocalls seeking to prey on Americans’ fears,” with fraudsters placing an estimated 1 million calls a day about the coronavirus to Americans’ smartphones. According to the Post, such scams intend “to swindle and harm Americans at their most vulnerable — including the elderly, who might be most at risk of developing severe illness” ( here ).

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers advice for avoiding coronavirus scams, warning Americans to “be wary of ads for test kits” and “hang up on robocalls” ( here ). The U.S. Justice Department has also issued a fraud alert ( www.justice.gov/coronavirus ). Attorney General William Barr wrote in a message to U.S. attorneys: “The pandemic is dangerous enough without wrongdoers seeking to profit from public panic and this sort of conduct cannot be tolerated” ( here ). To report COVID-19 fraud, the Justice Department advises the public to call 866-720-5721 or visit its complaint form, Justice.gov/DisasterComplaintForm .

“If a beneficiary receives any unsolicited telemarketing calls, know that it is likely a scam to obtain a beneficiary’s personal information,” the CMS spokesperson told Reuters. The official directed beneficiaries not to provide their Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security numbers, and to be cautious about any unsolicited requests for personal information. Beneficiaries who notice suspicious activity on his or her quarterly Medicare Summary Notice should call 1-800-MEDICARE to report it.

The official told Reuters that the CMS is working with the Department of Justice, the FTC and other federal and state law enforcement authorities to actively monitor the effects of potential scams associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

VERDICT

True. Unsolicited phone calls purportedly from the Office for Medicare & Medicaid Services offering free coronavirus test kits and asking for social security numbers come from fraudsters.

The company joins other carmakers like Tesla and General Motors in helping out the medical community, after idling their automotive plants due to the effects the pandemic is having on both consumer demand and the global supply chain.

It all comes at a crucial time. As more people become infected with the novel coronavirus, there’s an increased need for protective equipment like masks to keep health care workers safe and ventilators to treat people with the worst symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Many places are still in short supply of both. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that help from the private sector won’t be enough, as he asked the federal government once again to intervene.

The need for masks and ventilators keeps increasing

Ford says it’s helping to increase 3M’s total output of “powered air-purifying respirator” (PAPR) masks, and the two companies are also coming up with a new design based on off-the-shelf parts “to go as fast as possible.” Ford says the new design could leverage fans from its F-150 truck’s cooled seats as well as HEPA air filters and portable battery packs for power tools that are already made by 3M. The automaker says it’s still trying to figure out how and where to build these “new-generation PAPRs.” But Ford believes it could potentially help 3M boost production of the masks “tenfold.”

In addition to that, Ford is working with GE’s health care division to figure out how to help the company make a “simplified version” of its ventilators. Ford says these ventilators “could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location,” but it did not go into any further detail. Ventilators are already in short supply and will continue to be as the virus spreads and more people develop acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.

Ford is also making and testing new face shields to help medical professionals mitigate the risk of becoming infected with the novel coronavirus, which can be spread by tiny droplets in a person’s cough or sneeze.

Many of the United States’ most recognizable companies have joined the effort to help reinforce the country’s increasingly stressed medical care system. Automakers are leading the charge in some ways by getting involved in sourcing supplies and evaluating ways to speed up the production of the most desperately needed equipment, like masks and ventilators. But spinning up medical equipment manufacturing operations is likely to take a lot longer than people like President Trump have made it seem, regardless of whether he invokes the Defense Production Act.

General Motors announced on Friday that it was partnering with ventilator manufacturer Ventec Life Systems and offering the company help with manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing issues to increase its output.

Tesla was able to buy what CEO Elon Musk said were surplus ventilators from China. The company handed more than 1,000 of them over to the state of California on Monday. Musk and Tesla also sent some 50,000 3M-made N95 surgical masks to the University of Washington’s Medical Center.

Other companies like Apple and Facebook are also donating hundreds of thousands of masks to health care workers across the country.",real

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”

Caracas has said that the National Armed Forces will provide military protection to the Iranian vessels to make sure they reach Venezuela accordingly. Socialist lawmakers say the government should defend the country’s sovereignty by any means necessary.

But on the opposition side, lawmakers have warned against any confrontation with the US military.

Meanwhile, experts say international law gives the right to Venezuela to receive aid from Iran or other countries.

Cuomo acknowledges wishing he ""blew the bugle"" earlier, but he's also placing misplaced blame on the media, which he incorrectly said wasn't reporting on the crisis as it unfolded.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has become the face of coronavirus competence in government, but he's a big part of the reason the crisis in New York grew to such devastating proportions.

The New York governor's star has shone brightly during the pandemic, especially in contrast to New York's tone-deaf and perpetually annoyed Mayor Bill de Blasio, who despite living in a publicly owned mansion in the middle of a spacious park insists on conducting nonessential travel to Brooklyn to walk around a park he likes better.

Compared with President Donald Trump, who says he takes ""no responsibility"" for the pandemic and treats his own public-health briefings as quasi campaign rallies, Cuomo is Winston Churchill.

Cuomo's daily briefings are sober but empathetic. He lays out the hard facts and gloomy predictions, yet he doesn't sensationalize. He presents himself as the adult in the room, in command of the situation and working hard for his constituents.

At a moment when a leader is needed, Cuomo seems born for the moment. It's a great story, but it leaves out some crucial details.

Cuomo gets to play hero in part because of his own mistakes

Cuomo conceded in an interview with Axios this week that he wished he ""blew the bugle"" on the coming crisis sooner. He also made a fair point that when ""China said basically, it was under control, don't worry, we should've worried.""

But then Cuomo came to bring the misplaced blame and revisionist history.

""Where was The New York Times, where was The Wall Street Journal, where was all the bugle blowers who should say, 'Be careful, there's a virus in China that may be in the United States?'"" Cuomo asked during an interview with Axios this week.

Well, actually, The New York Times wrote 450 stories on the novel coronavirus between January 9 and March 1, according to its metro editor.

On January 30, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 an international public-health emergency. On February 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Americans to prepare for widespread infections.

Meanwhile, on March 2, Cuomo said: ""Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers, I speak for the mayor also on this one, we think we have the best healthcare system on the planet right here in New York. So, when you're saying what happened in other countries versus what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries. We are fully coordinated, we are fully mobilized.""

New York was not fully coordinated, nor was it fully mobilized.

Testing was slow. Nonprofit social-service agencies that serve the most vulnerable couldn't get answers either. And medical experts like the former CDC director Tom Frieden said ""so many deaths could have been prevented"" had New York issued its stay-at-home order just ""days earlier"" than it did.

On March 19, when New York's schools had already been closed, Cuomo said ""in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.""

True enough, and we'll be debating for a long time whether the near-total national lockdown and subsequent economic ruin achieved the stated goal of mitigating the damage in lives lost better than alternative options might have.

But even with New York's stay-at-home orders, the city and surrounding counties' healthcare systems quickly became overwhelmed to the point that citizens were receiving text messages from the government telling them not to call 911 unless they had a life-threatening emergency.

Cuomo's petty fights with Bill de Blasio are not helpful

Cuomo's rivalry with his fellow Democrat de Blasio is well-documented. But repeatedly pulling rank on the mayor in public has sent mixed messages to a besieged state and city.

When de Blasio wanted to close New York City's schools, which arguably happened way too late, Cuomo said it wasn't de Blasio's decision. But then they closed anyway. Cuomo initially undercut de Blasio when the mayor said city schools might stay closed until September. But that now seems likely, too.

When de Blasio said New Yorkers should prepare to shelter in place, which was already happening on the West Coast, Cuomo again cut him off at the heels.

And most recently, when de Blasio said beaches might have to be closed throughout the summer, Cuomo said any such decision would have to be done in coordination with neighboring states.

This isn't to say Cuomo's pushback on de Blasio's proposals are inherently incorrect. It's more that a truly effective leader would work this all out behind the scenes and not in front of an exceptionally anxious public in need of clear guidance on how they're allowed to live their lives during a crisis with no end in sight.

Cuomo has spent years waiting for his hero turn, as exemplified by his well-publicized penchant for assisting car-wreck victims despite the advice of first responders that passersby should refrain from doing so unless the car is on fire.

Now that Cuomo is, like Rudy Giuliani post-9/11, the heroic face of government competence, he ought to exercise some humility himself. Wishing he had blown the bugle is a good start, but claiming he was unaware of the crisis as it was unfolding is simply passing the buck.",real

Based on the $3 trillion HEROES Act that House Democrats have just unveiled, the answer is illegal aliens and criminals.

While the HEROES Act pretends to be about coronavirus relief, its focus is on immigration.

With over 20 million jobs lost in April, the HEROES Act goes to great lengths to make sure that millions of illegal aliens will still be able to keep their jobs, no matter how many Americans lose theirs.

Buried under the misleadingly titled, “Protections for Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers”, is a virtual blank check to keep illegal aliens from being deported. The HEROES Act’s definition of “critical infrastructure workers” covers cafeteria workers, warehouse janitors, and pet food delivery boys.

Anyone who works in virtually any field involving food in any way is a “critical infrastructure worker”. An illegal alien putting out mouse traps at any facility involving food from “wholesale to retail” is a critical worker. A vast array of call center workers and delivery people are covered. Even laundromat employees are critical infrastructure workers under the federal definition used by the HEROES Act.

The HEROES Act doesn’t just protect illegal aliens from deportation, but SEC. 191203 declares that “hiring” illegal aliens is not a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and that the aliens are “deemed to be in a period of deferred action and authorized for employment.”

Americans seeking jobs as essential workers will be forced to compete with newly legalized illegal aliens.

Even while tens of millions of Americans are out of work, Pelosi and the House Democrats are going to great lengths to protect the ability of employers to illegally hire illegal aliens while authorizing them to accept those jobs. And considering how Federal judges have defended DACA’s deferred action, this temporary deferral could effectively become a permanent amnesty for millions of illegals.

The HEROES Act is really a backdoor amnesty that will declare illegal aliens “heroes” for delivering pizza. And these heroes who delivered pizza and sprayed for roaches in a plant somewhere can’t be deported. Instead, they’re going to be honored and legalized while Americans lose their jobs, savings, and lives.

The HEROES Act may end up killing more Americans of employment age than the coronavirus will.

Pelosi’s boondoggle also extends visas for aliens already in this country, regardless of whether they’re “critical” workers or not, and ‘rolls over’ all the visas that weren’t issued during this time. The Democrats are determined not to miss a single chance to bring more of their voters into the United States.

The rollover provisions focus on chain migration via “family-sponsored immigrants”, “employment-based immigrants” and “diversity immigrants”. All of these are aspects of a broken immigration system.

SEC. 191204 or “Supplementing the COVID Response Workforce” expedites processing applications for aliens who “provide healthcare” within 30 days by email. Visa applications can be bypassed with video-conferencing, and interviews are waived. This could allow for bringing Syrian Islamic “health care workers” to this country with virtually no oversight or screening even though the shortage of personnel that is driving this strategy has never actually come into being and American workers are being furloughed at hospitals and medical centers that were prevented from performing most procedures.

American health care workers furloughed because of the lockdown may end up losing their jobs because the Democrats who praise them as “heroes” insist on bringing in foreign workers to take their place.

And these foreign health care workers are being brought in under the broad umbrella of “preventing COVID-19”. If we didn’t have open borders on the ground and in the air, there wouldn’t have been a Wuhan Virus to prevent. But even while claiming to fight a pandemic caused by a foreign virus, Pelosi and the Democrats want more immigration and more open borders to spread more pandemics.

SEC. 191205 seeks to free illegal aliens already in ICE custody with a review of “the immigration files of all individuals in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assess the need for continued detention” to free those who are “not subject to mandatory detention laws.”

The section also demands that illegal aliens get free video chats, email access, and orders that pro-illegal alien lefty groups be given “broad and flexible access” to illegals.

But the HEROES Act doesn’t just settle for freeing illegal aliens, not when it can also free criminals.

The Dem bill seeks to free “vulnerable and low-risk individuals” in pre-trial detention. The definition of “vulnerable” is any prisoner over who is over 50 or under 18 who has, sickle-cell anemia, or asthma.

And how do Pelosi and her ilk define “low-risk”?

Any criminal who “does not pose a risk of serious, imminent injury to a reasonably identifiable person”.

That covers criminals who pose a risk of serious, imminent injury to any random member of the public.

Criminals who pose a risk of serious, but not imminent injury, criminals who pose a risk of imminent, but not serious injury, and criminals who pose a serious, imminent risk of injury to someone who can’t be reasonably identified, could all be considered “low-risk” by the jailbreaking HEROES Act.

Under these parameters, an asthmatic serial killer ought to be considered low-risk because we can’t identify whom he might chop to bits. A paranoid schizophrenic who only seriously assaults people when he goes off his medication could be considered to pose a risk of serious, but not imminent injury.

And, of course, muggers who don’t seriously hurt their victims would be considered low-risk. Ditto for car thieves, burglars, assorted robbers, and any felon who isn’t walking around with a sign reading, “I will kill Andrew next Tuesday”. And even then, we might not be “reasonably” sure which Andrew he means.

These are the heroes of Pelosi’s HEROES Act.

There’s also money for “safe and sanitary temporary transitional housing” and facilitating “family reunification” for the released criminals. And a push for applying “all pre- and post-adjudication release processes and mechanisms applicable to juveniles… as quickly as possible”.

That would cover 17-year-old offenders.

Pelosi and her Democrat allies claim to be very concerned about inmates in custody contracting the coronavirus. And yet after months of this, the predicted mass death tolls in prisons haven’t happened. Instead the elderly have been dying in large numbers in nursing homes. If the Democrats were really concerned, they would cut off funding to any municipality arresting people over social distancing.

But the Dems seem happy with a state of affairs in which citizens are arrested and criminals are freed.

The HEROES Act contains plenty that is bad, including a waiver of the Buy American Act that is a free gift to the People’s Republic of China, but its obsession with criminals and illegal aliens, at the expense of Americans, shows who Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats think that they’re really in office to serve.

While Americans are put out of work, the Democrats help illegal aliens hang on to their jobs. And while Americans are locked up for trying to cut hair, go for a walk, or play catch, criminals are set free.

The Democrat coronatopia is a place where criminals are free and everyone else is in prison, and where only government officials and illegal aliens have jobs.

We asked, Chicagoans answered.","With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you’ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won’t be for a while.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We’re now in Phase 2.

So with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what’s the first meal you’ll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

It’s part of a series of initiatives launched by JK Rowling and friends to keep everyone entertained while they’re cooped up at home. Better yet, it’s the version narrated by Stephen Fry, which has previously been difficult to legally access in the US.

As well as making the audiobook available, the series’ publishers are also temporarily relaxing licencing restrictions to allow teachers to read the books to their students in remote video lessons.

There are big debates about whether Stephen Fry’s or Jim Dale’s rendition of the audiobooks are better, but as a Brit who grew up listening to Fry’s version it’s always been the obvious choice for me. If you’re an American who’s never heard it then I’d recommend you giving it a go even if, as TechCrunch notes, you might have a difficult job getting your hands on his recordings of the rest of the books.

As well as Fry’s English version, the free audiobook is also available in Spanish, French, Italian, German and Japanese.

Teachers are also now free to stream themselves reading the books for students

Although Rowling and her team have loosened the licensing restrictions on teachers reading the books as part of remote virtual lessons, there are still some caveats. The biggest of these is that it’s meant to allow the books to be read on closed educational platforms like Google Classroom or Schoology, rather than commercial platforms like YouTube. Teachers are also encouraged to not amend or abridge the books while they’re reading them, which is advice that Rowling herself could occasionally stand to pay a little more attention to.

Meanwhile, if you’d like to listen to the audiobook, then you can do so over at stories.audible.com. Unfortunately the offer is streaming only (with no option to download), so you’ll need to make sure you’ve got a somewhat stable connection to the internet during its nine and a half hour runtime.

There's never been a virus like it.

""This gets into every major biological process in our cells,"" said Nevan J. Krogan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied HIV, Ebola, Zika, dengue and other viruses over the past 13 years.

""At the molecular level, it's something we've never seen before, and then look at what it does to the body – the long list of symptoms – we've never seen that before.""

As Americans debate the reopening of businesses, bars, schools and other aspects of everyday life, it's important to understand the virus we are up against and why it has sown so much suffering and confusion.

At first, the virus was thought to be mostly a risk to older adults and people with chronic illnesses; its primary point of attack, the lungs. Then 30- and 40-years-olds with the virus began dying of strokes. Recently, a small number of infected children have died of a mysterious illness resembling Kawasaki disease.

'Like a war':Pfizer head of vaccines talks finding a treatment for coronavirus

Symptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, coughing and shortness of breath to the loss of smell and taste and the angry red swelling that has come to be known as ""COVID toes."" Studies have found that damage from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, isn't limited to the lungs; it can include the heart, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal system and bowels.

To understand a virus' ""motivation"" – why it does what it does – keep in mind that it is a parasite. It lives inside its human or animal host taking what it needs at the expense of the host.

As long as it finds hosts without immunity, and as long as its own mutations do not weaken its ability to spread and multiply, the virus thrives.

Key benchmarks of a virus are how widely it spreads and how deadly it is to those it infects.

In the five months since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 4.5 million people across the globe, killing more than 300,000.

""The thing that strikes me about the clinical aspect is the shear amount of transmissibility,"" said Megan Freeman, a virologist and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.

""There are very few viruses that are more contagious than this one,"" agreed Mark Schleiss, an investigator for the Institute of Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.

A single COVID-19 patient spreads the disease to a median of 5.7 people, making it twice as contagious as the 1918 Spanish flu, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

A death crisis in New Jersey:How one mortician races to keep up with COVID-19

The rate of infection in the U.S. – what experts are referring to when they talk about ""flattening the curve"" – has slowed. Even so, the nation is still averaging about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths a day, roughly twice the number of deaths from 9/11 every week.

Thousands of the world's best scientists have worked with remarkable speed seeking to understand the new coronavirus. They deciphered its genetic code in barely a week and have produced scores of papers suggesting possible treatments and vaccines.

""The canvas we call COVID-19 was blank 16 weeks ago,"" said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. ""We've filled in a lot of dots, but we have so much more to go.""

""We don't understand HIV that well in my opinion,"" Krogan said, ""and we've been studying that for decades.""

Seeking the Achilles' heel of the virus

Scientists know some but not all of the reasons the new coronavirus spreads so easily. Freeman points to several factors, including one that distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from the virus it closely resembles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

SARS attacks the lower respiratory system, whose job it is to pull in air from the upper respiratory system.

SARS-CoV-2, however, attacks the upper respiratory system, the pathway that allows air to travel in and out of the lungs as we breathe. The upper airway is also the system involved when we cough.

The upper respiratory system offers a more efficient means of spreading, Freeman said.

""That's why it is more transmissible. ... When this emerged probably there was some mutation that adapted it to use the upper airway, and the upper airway has made it very successful.""

A second difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 involves the bond that allows viral cells to attach to human cells and infect them. With both viruses, this bond forms between the Spike Protein on the virus and a region on the outside of the human cell called the ACE-2 receptor.

Both viruses use this bond to enter cells, but the bond is much stronger with the new coronavirus than it was with SARS. That is why many of the potential treatments so far are designed to undermine that bond.

""You always want to target the Achilles' heel of the virus, something the virus does not have the luxury of changing too much"" explained Maria Elena Bottazzi, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-developer of a potential SARS vaccine that is going to be tested on SARS-CoV-2.

Although public health leaders compared the new coronavirus to seasonal flu early on, coronaviruses have a special feature that separates them from other viruses like flu. They have their own proofreading system that helps limit mistakes in their genetic code known as mutations.

""Flu viruses make six and a half times more mistakes than coronaviruses do,"" Freeman said.

Even as the spread of the virus slows in the United States, some researchers fear what will happen if major outbreaks hit poorer, densely populated cities in Africa.

""Look at the problems we've had,"" Poland warned. ""Now amplify that through areas that have civil wars, that have corruption, that have scarce resources. That's a humanitarian disaster in the making.""

A remarkable destroyer

The virus' skill at spreading poses one challenge; what it does inside the human body poses another.

Much of what scientists have learned so far about the new coronavirus suggests that it is a remarkable destroyer at both the micro and macro levels, decimating individual cells and entire organs.

At the molecular level, the virus disrupts some of the most fundamental functions of life: cell division; the system cells use to talk with one another; and their ability to make proteins.

The proteins our bodies make help us carry out almost every human action from eating and walking to breathing and thinking.

Once a person ingests the new coronavirus, it enters the lungs and directly infects the air sacs, the microscopic workhorses that take in the air we breathe. In serious cases, the air sacs fill with fluid, leaving less and less room for oxygen. This is a feature of what is known as COVID-19 pneumonia.

The pneumonia can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe breathing condition that deprives the vital organs of oxygen.

A healthy blood oxygen level is usually between 95% and 100%. Below 90% is low. Some COVID-19 patients have been found to have blood oxygen levels below 65%.

As the air sacs are infected and damaged, this triggers the immune system, which can lead to a dangerous condition called a cytokine storm. In a cytokine storm, the immune system goes into overdrive and winds up killing both healthy and diseased cells.

One of the most subtle and deadly offshoots of low blood oxygen is a condition called silent hypoxia.

As described by emergency room doctor Richard Levitan in a commentary in The New York Times, silent hypoxia allows patients to develop low blood oxygen levels without realizing the problem until it dips into dangerous territory. They breathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygen but are unaware they are breathing faster.

Levitan suggested that people can bypass long waits for coronavirus tests, using a simple device called a pulse oximeter as an early warning system for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. The device, which fits over your finger, measures blood oxygen levels, and can be bought at pharmacies without prescription for about $30.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 does not restrict its damage to the lungs.

The virus also causes blood clots, which have led to people in their 30s and 40s dying from strokes.

And then there are the recent cases in New York and Paris of children with COVID-19 who develop symptoms closely resembling Kawasaki disease. The disease begins with a rash and fever, inflames blood vessels, and eventually can damage the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart.

""What is it about COVID-19 that it produces Kawasaki disease?"" said Schleiss, at the University of Minnesota, who estimates he has seen more than 1,000 Kawasaki cases in his medical career.

""I don't think SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of Kawasaki disease, but it is the cause of something very similar.""

Every few weeks, SARS-CoV-2 seems to reveal new and disturbing oddities.

A recent study from China published in the journal JAMA Network Open, reported finding the new coronavirus in the semen of six of 38 infected men, raising concern that it may be possible to transmit the virus through sexual contact.

The virus also has been found in patient stool samples and untreated wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that standard methods at wastewater treatment plants should be effective enough to protect workers.

Such discoveries, however, raise fundamental questions, as we try to return to our old lives. Have we yet determined all of the ways the virus can spread from one person to another? Are there activities that may pose risks we have not anticipated?

At the University of California, San Francisco, Krogan said it will be important to examine the genetic scripts of both those who suffer severe cases of COVID-19 and those who get mild or no disease at all.

""There are 30-year-olds and some of them are asymptomatic and others are on respirators. What the hell is that all about?""

937,98,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-terms-glossary.html,2020-03-18,From Flattening the Curve to Pandemic: A Coronavirus Glossary,"
When is an epidemic considered a pandemic, and what is the difference? What do health officials mean when they recommend “self-quarantining” or “social distancing”?
As the coronavirus spreads around the world, new terms are entering the lexicon — and we’re here to help. Here’s a guide to the words and phrases you need to know to keep informed of the latest developments.
PandemicLast week, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic after it spread across six continents and more than 100 countries. A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease that affects large numbers of people. The W.H.O. had avoided using the word before Wednesday because it didn’t want to give the impression that the disease was unstoppable.
“Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., said at a news conference.
Covid-19The technical name for the coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory disease it causes has been named the “coronavirus disease 2019,” or Covid-19.
Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling the sun’s corona. Coronaviruses are among a large number of viruses that are common in people and many animals. The new virus, first detected in China, is believed to have originated in bats.
While antibiotics don’t work against viruses, researchers are testing drugs that could disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.
Flattening the curveThe term refers to a curve in a chart that shows when a surge of new coronavirus cases are expected to strike and illustrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it.
An illustration by the visual-data journalist Rosamund Pearce, based on a graphic in a C.D.C. paper titled, “Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza,” showed what Drew Harris, a population health analyst at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, called two epi curves.
The high curve showed a peak indicating a wave of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time.
Slowing and spreading out the tidal wave of cases will save lives.State of emergencyA state of emergency can be declared during natural disasters, epidemics and other public health emergencies. Declaring a state of emergency, as more than a dozen states — including New York, New Jersey and Michigan — have done, gives government officials the authority to take extra measures to protect the public, such as suspending regulations or reallocating funds to mitigate the spread of a disease.
Read more about those powers here.
Social distancingThe virus can easily spread in dense places — in a packed subway car, for example, or at a rally or concert.
Social distancing refers to measures that are taken to increase the physical space between people to slow the spread of the virus. Examples include working from home, school closings and the postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings, such as the South by Southwest music, technology and film conference.
By maintaining a distance of six feet from others when possible, people may limit the spread of the virus.
Self-quarantineThis is key to keeping the virus from spreading, along with measures like social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing masks.
While isolation refers to separating sick people from people who aren’t sick, quarantine refers to the separation and restriction of movement of people who were exposed to the virus to see if they become sick.
Who should self-quarantine? If you’ve left an area with widespread or continuing transmission, including China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, you should self-quarantine at home for a period of 14 days from the time you left, according to the C.D.C.
While in quarantine, you shouldn’t receive any visitors and must stay three to six feet from others at all times.
According to the C.D.C., once someone has been in isolation for 14 days and hasn’t become ill, he or she is not considered to be a risk to other people.
IncubationThe incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected. This time can be critical for prevention and control, and it allows health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus.
The new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days, according to the C.D.C., with symptoms appearing about five days after infection in most cases.
During the incubation period, people may shed infectious virus particles before they exhibit symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus.
Fatality rateThe case fatality rate is the number of deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases. Eventually, scientists hope to have a more comprehensive number called the infection fatality rate, which includes everyone who was infected with the virus.
The W.H.O. estimates the fatality rate of the new coronavirus to be about 3 percent, based on current data, but experts suggest 1 percent is more realistic.
R-naughtThe R-naught, or R0, is a virus’s basic reproductive number — an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness of infectious agents.
At its simplest, the basic reproductive number can show us how worried we should be about infection, according to Dr. Adam Kucharski, a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. If the R0 is above one, each case is expected to infect at least one other person on average, and the virus is likely to keep spreading. If it’s less than one, a group of infected people are less likely to spread the infection.
Research is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people.
ContainmentThe virus’s high transmission rate has made it difficult to effectively contain the outbreak. Containment refers to the use of any available tools to mitigate the spread of a disease, said Adam Ratner, the director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health.
Early on, the Trump administration sought to slow the spread of the virus by barring entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. While that measure may have bought the government time to prepare, the administration made key missteps in its efforts to make widespread testing available in the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.
Dr. Ratner says the coronavirus is particularly hard to contain because it is “reasonably transmissible,” and some people who don’t have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus to others. “That’s been part of the problem,” he said, “but it also points to the fact to how interconnected we all are and how quickly this thing spread from Asia to the rest of the world.”",real
942,810,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/magazine/didier-raoult-hydroxychloroquine.html,2020-05-12,He Was a Science Star. Then He Promoted a Questionable Cure for Covid-19.,"
When diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions — that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. “Hubris,” Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, “is the most common thing in the world.” It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. “Someone who doesn’t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,” he said. “Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.”
Raoult, who founded and directs the research hospital known as the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, or IHU, has made a great career assailing orthodoxy, in both word and practice. “There’s nothing I like more than blowing up a theory that’s been so nicely established,” he once said. He has a reputation for bluster but also for a certain creativity. He looks where no one else cares to, with methods no one else is using, and finds things. In just the past 10 years, he has helped identify nearly 500 novel species of human-borne bacteria, about one-fifth of all those named and described. Until recently, he was perhaps best known as the discoverer of the first giant virus, a microbe that, in his opinion, suggests that viruses ought to be considered a fourth and separate domain of living things. The discovery helped win him the Grand Prix Inserm, one of France’s top scientific prizes. It also led him to believe that the tree of life suggested by Darwinian evolution is “entirely false,” he told me, and that Darwin himself “wrote nothing but inanities.” He detests consensus and comity; he believes that science, and life, ought to be a fight.
It is in this spirit that, over the objections of his peers, and no doubt because of them, too, he has promoted a combination of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and azithromycin, a common antibiotic, as a remedy for Covid-19. He has taken to declaring, “We know how to cure the disease.” Trump was not the only one eager to embrace this possibility. By the time I arrived in Marseille, some version of Raoult’s treatment regimen had been authorized for testing or use in France, Italy, China, India and numerous other countries. One in every five registered drug trials in the world was testing hydroxychloroquine.
In March, Raoult announced that his hospital would test and treat anyone who cared to show up. Crowds gathered at the entrance to the IHU in winding single-file lines, like pilgrims shuffling toward their private audience with the oracle. On March 16, Raoult released the results of a small clinical trial that showed, he said, a 100 percent cure rate. The study has since been widely debated, and Raoult’s boosterism has been lamented by scientists and health officials around the world; in a comment more or less representative of the tenor of the controversy in France, where Raoult’s name and image have now been everywhere for weeks, one detractor, a generally thoughtful politician, suggested that Raoult “shut his face and be a doctor” and that he “stop saying ‘I’m a genius’ all over the place.”
His colleagues liken his psychology to that of Napoleon, though he is not physically small. When asked by one journalist about his tendency to “swim against the current” of scientific thought, Raoult responded: “I’m not an ‘outsider.’ I’m the one who’s farthest out in front.” Axel Kahn, a geneticist and physician who has known Raoult for nearly 40 years, told me that he has always been this way. “One of Professor Raoult’s abiding characteristics is that he knows that he’s very good,” Kahn told me. “But he considers everyone else to be worthless. And he always has. It’s not a recent development.” At his home, alongside a collection of Roman busts, he is said to keep a marble statue of himself.
Raoult, who is 68, is a sturdily built but fine-featured man, with high cheekbones and a tight, contemptuous mouth. In recent years, he has hidden these behind a straggly white mustache and goatee and has grown his flaxen hair down to his shoulders. On his right pinkie he now wears a silver skull. In internet memes, he has been depicted as the wizard Gandalf and as a druid; except for his white lab coat, he has the general aspect of a fortuneteller who rides a Harley to work. The French journalist Hervé Vaudoit, who has written admiringly about Raoult over the years, once asked him why he’d taken to dressing this way. Raoult replied, “Because it pisses them off.”
In the weeks since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spread throughout the world, his disdain for respectable opinion, and for the “Parisian marquesses” who are its representatives, has endeared him to a large segment of the French population. According to one survey, by late March, Raoult had become one of France’s most popular “political personalities,” with particular appeal on the populist extremes. Votives bearing his image were being sold in Marseille, and on some evenings, at 8 p.m., a battalion of municipal garbage trucks assembled on the roadway outside his hospital, where the drivers leaned on their horns in loud and furious tribute. A hundred-foot banner, painted by a club of local soccer fans and strung up near the entrance, read, “Marseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!”
Raoult has been collecting the merchandise created by his fans, and he seems to be enjoying his fame, though he claims otherwise. He is certain the drugs will vindicate him in the end; everything else is a matter of appearances. “I really do think we’re in a theater,” he told me. “In my play, the people who judge me as a doctor are my patients. As a scientist, it’s my colleagues. And time.”
A few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille’s old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another — they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door — they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. “In any case, we’re all going to get it,” the nurse said.
I crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. “It’s getting better,” Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. “There’s no ‘believing’ or ‘not believing,’” Cohen replied. “We know it’s effective!”
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are well characterized, well tolerated and widely prescribed medications. Azithromycin was developed 40 years ago in the former Yugoslavia and is today the second-most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Hydroxychloroquine, along with its more toxic analog chloroquine, was for several decades the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug in the world. Today it is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. All three molecules are included on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, a compilation of “the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions.”
Raoult knows the drugs well. From the start of his career, he has experimented extensively with drug repositioning, in which medicines that have been approved for use against one disease are repurposed as treatments for others. Hundreds and hundreds of molecules have already been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. Hidden among these, Raoult contends, are various unanticipated cures. “You test everything,” Raoult told me. “You stop pondering; you just look and see if, by chance, something works. And what you find by chance, it’ll knock you on your derrière.” Antidepressants and antihypertensives have been shown to have antiviral properties; lovastatin, which is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, has been found to be effective, at least in mice, against plague. In a 2018 paper, Raoult and a team of researchers reported that azithromycin showed strong activity in cells infected with the Zika virus.
Raoult spent the first decade of his life in Dakar, in what was then French Senegal, where his father, a military doctor, was posted. To ward off malaria, he was given chloroquine. “I took it all the time when I was a kid,” he told me. In the 1990s, in an early repurposing experiment, he tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine on a frequently fatal condition known as Q fever, which is caused by an intracellular bacterium. Like viruses, intracellular bacteria multiply within the cells of their hosts; Raoult found that hydroxychloroquine, by reducing acidity within the host cells, slowed bacterial growth. He began treating Q fever with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline and later used the same drugs for Whipple’s disease, another fatal condition caused by an intracellular bacterium. The combination is now considered to be a standard treatment for both diseases.
Given the similarities between intracellular bacteria and viruses, Raoult suspected that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have antiviral effects. Following the SARS outbreak in 2002, researchers found that chloroquine slowed reproduction of the SARS coronavirus in cell cultures. Raoult reviewed that evidence in a 2007 paper, concluding that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be “an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.” This winter, as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began to take on the contours of a pandemic, he surveyed the data that had begun coming out of China. An early report on chloroquine showed good results in vitro. In mid-February, another Chinese team reported that, in more than 100 patients, it had been found to have “potent activity against Covid-19.” Raoult was elated.
At the time, health authorities around the world were warning that a viable treatment could be months away. The Chinese reports, however, appeared to confirm Raoult’s longstanding hopes for chloroquine. A deadly virus for which no treatment existed could evidently be stopped by an inexpensive, widely studied, pre-existing molecule, and one that Raoult knew well. A more heedful scientist might have surveyed the Chinese data and begun preparations for tests of his own. Raoult did this, but he also posted a brief, jubilant video on YouTube, under the title “Coronavirus: Game Over!” Chloroquine had produced what he called “spectacular improvements” in the Chinese patients. “It’s excellent news — this is probably the easiest respiratory infection to treat of all,” Raoult said. “The only thing I’ll tell you is, be careful: Soon the pharmacies won’t have any chloroquine left!”
Raoult has spent nearly his entire life in Marseille, a famously ragged and combative city, which he loves. He named a genus of bacteria, Massilia, for it and has given its name or the names of its neighborhoods to numerous other species of microbe. Marseille has been a major port for more than 2,000 years and has a correspondingly rich history of disease. It was the point of entry into France for all three of the great waves of bubonic plague, beginning in the sixth century. Between 1720 and 1722, the plague killed about half of Marseille’s population; one of its central neighborhoods, on the old port, is today named for the bishop who tended to the ill while the city’s doctors hid in fear.
Raoult wrote his first research paper, in 1979, on a tick-borne infection sometimes known as Marseille fever. The disease was also called “benign summer fever,” and more than 50 years of science said it was nonlethal. And yet one of the 41 patients in his data set had died. Before submitting the paper, Raoult, who was then a young resident, gave it to a supervising professor for review. “And he takes it,” Raoult told me, “he doesn’t show it to me again, and he publishes it — and he’d taken out the death. Because he didn’t know how to make sense of the death.” Raoult was disgusted, and the incident shaped his philosophy of scientific inquiry. “I learned that the people who wanted to follow the familiar path were prepared to cheat in order to do it,” he said. In subsequent work, he demonstrated that Marseille fever was indeed fatal in almost precisely one in every 41 cases. “He was a ‘follower,’” Raoult said of the professor. “And these ‘followers’ are all cheaters. That’s what I thought. And it’s still what I think.”
He is, fundamentally, a contrarian. In Raoult’s view, little of consequence has been accomplished by researchers who endorse the habitual tools and theories of their age. “I’ve spent my life being ‘against,’” he told me. “I tell young scientists: ‘You know, you don’t need a brain to agree. All you need is a spinal cord.’” He is thrilled by conflict. It is a matter both of philosophy — the influence, no doubt, of the thinker he refers to admiringly as “master Nietzsche” — and of temperament. “He loves to know that things are roiling around him,” one of his lab technicians told me; he sets off storms and admires them as they roll out over the land. His peers shake their heads at this behavior but grant him a grudging respect. “You can’t knock him down,” said Mark Pallen, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia. “In terms of his place in the canon, the sainthood of science, he’s pretty secure there.”
He is also interested in power and has been attentive to it from the start. In 1985 and 1986, Raoult worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he discovered the Science Citation Index. The index, a tool that can be used to measure a scientist’s influence on the basis of his or her publication history, was relatively unknown in France. Raoult looked up the researchers reputed to be the best in Marseille. “It was really the emperor wears no clothes,” he said. “These people didn’t publish. There was one who hadn’t written a paper in 10 years.” In Raoult’s view, French science was a duchy of appearances, connections and self-reverence. “It was people saying” — he mimed the drone of an aristocrat — “ ‘Oh, him, yes, he’s very good.’ And this reputation, you don’t know what it’s based on, but it’s not the truth.”
For decades, Raoult has boasted of his prodigious rates of publication and citation, which, as objective statistics, he considers to be the best measure of his worth as a researcher. Biomedical researchers in France write or contribute to perhaps 10 scientific papers every year and a few hundred in the course of a career. Raoult’s name sits atop several thousand; in each of the past eight years, he has produced more than 100. In 2020, he has already published at least 54.
Raoult is reputed to be an indefatigable worker, but he also achieves his extreme rate of publication by attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute. Though the practice is not unheard-of, it is unusual. “Even to just read those papers would take up a large percentage of anyone’s time,” Pallen told me. “For someone like me to actually go through them carefully, critique them, make a substantial intellectual contribution — I think that would be practically impossible.”
With few exceptions, the department heads at the IHU have worked under Raoult for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. It is an “ancestral system,” “familial” and “clanlike,” said Michel Drancourt, a clinician who is Raoult’s longest-serving collaborator. Raoult is, without question, the patriarch, and he is in some respects reputed to be benevolent. The IHU spends a great deal of money on scholarships and research grants for students from the developing world, for instance, and Raoult is known to be accessible to young researchers in a way that distinguishes him from other high-powered scientists. He is also known for berating his subordinates. While visiting the IHU, I watched a young researcher emerge from Raoult’s office in tears and rush into the arms of her friends, who were evidently accustomed to this. “When he’s not happy about something, he’ll let you know,” one of them told me. A 2017 employee letter of complaint, which was followed by an investigation of the IHU, described the “screaming,” “insults” and “psychological bullying” of a “leadership of another era.” Along the entryway to Raoult’s institute, there’s a line from Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius, “I have crafted a monument more lasting than bronze.”
In recent years, Raoult has amused himself, it seems, by staking out tendentious scientific claims, sometimes in territories that are well beyond the scope of his expertise. He is skeptical, for instance, of the utility of mathematical modeling in the realm of epidemiology. The same logic has led him to conclude that climate modelers are no more than “soothsayers” for our “scientistic era” and that their dire predictions are mostly just an attempt to expiate our intense but irrational feelings of guilt.
He is also dismissive of the alarmism that is the default position among specialists of infectious disease. He doubted, initially, that SARS-CoV-2 would spread beyond China, or that it might be a terrible problem if it did. On Jan. 20, Chinese scientists confirmed that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient, and President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments about the coronavirus, declared that all possible measures would have to be taken to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting. The following day, in Marseille, Raoult posted a video to his institute’s YouTube channel. He faced his offscreen interviewer with weary eyes, sighed and said, “You know, the world has gone crazy.” Every year, he said, there are probably 600 or 700 people who die from coronavirus infections in France and thousands more from other respiratory illnesses. “The fact that people have died from a coronavirus in China, I don’t feel like it means much of anything for me,” he said. “I don’t know, maybe people don’t have anything to do, so they’ve gone looking in China for something to be scared about.”
Raoult’s most recent book, “Epidemics: Real Dangers and False Alerts,” was published in late March, by which time the W.H.O. had reported more than 330,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and more than 14,500 deaths. “This anguish over epidemics,” he writes, “is completely untethered from the reality of deaths from infectious diseases.”
By the standards of molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, the technology most commonly used to test for SARS-CoV-2, is not extravagantly complex. But it depends upon collection swabs, thermocycling machines, chemical reagents and nucleotide probes and primers, and if any one of these components is in insufficient supply, the tests cannot be run. Beginning in January, when the SARS-CoV-2 genome was first published, the IHU bought or borrowed as much of all these as possible, spending a half million euros on new machines alone. Whatever Raoult’s reservations about the virus, he did not intend to miss the opportunity to study it, and perhaps to win the race to find a treatment. His institute receives most of its funding from public sources — Raoult was given 130 million euros to build it — but it effectively controls its own budget, and Raoult, as the founding director, has near-complete control of what goes on inside its walls. “He can essentially say, ‘Hold on, I want to turn the bedroom and the dining room into a kitchen,’” Drancourt said.
Nearly 800 people work at the institute. In early March, as coronavirus patients began arriving, almost all the staff members turned their efforts to SARS-CoV-2. Raoult obtained authorization to begin a small clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine. Because viral respiratory infections often lead to secondary bacterial infections, however, Raoult wanted to test a supplementary antibiotic in some patients; he chose azithromycin, which he had previously tested against Zika. “If you’re going to choose one, you might as well choose one that’s been shown to be active against a virus,” said Bernard La Scola, who runs the biosafety lab at the IHU.
Hydroxychloroquine is believed to inhibit viral reproduction in infected cells by raising their pH, as in Q fever and Whipple’s disease; the antiviral mechanism of azithromycin has not been explained. But what works works. If we relied only upon medications with precisely established mechanisms, a number of popular drugs — acetaminophen, for instance, the active ingredient in Tylenol — would not be in use. I asked Raoult if the idea to test the drugs together had emerged from discussions with his team. “It was me,” he told me. “Don’t kid yourself.”
Testing had been scheduled to run for two weeks per patient, but after only six days, the results were so favorable that Raoult decided to end the trial and publish. “Usually, we’d take time to write, to make corrections, to consider, to go over things 50 times,” said Philippe Gautret, the department head who was the first listed author on the paper. “In this case, we were working with a sense of real urgency. Because we thought we had to get the word out, because, maybe, we’d found a way to make things better.”
Others might have proceeded with more caution or perhaps waited to confirm these results with a larger, more rigorous trial. Raoult likes to think of himself as a doctor first, however, with a moral obligation to treat his patients that supersedes any desire to produce reliable data. “We’re not going to tell someone, ‘Listen, today’s not your lucky day, you’re getting the placebo, you’re going to be dying,’” he told me. He believes it to be unnecessary, in addition to being unethical, to run randomized controlled trials, or R.C.T.s, of treatments for deadly infectious diseases. If these have become the accepted standard in biomedical research, Raoult contends, it is only because they appeal to statisticians “who have never seen a patient.” He refers to these scientists disdainfully as “methodologists.”
Raoult’s paper included results for 36 patients. Fourteen were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate; six were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and azithromycin; and 16 served as controls. On Day 6 of the trial, 14 of the 16 control patients still tested positive for the virus. Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine fared markedly better, with only six of 14 testing positive on Day 6. Most encouraging, though, all six patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found to be rid of the virus.
Several prominent French doctors cautioned that the results would have to be confirmed and warned of possible side effects. The French health minister deemed the trial promising but called for more testing. Raoult had already begun assembling data for a larger study, but he dismissed the need for anything particularly vast or lengthy. Like other critics of the R.C.T., he likes to point out that a number of self-evidently useful developments in the realm of human health have never been validated by such rigorous tests. This observation has come to be known as the parachute paradigm: We tend to accept the claim that parachutes reduce injury among people who leap from airplanes, but this effect has never been proved in a randomized study that compares an experimental parachute group to an unlucky parachuteless control. “It’s like Didier says,” Drancourt told me. “If you don’t have something that’s visible in 10 patients, or 30, it’s useless. It’s not of any consequence.” An effective treatment for a potentially lethal infectious disease will be visible to the naked eye.
On March 16, a Long Island attorney and blockchain enthusiast named Gregory Rigano appeared on Laura Ingraham’s nightly show on Fox News, “The Ingraham Angle.” Ingraham introduced the segment by asking: “What if there’s already a cheap and widely available medication, that’s on the market, to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It’s called chloroquine.” Rigano, who at the time was falsely presenting himself as an adviser to Stanford Medical School, had recently self-published an acclamatory report on the potential of chloroquine, “An Effective Treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19),” as a Google Doc formatted to resemble a scientific publication. It had begun to circulate in right-wing media and also in Silicon Valley; Elon Musk tweeted a link to it. Raoult saw it and noticed the attention it was receiving online. Another researcher might have found this sort of publication irresponsible and dangerous. Raoult began corresponding with Rigano and his co-author, James Todaro, an ophthalmologist and Bitcoin investor. Raoult authorized them to share his results before they had been published.
On air, Rigano announced that a researcher in the south of France, “one of the most eminent infectious-disease specialists in the whole world,” was about to publish the results of a major clinical study. “Within a matter of six days, the patients taking hydroxychloroquine tested negative for coronavirus, for Covid-19,” Rigano said. (He made no mention of azithromycin.) “We have a strong reason to believe that a preventative dose of hydroxychloroquine is going to prevent the virus from attaching to the body, and just get rid of it completely,” he added. “That’s a game changer,” Ingraham said.
In the coming days, Ingraham questioned both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Trump’s pandemic task force, and Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, about the drug. Sean Hannity began promoting it as a cure for Covid-19. “Let’s put it this way,” he said on his radio show. “If I had it — personally, I am speaking only for Sean Hannity — I would be all over this.” Rigano appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and claimed that Raoult’s study had shown hydroxychloroquine to have a “100 percent cure rate against coronavirus.” According to Todaro, Raoult had sent him a copy of his study and allowed him to post it on Twitter that day, two days before the preprint release. “I suspect he gave us permission because he knew it was the fastest way to disseminate the trial results,” Todaro told me. (Rigano did not respond to requests for comment.) Later, Raoult himself appeared on “Dr. Oz,” the talk show hosted by the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a frequent Fox News guest who has promoted hydroxychloroquine. “I believe that ideas and theories are epidemic,” Raoult once wrote. “When they’re good, they take root.”
Trump began hyping hydroxychloroquine on March 19, at a White House news conference with his coronavirus task force. “I think it’s going to be very exciting,” Trump said. “I think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful.” He suggested, inaccurately, that the F.D.A. had approved the drug for use against Covid-19. He made no mention of azithromycin. Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn of the F.D.A. gently corrected him later and said that a large clinical trial would be the appropriate way to evaluate the therapeutic value of the drug.
Still, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are available for use in other conditions, doctors were able to provide Covid-19 patients with “off-label” treatment if they believed it would provide a benefit. Shortages of the drugs were reported beginning in mid-March. The F.D.A., under what appears to have been strong pressure from the Trump administration, issued an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, giving doctors access to tens of millions of doses of the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile. Unusually, the C.D.C., at what was reportedly Trump’s direct urging, issued Covid-19 prescription guidelines for the drugs based upon unattributed clinical anecdotes. (The guidelines were later withdrawn.) A top government biomedical official was removed from his post, he has claimed, for having resisted political pressure to fund “potentially dangerous drugs,” including hydroxychloroquine.
There is much about Raoult that might make him, and by extension his proposed treatment, appealing to a man like Trump. He is an iconoclast with funny hair; he thinks almost everyone else is stupid, especially those who are typically regarded as smart; he is beloved by the angry and conspiracy-minded; his self-congratulation is more or less unceasing. Raoult and I spoke several days after the emergency-use authorization was signed. He said he hadn’t heard about it and seemed surprised, but he also said that Trump had impressed him with his intuition on hydroxychloroquine. “He’s not so dumb,” he said, laughing. Raoult classified Trump’s psychology as that of an “entrepreneur,” by way of contrast with that of a “politician.” “Entrepreneurs are people who know how to decide, who know how to take risks,” he said. “And at a certain point, to decide is to take a risk. Every decision is a risk.”
The French waited far too long, in his estimation, to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients. The authorization came only after Raoult announced in the press that he would continue, “in accordance with the Hippocratic oath” and effectively in defiance of the government, to treat patients with his combination therapy. “I’m convinced that in the end, everyone will be using this treatment,” Raoult told Le Parisien. “It’s just a matter of time before people agree to eat their hats.”
The dynamics of a crisis are not especially conducive to reliable science. In October 1985, in the terrible early years of the AIDS epidemic, a group of French doctors, joined by the French minister of social affairs, held a news conference to announce to the world that they had discovered what looked like a cure. The drug was cyclosporine, an inexpensive immunosuppressant that had until then been used in organ transplants to prevent the rejection of new tissue. In AIDS patients, cyclosporine had the paradoxical effect of increasing white-blood-cell counts; patients underwent a “spectacular improvement,” one researcher said. The announcement was based upon results from only two patients, however, and these patients had begun treatment only one week earlier. The scientists were widely criticized at the time for flouting the norms of biomedical research to report such limited data. “Given the strength of our hypotheses,” they responded, “we believe that, ethically, we could not continue to keep our results a secret just to respect the usual laws of scientific conduct.”
“Like Raoult, they felt very strongly about what they said,” said Jean-Michel Molina, who directs the infectious-disease departments at two public hospitals in Paris. “They felt that they had found a cure.” Shortly after the announcement, one of the two patients died, and it was revealed that a third patient had died before the news conference; he had been excluded from the reported results because his case was considered too grave to reverse. Within weeks, the remaining patient’s white-blood-cell count had fallen to its previous level. Experimentation with cyclosporine soon stopped.
Like many doctors, Molina viewed Raoult’s study with skepticism, but he was also curious to see if his proposed treatment regimen might in fact work. He tested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 of his own patients. “We had severe patients, and we wanted to try something,” Molina told me. Within five days, one had died, and two others had been transferred out of his service to intensive care. In another patient, the treatment was suspended after the onset of cardiac issues, a known side effect of the drugs. Eight of the 10 surviving patients still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the conclusion of the study period. Raoult’s data had come from patients with mild or early cases of the disease, when viral loads are lower, and I asked Molina if his patients had not been too sick to benefit from the treatment. “If there is antiviral activity, you should be able to see it,” he said. “You know, you may say, ‘It’s too late, you’re not going to see the clinical benefit.’ But at least you should see the antiviral activity. If it’s an antiviral.”
Raoult’s study had measured only viral load. It offered no data on clinical outcomes, and it was not clear if the patients’ actual symptoms had improved or indeed whether the patients lived or died. At the outset, 26 patients were assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine, six more than the 20 who appeared in the final results. The six additional patients had been “lost in follow-up,” the authors wrote, “because of early cessation of treatment.” The reasons given were concerning. One patient stopped taking the drug after developing nausea. Three patients had to be transferred out of the institute to intensive care. One patient died. (Another patient elected to leave the hospital before the end of the treatment cycle.) “So four of the 26 treated patients were actually not recovering at all,” noted Elisabeth Bik, a scientific consultant who wrote a widely circulated blog post on Raoult’s study. She paraphrased the sarcasm circulating on Twitter: “My results always look amazing if I leave out the patients who died.”
The report was also riddled with discrepancies and apparent errors. Its selection criteria called for participants above the age of 12, but three of the control subjects were younger than this. The control patients were drawn not only from the IHU but also from hospitals in two other cities, where the standard of care and the testing protocols may have differed. Fourteen of 16 control patients were reported to have tested positive for the virus at the conclusion of the study on Day 6. In fact, according to the initial report, for five of those 14, no data was collected that day. One of the six patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and was recorded as “virologically cured” at Day 6 was found, in the end, to be carrying the virus two days later.
This apparent sloppiness was unsurprising to many of those who have tracked Raoult’s work in the past. A prominent French microbiologist told me that, in terms of publication, Raoult’s reputation among scientists has been “long gone” for some time. “In private,” the researcher wrote to me, “everybody agrees on the low reliability/reproducibility of most of the papers coming out of his lab.” (He asked to speak anonymously so as not to anger Raoult, whom he knows.) In 2018, after damning evaluations, Raoult’s principal laboratory groups were stripped of their association with two of France’s top public research institutions. Raoult was found to have produced an extraordinary number of publications but few of great quality. “It’s very easy to publish [expletive] when you know how publishing works,” said Karine Lacombe, a professor of medicine in Paris who has recently been among Raoult’s more outspoken critics.
Beyond its apparent errors and omissions, the study’s design — its small size, its flawed control, the unrandomized assignment of patients to the treatment and control groups — was widely viewed to render its results meaningless. Fauci repeatedly called its results “anecdotal”; the biostatistician who analyzed the paper on behalf of the French government’s coronavirus advisory committee wrote that it was “impossible to interpret the effect described therein as being attributable to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.”
Large, well-controlled randomized trials are by no means the only way to arrive at useful scientific insights. Their utility is that they enhance statistical signals such that, amid the noise of human variability and random chance, even the faint effect of some new treatment can be detected. The prime statistical hurdle that any proposed treatment for Covid-19 will have to overcome — one that is delicate for even Raoult’s critics to make note of, amid the sorrow and fear of this pandemic — is that the signal is likely to be very faint, because the disease is, in the end, rarely fatal. Nearly everyone survives; an effective treatment will save the life of the one or so patients in every hundred who would not have lived without it. “You know, people sometimes say, ‘If the patient gets better, that’s because of the drug, and if they get worse, it’s because of the virus,’” Molina told me. “And of course that’s not true. And that’s why you need to do a well-conducted, randomized, placebo-controlled study if you want to show anything.” It is possible that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are an effective treatment for Covid-19. But Raoult’s study showed, at best, that 20 people who would almost certainly have survived without any treatment at all also survived for six days while taking the drugs Raoult prescribed.
“If you haven’t done this stuff, you can look at a report of people responding to such a treatment and ﬁgure that the answer is here — right here, and anyone who doesn’t see it must have some ulterior motives,” Derek Lowe, a longtime pharmaceutical researcher, wrote for Science Translational Medicine last month. “But that’s not how it works.” He went on: “Alzheimer’s drugs, obesity drugs, cardiovascular drugs, osteoporosis drugs: Over and over, there have been what looked like positive results that evaporated on closer inspection. After you’ve experienced this a few times, you take the lesson to heart that the only way to be sure about these things is to run sufﬁciently powered controlled trials. No shortcuts, no gut feelings — just data.”
“I’ve invented 10 or so treatments in my life,” Raoult told me. “Half of them are prescribed all over the world. I’ve never done a double-blind study in my life, never. Never! Never done anything randomized, either.” He noted, with some satisfaction, that the criticism was more intense than he had anticipated. “Honestly, I couldn’t have imagined that it would set off a frenzy like this,” he said, leaning back in his office chair and gesturing at the storm he had created in the world outside. “When you tell the story, it’s extremely straightforward, no? It’s subject, verb, complement: You detect a disease; there’s a drug that’s cheap, whose safety we know all about because there’s two billion people who take it; we prescribe it, and it changes what it changes. It might not be a miracle product, but it’s better than doing nothing, no?”
His subordinates defended the study as the best work they could do under the circumstances and the fastest way to alert the world to the possibility of a treatment. The use of off-site controls was not ideal, for example, but it was the only option if they wanted to move fast. “Of course it’s a methodological weakness,” Gautret, the first author, told me. “But we made do with what we had.” As for the six patients “lost in follow-up,” even if it had been possible to collect data from them, it would have been nonsensical to include most of them in their report. Their aim was “to treat people in the early stages of the disease, when it’s not yet serious,” Gautret said. “We know that in acute viral diseases, the earlier you treat, the better your chances of success. It makes no sense to include people who are at the edge of death in the study. We’re not claiming to be able to treat people who are nearly dead.” Another small study, in 80 patients, likewise showed better results for patients with mild forms of the disease.
In Marseille, Raoult told me he would be releasing a third study, this one of 1,000 patients, the following week. Initial results were published in mid-April. Raoult had treated 1,061 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The study was neither controlled nor randomized; at the time of the preprint release, eight patients had died, and five remained hospitalized, while 46 in total experienced a “poor clinical outcome.” The findings were summarized as “98.7 percent of patients cured so far.” The therapy constituted a “safe and efficient treatment for Covid-19,” the authors wrote.
Other scientists disagreed with this characterization of the results. “The cure rate is almost identical to what’s been described about the natural course of the disease,” the virologist Christine Rouzioux told French radio. Lacombe called Raoult’s conclusions “magical thinking,” adding: “I very honestly think he hasn’t shown anything at all.” It was soon discovered, too, that the second and third studies had been conducted without approval from a state ethics board. In an initial version of the third paper, Raoult wrote that he had conducted a “retrospective study on a cohort of patients receiving standard treatment following a research protocol previously registered.” He provided a reference to the protocol that had been approved for the first trial. But that protocol included hydroxychloroquine alone and not azithromycin; Raoult never received approval to systematically test a combination of the drugs.
The French medical regulatory agency, the A.N.S.M., sent Raoult a request for evidence of the second study’s “legal status” in mid-April. Later in the month, the French Medical Council issued a statement, widely assumed to be directed at Raoult, reminding its members that “the endangerment of patients” by exposure to “treatments that have not been scientifically validated” could be cause for immediate suspension. Raoult responded on Twitter, where he now has a half million followers, that the council’s threat was “obviously” not applicable to his case. In a statement on the A.N.S.M.’s inquiry, the IHU insisted that the study did not involve experimentation because “no procedure beyond the standard of care” — which, at the IHU, was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — had been employed.
Raoult had by then begun to lose his composure. He accused Lacombe of being a shill for the pharmaceutical industry; his fans sent her death threats. On Twitter, he called Bik, the consultant who wrote critically about the first study, a “witch hunter” and called a study that she tweeted — one of several published in April and May that seemed to suggest that Raoult’s treatment regimen was ineffectual or even harmful — “fake news.” The authors of another such study were accused of “scientific fraud.” “My detractors are children!” Raoult told an interviewer. The world’s attention has drifted to new studies of other drugs; Raoult has taken to attacking those studies for their methodological weaknesses.
The results of his initial trial have yet to be replicated. “I think what he secretly hopes is that no one will ever be able to show anything,” Molina told me. “That all the trials conducted on hydroxychloroquine will not be able to even reach a conclusion of no efficacy.” In recent weeks, Raoult has in fact tempered his claims about the virtues of his treatment regimen. The published, peer-reviewed version of the final study noted that another two patients had died, bringing the total to 10. Where the earlier version called the drugs “safe and efficient,” they were now described merely as “safe.”
He has shown flickers of what appears to be doubt. In one interview, Raoult quoted Camus, from the fatalistic coda of “The Stranger,” hoping that “on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators, and that they should greet me with howls of hatred.”
“I don’t trust popularity,” he told the interviewer. “When too many people think you’re wonderful, you should start to wonder.” His initial YouTube video, “Coronavirus: Game Over!” has also been renamed. The new language is more measured, and in place of the exclamation point there now stands a question mark.",real

Press TV, Tehran



With this prayer, Muslims bid farewell to the fasting month of Ramadan and welcome one of the major festivities in Islam, Eid al-Fitr, or the festival of breaking the fast.

This year, however, the rows of the congregational prayers are arranged differently, with worshipers observing the safety distance amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Eid al-Fitr is associated with family visits, public celebrations and spending more time with the elderly.

Such traditions are mostly avoided this year, but there are other ways to catch up with relatives.

Eid al-Fitr is a culmination of one month of abstinence from eating and drinking, that's why Muslims consider it a reward for their month-long self-discipline and control over their diet.

Eid al-Fitr falls on the first day of the lunar month of Shawwal. The announcement of the festivity depends on the sighting of the new moon. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and some other countries observed the Eid a day earlier.

This year, Muslims marked the most different Eid al-Fitr with the novel coronavirus outbreak preventing family visits and public celebrations. However, these people say the darkest hour is just before the dawn, and distances today will bring about happier reunion tomorrow.",fake

“Over the weekend, we unfortunately had two more Blue Origin employees test positive for the COVID-19 virus,” Mary Plunkett, the senior director of organizational development at Blue Origin, wrote in an email, referencing another employee who had been confirmed on Friday. The two new confirmed cases are a married couple who work at Blue Origin’s headquarters in Kent, Washington. One was last in the office as early as Friday, April 3rd, while the other had last been in the office on March 27th, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday.

“Over the weekend, we unfortunately had two more Blue Origin employees test positive.”

Blue Origin says its human resources team will keep in contact with the employees, and the company has conducted a “thorough deep cleaning” of the places visited by the individuals. The company stressed to employees that they should stay home if they are sick. An email sent out on Friday told employees: “As a reminder, public health officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consider being in the same indoor environment, such as a conference room or factory, as a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 as being a low risk for infection.”

The news of the cases comes after The Verge revealed that employees at Blue Origin have raised concerns about conducting a test launch of the company’s New Shepard rocket, designed to take paying customers to the edge of space and back. Conducting the test would require transporting employees from Washington to rural Texas. In a meeting with employees, Blue Origin management suggested that there might be employment repercussions if people didn’t travel for the launch. In response to The Verge’s report, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told employees in an email that the company would, in fact, be hiring amid the pandemic and not conducting layoffs.",real

UNITED STATES

There are no government-imposed measures in the United States, though all major U.S. airlines require face coverings and several are capping the number of seats sold or leaving middle seats empty. Many airports are also requiring face coverings. Major U.S. airlines have also endorsed temperature checks at airports by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, which so far has implemented safety measures such as increased spacing in security checkpoint queues.

EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITED KINGDOM

The European Commission last week proposed airlines and airports require passengers to wear masks, and reorganise check-ins, dropoffs and luggage pickups to avoid crowds. Travellers should keep luggage and movement in the cabin to a minimum. The guidelines are not binding, but they may help form a framework in the bloc as restrictions are lifted. The United Kingdom is observing E.U. trade and travel regulations until the end of 2020.

CHINA

The aviation regulator is requiring extra ventilation and sterilisation of airplanes and airports. Passengers are required to fill out an electronic health declaration before boarding and are asked to sit apart from each other onboard if possible. Temperature checks are required for every passenger and workers like cabin crew and security officers are offered protective gear. Passengers need to wear a mask throughout the flight.

JAPAN

The government has directed airlines to make in-flight announcements about health measures and to distribute health information cards and questionnaires. It has also asked airport staff to wear masks, but they are not mandatory for passengers. There is no requirement to keep the middle seat empty.

SOUTH KOREA

The aviation regulator is requiring travellers’ temperatures be checked in the airport. Airport authorities ask travellers to stand at least 1 metre (3 ft) apart in line, and are furnished with hand sanitiser. Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS) is seating passengers as far apart as possible, conducting additional temperature checks on international travellers and requiring all domestic passengers to wear masks, with a few exceptions such as children under 2 years.

QATAR

At the airport, staff and passengers are required to pass temperature checks and disinfection procedures, with high contact areas disinfected every 10 to 15 minutes. Qatar Airways is encouraging social distancing on board when possible, especially on flights with lighter loads, and will require passengers to wear masks.

MALAYSIA

The government is requiring airlines carry a maximum of half the usual number of passengers on board, with some exceptions on flights between peninsular Malaysia and states in Borneo. At the airport, passengers must remain 1 metre apart from each other for social distancing, including markers in queues. Malaysia Airlines requires passengers to wear masks onboard.

INDONESIA

Airlines can only carry half the usual number of passengers as part of government requirements to leave 1 metre between them. Air crew are required to take the temperature of passengers 30 minutes before landing. Passengers must wear masks and fill in a health awareness card.

THAILAND

The aviation regulator requires airlines to leave at least one seat empty between passengers, who are required to wear surgical masks onboard. No food and beverages will be served during flights and passengers are not allowed to eat or drink. In an event of emergency, the cabin crew may provide water.

PHILIPPINES

The government requires passengers to wear masks upon entering the airport, mandatory temperature checks and for social distancing measures to be observed at queuing points. Security screenings should be done with minimal contact. Passengers need to fill out an electronic health declaration form.",real
957,1100,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/coronavirus-senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to-boost-nonprofit-workforce.html,2020-05-15,Senate Democrats introduce bill to boost nonprofit workforce as coronavirus crushes resources,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) speaks during a campaign rally at the Altria Theatre on February 29, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

A group of Senate Democrats introduced legislation Friday to provide grants to nonprofits to bolster hiring efforts as their resources dwindle amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, is meant to equip nonprofits with a strong workforce that can continue to provide essential services to vulnerable Americans.

Nonprofits will be able to apply directly for the grants through the Treasury Department, according to a press release from Klobuchar's office announcing the bill, which is called WORK NOW, or the Work Opportunities and Resources to Keep Nonprofit Organizations Well Act. The hope is the grants will allow nonprofits to retain their workforce or provide jobs for newly unemployed people.

Since government lockdowns began, nonprofits and institutions catering to vulnerable populations like domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters and food banks, have seen steep declines in volunteers and revenue. At the same time, these nonprofits are trying to adhere to social distancing guidelines as they grapple with ways to stay afloat.

In some cases, volunteer shortages have led to higher expenses to maintain the same levels of service.

About 72.5% of nonprofits surveyed said they've seen reduced contributions since the pandemic hit, according to a report released Thursday. The survey, conducted by the Charities Aid Foundation of America, asked about 880 nonprofits around the world to weigh in on how the coronavirus has affected them.

""Nonprofits are on the front lines of this crisis helping millions of Americans in need. From food banks, to shelters, to counseling centers, charitable organizations are doing incredible work to help families put food on their table, provide housing assistance, and serve people with disabilities,"" Klobuchar said in the release.

""But as demand for their services soars, many of these organizations are struggling financially. At the same time, over 36 million men and women have lost their jobs and are looking for work. We need to help charitable nonprofits keep their doors open, scale their invaluable services, and provide opportunities for unemployed men and women to return to work serving their communities.""

The WORK NOW Act is sponsored by Sens. Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.

The outbreak has spread to dozens of countries globally, with more than 4.4 million confirmed cases worldwide and over 302,493 deaths so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. There are at least 1.4 million cases in the United States and at least 85,906 deaths, according to the latest tallies.",real

This week, BI launched its ""What's Next"" package, in which we talked to more than 200 CEOs about how the coronavirus is going to change their company, industry, and the world. I spoke with Momofuku CEO Marguerite Mariscal about how the restaurant industry will be forced to evolve due to the pandemic. Mariscal told me:

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place. We are hopefully going to see a reform that will better position restaurants, even after there's a vaccine. The worst thing a restaurant can do is go back to 'normal.'""

Bethany talked with meal kit CEOs about how their companies are thriving during the pandemic. Andy Levitt, CEO of the plant-based meal kit company Purple Carrot, said:

""Meal kits were starting to fall out of favor and were less en vogue because of the rise of services like Instacart and Doordash. Meal kits have had a massive comeback in the last two months. Now we'll see how we can sustain that as things begin to normalize, if and when they do.""

Of course, we also talked to non-food-centric retail CEOs. (I was hungry when I was writing this newsletter.) AirBnb CEO Brian Chesky told Madeline:

""We used to do a lot of travel for work, and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse. I think we'll work more on screens and entertain ourselves in the real world.""

McDonald's workers are worried about catching the coronavirus on the job. Samantha Lee/Business Insider

I've been hearing from McDonald's employees about what it is like working at the chain during the pandemic over the last few months. At the same time, I've seen more news than ever before about workers' protests as part of the SEIU-backed Fight for 15 movement.

I pieced together what has been going down inside McDonald's, from worker unrest to tension with franchisees to new corporate policies.

McDonald's has already made major changes, including adding two weeks of paid sick leave for COVID-related cases and raising workers' pay. This week, news broke that McDonald's is beginning to allow franchisees to reopen stores, as well as offering additional financial support for marketing.

Read this story to understand what might permanently change for McDonald's workers.

Whole Foods is doubling down on online orders. Whole Foods

Hayley reports that more Whole Foods are being transformed into stores that exclusively fulfill online-only orders. A Chicago ""dark store"" that opened this week is the sixth Whole Foods location to shift to the format.

It is easier for dark stores to rapidly fill online orders since the grocery staff does not have to work cash registers or help customers. It also helps address workers' worries about catching the coronavirus from customers.

""By shifting to a 'dark' format, stores reduce the number of people entering the store, and therefore reduce overall exposures to employees,"" Hayley writes. ""Stores can also more easily enforce uniform safety standards, such as the usage of masks and gloves, among the people allowed inside.""

Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.

""The President has made it clear that we must continue to keep legitimate, commercial trade flowing while limiting those seeking to enter our country for non-essential purposes,"" Wolf wrote in a statement. ""Non-essential travel will not be permitted until this administration is convinced that doing so is safe and secure.""

He continued: ""We have been in contact with our Canadian and Mexican counterparts and they also agree that extending these restrictions is prudent at this time. We appreciate our partnership with Mexico and Canada in ensuring that North America is working together to combat the ongoing global pandemic.""

US-Canada border closure: What it means for travelers

Canada

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held a press conference, saying the extension of the closure was a mutual agreement between the United States and Canada.

""It was the right thing to further extend by 30 days our closure of the Canada-U.S. border to travelers other than essential services and goods, but we will continue to watch carefully what's happening elsewhere in the world and around us as we make decisions on next steps,"" Trudeau said Tuesday.

During the French portion of his address, he noted there had been a push from Canada's provinces to keep the restrictions intact for now because the border is a place of ""vulnerability,"" according to the Canadian Broadcasting Company's interpreter.

The U.S. and Canada first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after President Donald Trump and Trudeau agreed to close the border to help contain the spread of coronavirus. The State Department said that the order ""does not apply to air, rail, or sea travel at this time, but does apply to commuter rail and ferry travel.""

Trump tweeted March 18, ""We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected.""

The border's closure was then extended for an additional 30 days on April 18, with Trudeau explaining, “The agreement is the same terms. It’s just extended for another 30 days. It will ensure we continue to get essential goods and services back and forth across the border.""

Nearly 200,000 people cross the U.S.-Canada border daily in normal times.

“We will continue to take the measures necessary to keep Canadians safe while ensuring the continued flow of our essential supply chains on which so many Canadians depend,” Trudeau said in April.

Essential cross-border workers like health care professionals, airline crews and truck drivers will still be permitted to cross. Truck drivers are critical as they supply grocery stores and medical goods in both directions. Much of Canada’s food supply comes from or via the U.S.

Mexico

The U.S. and Mexico first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after Trump said the country agreed to close the border to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Like Canada, the US-Mexican border closure was extended multiple times.

Wolf said that essential travel, including medical purposes, to attend educational institutions, for emergency response/public health purposes and lawful cross-border trade, would not be effected by the border closure.

US-Mexico border closure:What does that mean for travelers

For tourists, Mexico is the seventh most-visited country around the world, according to Mexico tourism data, and 26 million U.S. travelers visited Mexico from January to August 2019, according to the U.S. National Travel and Tourism Office.

The Mexico-U.S. border has been a prominent and often contentious issue during Trump's tenure in the Oval Office. During his campaign ahead of the 2016 election, the ""build the wall"" movement, an effort to build a wall along the border to keep Mexican immigrants from entering the U.S., gained traction among his support base but stoked criticism among his detractors.

If world governments continue to demand cleaner technologies be used for their energy supplies, whether for highly efficient fossil fuel power plants or renewable sources, the world should expand the sources of critical minerals, including widening the resource base from a larger number of countries with minerals, and ensure timely investment in new mines, and, in countries where regulations are barriers to mining, reforming regulations to allow responsible mining.",fake

972,1836,https://theduran.com/quarter-of-americans-have-no-interest-in-taking-covid-vaccine/,2020-05-22,Quarter Of Americans Have No Interest In Taking COVID Vaccine,"Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people…

President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership to develop a vaccine and ready it for mass production by early 2021, has generated anti-vaccine concerns among some Americans, a new survey finds.

The survey, published via Reuters/Ipsos on Thursday, found 25% of Americans have no interest in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

About 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe. Only 14% said they would be interested.

Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 said they would need to review additional research on the vaccine to determine if it was safe.

A little less than 66% were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a vaccine if made readily available.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters, considering there are 92,000 virus-related deaths, he thought there would be a much higher amount of people that would want the vaccine.

“It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Schaffner. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The survey found 14% were not interested at all, 10% were not very interested, and 11% were unsure about subjecting themselves to a vaccine.

Health experts tell Reuters that, “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program aims to produce 300 million doses of a vaccine by January, a goal that we’ve said is widely unrealistic.

The president’s constant hype of vaccines has led some people to believe many of the drugs in development are being rushed and could have dangerous side effects. Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people.

Nearly 84% of respondents said vaccines for measles are safe, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the FDA approved it.

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where his staff is currently developing a vaccine, said:

“It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll underlines how political divides among Democrats and Republicans predate the pandemic, but lockdowns have since catalyzed new divides and exacerbating old ones. That being, nearly 20% of Republicans said they had no interest in a vaccine, which was more than double the proportion of Democrats who said the same.

With creepy billionaire Bill Gates and big government rushing vaccines into development and for possible mass production next year — the anti-vaccine movement in America continues to grow.

She says there are “a few good candidates” for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs “to start looking at a paid medical leave policy” to help workers on the front lines.

She also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis:

“We haven’t had leadership at the national level … it’s chaos.”

This while wearing a very odd looking upside-down inverted cross around her neck.

Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck.

Symbolism is very important to groups like the Illuminati, the New World Order and others, as they love to flash you signs of how much smarter they are than you and I are.

We are ruled by a satanic death cult who is obsessed with symbolism. Besides Melinda Gates’ inverted cross, here’s 2 more examples of satanic symbolism related to the ‘Gates of Hell’ family and the upcoming ‘mark of the beast’ vaccine:

1. An Enzyme Called LUCIFERASE is What Makes Bill Gates Implantable Vaccine Work

2. Microsoft Funds ID2020 And Files Patent For Device Attached To The Human Body For Buying And Selling Bitcoin – Patent #666

They like to put their true agenda right in our faces, and dare us to figure it out. Take a quick trip to our Predictive Programming section, and you will see immediately what we’re talking about.

All this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck.

Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood … you get the idea.

“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:” Galatians 3:13 (KJB)

The early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.

The cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.

The bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans / satanists do.

I will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.

I know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.

But when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.

The Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.

Over the years we’ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It’s also worth mentioning that the pope’s throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]

Occult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.

Andrea Bocelli, the superstar tenor, will livestream an Easter Sunday concert from Milan's famed Duomo cathedral. Just like practically every other church in the world, the pews will be empty, and Bocelli will be accompanied only by organist Emanuele Vianelli. The concert will stream live on Bocelli's YouTube channel on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.

Plenty of other artists have announced livestreams as venues shut down because of the spread of the coronavirus, but Bocelli's live concert from an empty Duomo — which is normally full for Easter Mass — will be one of the more striking examples of the extent to which the pandemic has altered public life.

The stream will not be the Italian tenor's first attempt to help out during the coronavirus crisis. Italy has been hit hard by the pandemic, and Bocelli's foundation has raised more than $140,000 via GoFundMe to help hospitals purchase supplies. He will also be part of Global Citizen's huge One World: Together At Home event on April 18.

In a statement released Tuesday, Bocelli said he hopes that the Easter concert, which will consist mostly of spiritual songs such as ""Ave Maria,"" will provide some comfort to viewers regardless of their religion.",real

Analysts say the experience of SARS has guided the Chinese military's prompt response, but combat effectiveness has still been affected.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

China's military may have been spared any coronavirus infections, but the global health crisis has slowed the progress of Chinese President Xi Jinping's plan to transform the People's Liberation Army into a modern fighting force capable of long-range power-projecting operations, experts say.

According to China's defence ministry, the world's largest armed force — with about 2.3 million personnel — has had zero confirmed cases of Covid-19. In contrast, the US and Russian militaries, ranked second- and third-largest in the world, have reported more than 4,000 and 1,000 respectively.

But the PLA has been affected in other ways by the disease, which was first reported in Wuhan in December before going on to infect 3.9 million people around the world to date.

Safety concerns delayed its annual spring recruitment programme — it has been rescheduled for August — while the PLA Navy was forced to change its training arrangements, switching to classroom study of military theory and tactics, according to Xinhua.

""The PLA is still a conscription army and, given its large turnover of soldiers every year and the late recruitment and training plan this year, the coronavirus pandemic has already affected combat effectiveness,"" said Adam Ni, director of the China Policy Centre, an independent, non-profit research organisation based in Canberra, Australia.

The navy's operations, in particular, would have been affected, according to Charlie Lyons Jones, a researcher from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's defence and strategy programme.

""The Chinese navy, short of highly effective disease control measures, is unlikely to avoid similar outbreaks of the novel coronavirus on board its warships,"" he said.

""Therefore, even if the PLA Navy currently has zero personnel infected by the novel coronavirus, its position as a navy that can operate effectively in a period of higher-than-normal tension remains precarious at best,"" Jones said. He also questioned Beijing's claims that the military was virus-free.

""The PLA played an important role in China's response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan … The idea that none of these personnel working on the front lines in Wuhan became infected by the novel coronavirus would be inconsistent with the experiences of countries from around the world,"" he said.

More than 4,000 military medical workers were sent to Wuhan as part of China's effort to contain the outbreak at ground zero — which included the rapid-built emergency field facility, the Huoshenshan hospital — and their efforts were highlighted in a documentary screened recently by state broadcaster CCTV.

At the time, rumours were rampant that the Chinese military had been affected by the coronavirus, fuelled by a report on February 17 by the official PLA Daily that some soldiers had been placed in quarantine and Yu Qiusong, captain of the Changzhou type 054A frigate, was isolating in a guest house. The news report did not mention why the personnel were in quarantine.

But analysts said that whether the official numbers were accurate, the PLA's closed management, fast response and past experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) gave China's military an advantage in keeping the coronavirus at bay.

Zhou Chenming, a Beijing-based military observer, said a key reason for the less serious hit to the PLA compared to other forces was its speed in recognising the severity of the situation.

""What's more, the PLA has its own logistic support system that can help minimise its contact with the outside world, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus,"" he said.

According to Xinhua, the PLA's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention drew up an emergency response plan and mobilisation arrangements on January 20, the same day Xi issued an instruction to the public that the virus must be ""resolutely contained.""

Timothy Heath, a senior international defence research analyst with the Rand Corporation, a US think tank, said China's military had benefited from its less international role, compared to US forces.

""The US is a globally distributed force while the Chinese military largely operates on the mainland. The US thus faces challenges in containing the disease that the Chinese military does not have to face … and the US military has a large range of missions and tasks it carries out to counter threats to its allies and partners, as well as to US security. This complicates efforts by the US military to carry out disease control measures,"" he said.",real

Because, while we are all desperate to get back to normal, normal is not good enough.

Normal is more than two million people behind bars and not nearly enough support for the formerly incarcerated trying to reenter society. Normal is a health care system that leaves millions of Americans uninsured and the rest of us paying more than any other country in the world. Normal is rising sea levels and a retreat from addressing climate change. Normal is a defense budget larger than the combined defense budgets of the next seven countries.

Opinion

Normal is millions of low-income students leaving school without the skills to get a job and millions of college graduates drowning in debt. Normal is a digital divide that denies millions of students and families the same access to technology most of us take for granted. Normal is 100,000 Americans injured or killed with guns each year and school children doing live shooter drills.

Normal is most working people living paycheck to paycheck and unable to cope with a $400 emergency. Normal is limited family leave and no support for child or elder care. Normal is rising substance abuse and declining life expectancy in communities from urban to rural.

Normal is 38 million American households paying too much for a roof overhead and half a million people sleeping on the streets every night. Normal is the top one percent of America having more wealth than the bottom 90 percent and CEO’s earning nearly 300 times more than their employees. Normal is billionaires paying a lower percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries.

Lawmakers in Washington just passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus that bails out existing companies and small businesses, helps the newly unemployed, and provides some support to state and local governments. There’s also money for the health care industry, checks for working families and the poor, and some relief from student loans.

While these needs are all real in this crisis, that $2.2 trillion of our money will do nothing to change the structural inequities in our society. As an African-American emergency room doctor in Chicago wrote, “To really address the issue of African American health risks in the age of corona virus, we need to acknowledge the root causes.”

Those root causes include racism and discrimination. They include disinvestment in inner-city communities. They include our broken politics that have paralyzed governments and our misguided tax and labor policies that have consolidated wealth and hollowed out the middle class.

As Congress considers additional measures needed to recover from the COVID crisis, let’s think a little harder about the world we want and need rather than the world we have. Let’s imagine a world where incarceration is a last resort rather than the default solution to crime. Let’s imagine a world where guns are kept from people who shouldn’t have them.

Let’s imagine a world where health care and housing are affordable and available to everyone, along with paid family leave, child care and elder care. Let’s imagine a world where on-line learning is accessible to every student who needs it.

Let’s imagine a world where science rather than politics drives our response to climate change. Let’s imagine a world where elected officials are held accountable for misleading us and where they are unable to rig elections with gerrymandering and voter suppression.

Finally, let’s imagine a world where there’s plenty of incentive to work hard and even get rich but there are some common-sense measures in place to ensure that a tiny few can’t capture an obscene amount of the nation’s wealth while the majority of Americans struggle.

In the world we can imagine, shared prosperity is possible by recommitting to the basic middle-class promise: a good job that can support a family, affordable housing, health care and education, and a dignified and secure retirement.

The COVID crisis will be with us for several more months, but the economic fallout will be with us for years, and the underlying inequities will be with us forever if we don’t do something about them. It’s time to seize the moment and create a new normal.

The changes are a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has made holding courtroom sessions unsafe, especially with six justices aged 65 or older and at risk of getting seriously sick from the virus.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

The historic session began at the usual time of 10 a.m. EDT, when Marshal Pamela Talkin called the court to order and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the day’s case.

“Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” Talkin began, dropping the words commanding people “to draw near” to reflect the unusual circumstances.

Arguments, scheduled to last an hour as they would generally in the courtroom, ran 17 minutes long, but without serious problems. The justices asked roughly two questions apiece at a time, and Roberts occasionally interjected to keep things moving.

And there was one mild surprise: Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions for the first time in more than a year.

Several justices said “good morning” to the lawyers, a telephone nicety not often heard in the courtroom. The justices also did not interrupt each other, as they frequently do in court, and instead took turns asking questions.

The court’s plaza, normally bustling on the mornings of arguments, was deserted Monday, as it has been since the building was closed to the public in mid-March because of the virus outbreak. Two months of arguments were postponed before the court decided to hear 10 cases over six days in May.

The experiment could propel the court to routinely livestream its arguments. Or it could just be an extraordinary exception to the court’s sustained opposition to broadening the audience that can hear, if not see, its work live.

Cases that will be heard over the next two weeks include President Donald Trump’s effort to shield tax and other financial records and whether presidential electors have to cast their Electoral College ballots for the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state.

The court chose a somewhat obscure case about whether the travel website Booking.com can trademark its name for its first foray into remote arguments. The lawyers on both sides are well known to the justices and experienced in arguing before the nation’s highest court.

Justice Department lawyer Erica Ross, who once served as a law clerk to Justice Elena Kagan, was first up. She last argued at the court in late February. She delivered this Supreme Court argument, her sixth, from a Justice Department conference room.

She was followed by Lisa Blatt, a onetime government lawyer who will be arguing her 40th Supreme Court case. Blatt will be at her Washington-area home, she told The Washington Post.

She is known for her colorful writing and speaking style and for her ability to engage in a healthy give and take with the justices. She was also a prominent liberal supporter of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court.

Blatt, representing Booking.com, got Justice Sonia Sotomayor to laugh out loud when she told the justice, “It looks like we would have lost if you were the trial judge.”

Each lawyer got two uninterrupted minutes to make an opening statement, after which Roberts kicked off the questioning. After that, the justices asked questions in order of seniority. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in 2018, went last.

The court sometimes issues opinions at the start of argument sessions, with the justice who wrote for the majority reading a summary of the opinion and, more rarely, a second justice summarizing a dissent. But in another change wrought by the virus outbreak, opinions are being posted online without any statements from justices. The court will next issue opinions on Thursday.

The session ended as it always does in the courtroom. Roberts said, “The case is submitted.”

Talkin followed: “The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o’clock.”",real

President Trump asked Americans during Monday's coronavirus briefing to maintain their social distancing through the end of the month to bring the coronavirus under control.

And if people really do observe the stay-at-home orders, models suggest that the epidemic could wane by summer. There's also hope that the changing weather will help slow the spread of the virus, though that's far from certain.

But there's a problem. Even if things ""get better all of a sudden,"" as the president suggested he hoped would happen, the virus will not have gone away.

""This virus is now in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of locations around the world,"" said Mark Denison, director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""And it's not finished with its human exploration.""

Not that the virus is intentionally exploring, it's just doing what viruses do: infecting cells and making copies of itself. That doesn't happen when enough people are immune from infection, either because people have been exposed to the virus, and recovered, or because they've been vaccinated.

Virologists call people who don't have that immunity ""naïve."" Their immune system hasn't learned how to deal with the threat the virus represents.

""This virus has about 8 billion immune-naive people on the planet,"" said Denison. He worries that the virus could easily flare up again once people start going back to work and restarting their accustomed activities.

""This thing is scaring the hell out of me,"" said Denison.

""When the virus is gone, people are going to sit next to each other,"" Trump said, at sporting events and restaurants. But that may be farther off than the president thinks.

The best protection against the virus would be a vaccine. But that's probably at least a year away, even if the crash development programs now underway succeed.

Still, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it may be possible to loosen societal restrictions sooner. ""I don't think that you're going to have to say that the country cannot get back to a real degree of normalcy until you absolutely have a safe and effective vaccine,"" he said during the briefing.

A test that measures people's antibodies, and presumably their immunity, to the virus will be available widely by May, according to U.S. Public Health Service Adm. Brett Giroir.

That kind of test will be ""so important,"" Fauci said, because then health officials will know how widely the virus has spread.

Broader testing capability, including antibody testing, would help the country reduce the kind of COVID-19 mitigation by social distancing that is in effect now. ""We will have in place the capability of identifying [cases], contact tracing and isolating so it never gets out of hand,"" he said.",real

“Six big lies you have been told about Russiagate” authored by Nebojsa Malic, via RT…

‘Russian meddling’ in the 2016 US presidential election has become an article of faith, not just among Democrats but many Republicans as well, thanks to the endless repetition of vague talking points, none of which hold water.

It all began with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) claiming in June 2016 that Russia hacked their computers, after documents were published revealing the party’s rigging of the primaries. This was followed by Hillary Clinton accusing her rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, of “colluding” with Russia by asking Moscow for her emails – the ones she deleted from a private server she used to conduct State Department business, that is.

With a little help from the mainstream media, which overwhelmingly endorsed Clinton and predicted her victory, her efforts to cover up her email scandal turned into Russia “hacking our democracy,” eventually spawning the ‘Russiagate’ investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a series of failed attempts to derail Trump’s election and oust him from the White House.

Lie #1: Russia hacked the DNC

The infamous US intelligence community assessment (ICA) of January 2017, and the Senate Intelligence Committee report based on it – as well as ‘analysis’ by actual election meddlers, among others – all claimed that the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin personally were behind the “hack” and publication of DNC documents. These have always been assertions, and no evidence was ever provided.

Last week’s declassification of 50+ interviews in the probe conducted by the House Intelligence Committee revealed that the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, brought in by the DNC lawyers to fix the “hack,” did not have evidence either.

CrowdStrike’s president, ex-FBI official Shawn Henry, testified that they “saw activity that we believed was consistent with activity we’d seen previously and had associated with the Russian Government.” [emphasis added]

In the same testimony, Henry also testified that CrowdStrike never had any evidence the data was actually “exfiltrated,” i.e. stolen from the DNC servers.

CrowdStrike’s feelings about the hack remain the only “evidence” so far, since the FBI never asked them or the DNC for the actual server, as Henry also confirmed. Meanwhile, former NSA official and whistleblower William Binney argued back in November 2017 that actual evidence showed a leak from the inside, not a hack.

Lie #2: Russia hacked Podesta’s emails and published them in collusion with WikiLeaks

There is likewise zero proof that the Russian government had anything to do with the private email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair, which a staffer admitted had been compromised when someone fell for a phishing scam.

Instead, the key argument that WikiLeaks was somehow ‘colluding’ with Russia over the publication of the emails rests on a conspiracy theory promoted by the Clinton campaign staff, after RT reported on a fresh batch of emails before WikiLeaks got around to tweeting about them – but after they were published on the website and available to anyone willing to do actual journalism.

In fact, the existence of RT has been a major “argument” of Russiagaters; a third of the ICA intended to show ‘Russian meddling’ consisted of a four-year-old appendix about RT that was in no way relevant to the 2016 situation but lamented its coverage of fracking and ‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests, for example.

Lie #3: The Steele ‘pee tape’ dossier was irrelevant

As it later emerged, Clinton’s claims about ‘Russian collusion’ were based on a dodgy dossier her campaign commissioned through the DNC and a firm called Fusion GPS from a British spy named Christopher Steele. It said that the Kremlin was blackmailing Trump with a tape of depraved sex acts in a Moscow hotel, with prostitutes supposedly paid to urinate on a bed President Barack Obama had slept on.

It was clearly ridiculous and entirely evidence-free. Democrats claimed it played no role in Russia investigations. Yet the FBI paid Steele for information from the dossier, and used it to justify a FISA warrant for the surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page – and with him the campaign itself – starting right before the election, and renewed three times.

By January 2020, the DOJ had formally disavowed the dossier and all four FISA warrants, along with any information obtained from them, saying “there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause.”

Lie #4: General Michael Flynn treasonously colluded with Russia and lied about it to the FBI

Trump’s first national security adviser was hounded out of the White House after less than two weeks on the job, after media leaks insinuated he had improperly discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, violating the Logan Act, and then lied to the FBI about it.

After FBI Director James Comey was fired by Trump in May 2017, he told the media the president had urged him to drop the investigation of Flynn, which was quickly construed as “obstruction” and used as one of the pretexts to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel into Russiagate.

When actual evidence was finally coaxed out of prosecutors, however, it showed that the FBI sought to frame Flynn in a perjury trap, and that the people involved were Comey himself, his deputy Andrew McCabe, disgraced lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and others. All charges against Flynn were dropped.

Flynn didn’t even lie to Strzok and the other agent interviewing him – and the memo of that conversation had been first heavily edited, then destroyed. Basically, everything about the Flynn case has been as false as ABC’s December 2017 bombshell report about his “collusion” with Russia that got Brian Ross fired.

Lie #5: Mueller found collusion, or at least Russian meddling

When Mueller’s final report came out, in the spring of 2019, it found zero evidence of “collusion” but insisted there had been Russian “meddling” in the election. The only trouble was that he had no proof of meddling, basing it entirely on the above-mentioned intelligence “assessments” and his own indictments.

A Russian company named in one of the indictments actually contested it in a US court and won. First, a federal judge slapped down Mueller’s prosecutors for violating rules by presenting allegations as “established” and “confirmed” facts and ruling that no link was actually established behind a catering company accused of “sowing discord” on social media – a far cry from hacking the DNC! – and the Russian government.

The DOJ quietly dropped that particular case in March, just as coronavirus shutdowns were starting across the US, using “recent events” and a change in classification of some of its evidence as a face-saving excuse.

Lie #6: Paul Manafort was Trump’s conduit to Russia

Paul Manafort, who ran Trump’s campaign between March and August 2016, was convicted of multiple counts of conspiracy against the US and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. However, despite repeated attempts by the media to present him as some kind of liaison between Trump and Russia, the entirety of things that got him in trouble with the law had to do with tax evasion on money he made lobbying for and in… Ukraine.

During the two trials against Manafort, it emerged that he and his business partner Rick Gates had worked with Podesta’s brother Tony to fleece Ukrainian oligarchs for years, and stash the profits in tax havens.

The Ukrainian officials who leaked the so-called “black ledger” implicating Manafort to the US media were even convicted of election meddling by a court in Kiev, and the whole thing may have been solicited by a Ukrainian-American DNC contractor… The US media have been curiously uninterested in that particular “collusion,” needless to say.

Peel back all these layers of misinformation, like an onion, and what’s left is an empty talking point, endlessly repeated by Democrats like Adam Schiff (D-California), that “Russia hacked our democracy.”

The charge is vague enough that it can mean anything, and deliberately so. No evidence is ever offered, because there isn’t any – as the years of investigations and boxes full of documents have clearly shown.

1004,1626,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/killing_off_a_pandemic_is_engineering_not_science.html,2020-05-21,"Killing Off a Pandemic is Engineering, Not 'Science'","More than half a century ago a fellow grad student invited me into his laboratory to show me his doctoral research. He introduced me to the science of animal reflexes. A novel stimulus induces in an animal, however briefly, a freeze reaction. This is called an “orienting reflex.” What happens next depends on the animal’s response to the potential threat. If the novel stimulus does not seem to be a threat the animal gradually relaxes. Repeats of this type of stimulus gradually habituate its orienting reflex so that the animal, in effect, learns to ignore this particular stimulus.

On the other hand, in the case of a real threat, the animal can only respond in one of two ways: It can freeze for an extended length of time or it can panic and run to escape.

Humans, too, experience the orienting freeze reflex to novel stimuli. If the stimulus is a threat, a person may freeze in place for a substantial time, or the person may flee in panic. Or, and this is what makes humans different from all animals, some people may become coldly rational and plan out, and execute, an appropriate course of action. Training, especially, helps create this rational response.

The important thing to note is that the orienting reflex is so essential to survival that it evolved very early in the history of life. Its creation was back so deep in time that we share the orienting reflex with insects, with spiders, and with even more primitive creatures.

Society emulates an organism. An animal is a collection of functioning elements, all working in cooperation. It is useful to consider a society, such as America, as a kind of organism analogous to an animal. Individual people make up the cooperating functional elements of society. I postulate that our society has an orienting reflex, as well.

Consider the response of America to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor: Shock! Freeze! Anger! That was the first orienting response. Then, since we are human, came coldly rational plans, then fully unified action to destroy this threat to our existence. Consider America’s first response to 9-11. Initially it was the same, but soon different factions chose to use the event to promote their ideologies. Instead of unity we had disunity. America has changed — and not for the better.

Think of America’s response to COVID-19. We indeed have had the orienting reflexive freeze. What is this new threat? We wondered. What are its characteristics? What should we know about it? Because of the novelty of this virus we knew too little to make rational plans. Our natural reaction was to continue the orienting freeze reflex until we could find a way to defeat it.

We did know at the beginning a few things about this new disease: We knew that this virus is exceptionally contagious. One thing we thought we knew (but maybe were wrong about) was that this virus is exceptionally deadly. The thing we were certain of was that a really serious pandemic would overload our medical facilities. Rational response required a temporary lockdown to “flatten the curve” so as to not overload our medical establishment. This we did — successfully.

But then politics intervened — big time! There are people in our society who lust for power and luxuriate in it once they have it. Some are elected, many are not. Call them governors, call them mayors, call them health administrators, call them bureaucrats, call them “journalists,” the power mad have become a potentially lethal plague on America. They have suspended our civil liberties “for the duration.”

So what is the duration? These power-mad people have moved the goal posts to the undeterminable far future when a vaccine cure will be available. There has never been a successful vaccine for an upper respiratory corona virus. So don’t count on it this time. If we do get one an instant Nobel prize awaits. Waiting for a vaccine is just an excuse for continued suppression of our liberties. Moving the goal posts is profoundly dishonest and un-American.

In the name of “science” some governors forbade experimentation with various pharmaceutical treatments. When President Trump suggested that early experiments indicated that a combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin was effective in stopping an early stage infection, the Left: left academics, left “journalists,” left bureaucrats, and left politicians, went berserk: Politics (I spit the word out)!

It is commonplace to say that the pandemic is a science problem. No it is not! Science has to do with fundamental understanding. Figuring out the molecular action of this coronavirus is science. Defeating the pandemic is not science. Defeating the pandemic is engineering!

When I was just starting my career as an engineering physicist I was told a story. The story is likely apocryphal, but it illustrates the profound difference between science and engineering: One day the ancient Romans decided to bring fresh water down from the mountains to the city. Naturally they hired the best hydraulic specialists — the Greeks — the masters of the science of hydrostatics. The Greeks said that the pressure in a tall waterpipe would be very great. They were right, of course. Therefore, buttress the outside of your filled pipes, they advised, to prevent their explosion. The Romans did as suggested. However, when the water started to flow the pipes imploded instead of exploded. No one knew why this happened. The Romans simply shrugged their shoulders and buttressed the inside of these water pipes — with great success. About two thousand years later the Bernoulli brothers found the scientific explanation. So, science is nice, but engineering works.

Who are the engineers in this pandemic? The doctors on the front line, of course. These are the pragmatic guys who are willing to try anything to save the lives of their patients — even if the academic scientists say don’t. Let’s also give credit to the hands-on lab scientists who are working, often with great ingenuity, to find a vaccine. That too is engineering, only at the molecular level.

Now that the pandemic is easing up a bit I was able to chat about this with a highly regarded infectious medicine specialist. This is a man who once saved my life by working in his lab to devise an antibiotic cocktail for me. This, after all conventional treatments had failed. This good doctor has spent almost every waking hour of the last two months saving the lives of COVID patients, some of whom were in intensive care. He has found that the hydroxychloroquine cocktail works with patients in the early to mid-phase of infection, but not much in the intensive care phase. He uses other techniques in the late phase. His experience with the cocktail corresponds to that of other doctors. The hydroxy cocktail is therefore a very effective prophylactic, or curative, depending on the stage of infection. But not later on.

When I mentioned the notion that, in this pandemic, he was an engineer, not a scientist, he most emphatically agreed. Then this mild mannered man surprised me by using very strong language with respect to the “science” advisors to the politicians.

Science has its place. Ultimately we will understand this new contagion and eliminate its threat. In the meantime, it is the medical engineers who are the key to defeating this invader: the medical doctors on the front line; the people working on vaccines and other medications. And, of equally great importance, let us not forget the business owners, small and large, who are the engineers of our economy. All these practical people should be the ones guiding society back to normality — not the power hungry politicians and, most especially, not the technocrat “scientists.”",fake
1005,959,https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/5/14/21258621/barack-obama-2020-presidential-race-donald-trump-coronavirus-response-joe-biden-election,2020-05-14,Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race,"WASHINGTON — Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.

Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.

For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.

“Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.

The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.

Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.

Trump’s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately “unmasking” Flynn’s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump’s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.

Despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it “Obamagate.” He’s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: “What did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?”

Trump’s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.

Trump’s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president’s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.

Biden’s campaign drew a direct connection between the president’s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.

“It’s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.

Trump’s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ’s decision to drop the Flynn case put the “rule of law at risk.” He also criticized the Trump White House’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden’s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign’s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.

Though Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He’s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.

But the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he’s told advisers he’s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.

Biden’s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.

A recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.

Obama’s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.",real

Gretchen Whitmer’s announcement Monday of a partial reopening of those regions starting Friday.

“I’m very confident,” said Amanda Danielson, a co-owner of Italian restaurant Trattoria Stella in Traverse City. “We put all of our safety protocols in place as if we were receiving guests knowing that eventuality. We feel very prepared to be able to do so in a safe manner.”

Traverse City is located in one of 17 northern Michigan counties that — along with the entire Upper Peninsula — will see lessened restrictions on Friday.

Whitmer’s plan reopens retail businesses and offices as well as bars and restaurants operating at 50% capacity. Employees must be trained on safety protocols.

“Obviously our biggest concern is the safety of our staff,” Danielson said. “We’re not a hotspot up here. We’ve had every few cases relatively speaking, which why we’re able to reopen, but at the same time the people that come here are from high-infected areas… Stella will look a little different until the scare of the virus is gone.”

Danielson said they’ve shifted the floor plan of the restaurant and cordoned off seating. Seating will only be available through reservations.

The relaxed rules represent a major step for restaurants, said Justin Winslow, president and CEO of the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association. The organization recently provided restaurateurs a roadmap to reopening that addresses sanitation, customer health and social distancing.

“What happens in these two regions is going to help set the stage for what we hope is a quick reopening for the rest of the state…” Winslow said. “Even if you’re not in one of those two regions, it’s a sign of hope. It’s a tangible specific date certain that we know a restaurant will have the opportunity to demonstrate that they can operate safely.""

In Sault Ste. Marie, Laurie Jarvie of gift shop Field and Forage said she’s excited to open her doors to customers again. She’s been operating her business through online sales, delivery and curbside pickups.

Jarvie said she was surprised by the governor’s decision for a partial reopening. She notes the low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chippewa County which includes Sault Ste. Marie. Since its last report last week there were seven confirmed cases in the county.

“I feel like the rest of the state really got punished because of the way things were downstate…” Jarvie said.

Jeff Bladzik, co-owner of the Painted Lady Saloon in Manistee, will continue to run the dining portion of the business as carryout only and allow drinkers at the bar.

“We’ve been doing to-go through this whole thing and we just feel it will add a lot of chaos to us if we’re trying to do in-house,” he said. “If the amount of takeout stays at the level it is, we won’t be able to handle it both ways because of the limited space we have in our kitchen.""

Warren Call, president and CEO of Traverse Connect, which merged with the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce in 2019, said his organization has advocated for the phased reopening announced by Whitmer on Monday because nearly half of his area's employees are in the hospitality and healthcare sectors.

""It's only a handful of industries, but it's an important step in the process,"" he said. ""It's always amazing how flexible entrepreneurs are. We've seen great pivots for businesses adding curbside, take out, catering and now they can add to that partial re-openings that will only help them get enough cash flow to make it work. We're making sure every sector is prepared when they get their shot.""

Rich Studley, president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said the phased re-opening is ""long overdue"" and ""should have happened weeks ago.""

""It's been clear the COVID outbreak is subsiding in Michigan,"" he said. ""There's a lot of good people in the (Whitmer) administration, but there's not a lot of people in the administration who have ever owned and operated a business.""

Studley said the next few weeks will be critical for seasonal businesses.

""This is when you have soft openings,"" he said. ""This is when they stock the shelves. This is when they do trainings. If you're a hospitality business in the U.P. and you're not open by Memorial Day ... in many cases, they only have June, July and August to earn the revenue need for the year.""

Bill Golden, co-president of Golden Shoes on Traverse City's Front Street, said his business has been down 96% since he started doing curbside orders only on March 20. He's been planning for the day when his business was cleared to reopen.

""I have all my (personal protective equipment),"" he said. ""Masks, gloves. Two weeks ago I had the carpets cleaned. I said I want to be ready when it's time to go.

""The only thing I don't have is signs for distancing and I pick those up tomorrow,"" Golden continued. ""I have my thermometer. Every one of my employees is going to have their temperature taken when they come through the door.""

Tina Schuett, owner of the Rare Bird Brewpub in Traverse City, is not ready to re-open right away.

""We're not going to open until the 28th just to make sure we're keeping our staff and patrons safe,"" she said. ""We kind of want to let the first wave pass by and then we'll jump in.""

Schuett is also worried about a potential influx of out-of-towners from areas of the state that will still be closed.

""The scariest thing to us is the fact that people from downstate, in the higher-risk zones, are going to be coming up here now,"" she said. ""It seems like a guarantee that we will see an increase in cases up here when it happens.""

Editor, Health Impact News

There has been much written lately about how the COVID-19 “pandemic” is being used as an excuse to usher in some kind of national “Medical ID” that could be used as a tool to control our daily activities, and be used as a requirement to do almost everything in society, from buying goods to travel to receiving medical treatment and beyond.

Such concerns are certainly legitimate given what we have seen so far in the “war against the invisible enemy” and the government’s reaction to this “war.”

But opportunists taking advantage of the COVID-19 responses who would love to track and control most aspects of your personal life are not simply restricted to a medical ID card.

I was recently in a store purchasing some grocery products, and the sign at the checkout said: “Due to the Coronavirus situation we are no longer accepting cash.”

This may seen like a minor inconvenience to most people, but Attorney James Rickards, an American lawyer, economist, and investment banker with 35 years of experience working in capital markets on Wall Street, has been warning about the “War on Cash” for years now. When the flow of cash is limited to digital money and the approval of banks, near total control of the population is much more easily accomplished.

Back in 2016 he wrote:

I’ve been warning investors for months about the war on cash. This war has been in full swing in Europe and the U.S. for a long time. Governments plan to use negative interest rates, confiscatory taxes and other techniques to rob savers of their wealth. In order to do this, they have to force savings into digital accounts at large government-controlled banks. As long as savers can hold cash, they can avoid many of these confiscation techniques. Therefore, governments must eliminate cash. The latest battleground in this war is India. In a shock announcement on Nov. 8, India declared that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes are no longer legal tender. Imagine that — the money in your wallet or purse is instantly made worthless by government decree. That’s what happened. There were limited exceptions for hospitals and gas stations. Naturally, gas lines formed everywhere, and some people rushed to hospitals to prepay for future medical care with now worthless bank notes. The other exception to worthlessness was if you deposited the notes in the bank. There you would receive “digital credit” in your account. Of course, the tax man was waiting at the bank to ask you where you got the money. Those without an acceptable answer can expect trouble from the Indian Revenue Service. this is not the end of the war on cash. It’s just the beginning. (Read the Full Article Here.)

That was 2016. Today, at the end of April, 2020, he updated his predictions based on the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions currently being taken.",fake
1021,129,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/testing-decisions-may-haunt-nation/,2020-03-23,Testing Decisions May Haunt The Nation,"It is common knowledge to get ahead of any epidemic/pandemic that broad screening of the masses is needed for proper tracking and quarantine procedure in efforts to slow spread and contain the virus. If anything has been shown by events over the past few months, American capabilities in this area are very lacking.

In February 200 test kits produced by the CDC were distributed to over 100 public health labs across the nation; each containing materials to test 300-400 patients and all labs received the same kits which were distributed to equal locales in all states

This decision was prelude to some chaos for the following weeks, in which the availability of the testing was completely out of sync with the number of testing that was and still is needed. South Dakota with few cases may have been getting quick results while areas such as New York, Seattle and San Francisco which were in the middle of serious outbreaks were not able to get enough tests and the information needed to protect the public and stem the curve of the outbreak.

It can’t be stressed enough how critical rapid testing is in the early stages of an outbreak, it allows healthcare workers and families to identify and focus on tracking those possibly exposed, isolating, and treating any who may be infected to attempt to limit and/or contain further spread.

Additionally, during the important early weeks free help from leading global viral experts was not only ignored but also declined by American officials at a time when it would have had the greatest impact to the watching world’s shock. During these weeks the virus took off, without testing that led to no proper tracking and no possibility of containment allowing the virus to spread unknown infecting thousands of people leading to nationwide social distancing and shut down and shelter in place orders. We are now just beginning to grapple within the failure from those early bungles, and it is likely to haunt all of America in the months to come.

The limited and small first shipment to Washington state arrived well after more than weeks weeks after officials announced the first cases of COVID-19 for example, and at that same time outbreaks had been festering in many places within it; as a result within a few mere weeks over three dozen infected would die at a nursing home in the suburbs of Seattle. From that point it did not take long from the virus to continue its rapid spread to overwhelm the state.

The administration has attempted to speed testing after so many missteps have further hampered responses to contain the virus, which has led to officials facing a barrage of criticism from global health experts, state officials, members of Congress, the American healthcare system, and the American public watching the continued bungles.

Federal officials have tried to ease the process for labs to perform their own testing, leading to university and commercial labs ramping up their capacity. Public and private labs are now estimated to be able to test more than 36,000 people a day, but this number can vary considerably and does not indicate how many tests are actually being given or are allowed to be given to patients.

“We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way. We asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected,” Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said Wednesday of private labs’ testing, without elaboration.

But is this ramping up a case of too little too late after weeks of faltering attempts, ignored warnings, denied requests and thousands of undiagnosed people spreading the virus to others, who then go on to continue the unknown spread? Let’s be honest the virus has been here since January, spreading largely unknown, and if any one cares to continue to be honest about it we actually have no idea how many people are infected due to lack of testing, and limiting testing to those displaying multiple symptoms, where's according to WHO 80% of those infected will experience mild to no symptoms.

Then there is the faulty testing, for example on Feb.8, 2020 New York state received a faulty test kit for 800 specimens, this amount is also consistent with that of other states all contributing to lack of containment and further spread. Since then the state has begun testing based on CDC protocols and have tested 7,200 people statewide.

Middle states within American have had few reported outbreaks, and they appear to have the luxury of time to plan such as Missouri only using 395 of their 800 tests reporting 26 positive cases, and when private labs are accounted for that number increases to 47 confirmed cases.

Areas with less international travel to their regions will benefit from that lack. “This is very similar to 1918 with the influenza pandemic—St. Louis had more time to prepare and was able to put measures in place to flatten the curve than, say, Philadelphia,” Lawrence said. “Seattle didn’t have an opportunity to prepare as much in advance.”

As more commercial labs are becoming available, they are having their hands tied with strict restrictions that are limiting their testing capabilities nationwide. Due to the widespread lack of testing there is no way for tens of thousands of people to know if they have come into contact with a person who has been infected until well after it happens, if they find out at all.

“CDC will distribute tests based on where they can do the most good. But without hospital-based testing and commercial testing, it will not be possible to meet the need,” said Tom Frieden, who led the CDC during the Obama administration and is a former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.

California is one of the states currently being hit hard by the initial wave of COVID-19. Many there are being told that they don’t qualify for testing because they have not traveled abroad, or had contact with a confirmed infected person, and are not displaying multiple symptoms. There are many reasons as to why this is wrong, the most important being wide screening is a critical component in any attempt to contain the spread of any outbreak. Some areas weren’t even able to begin their limited restricted testing until March 2 due to issues with the initial faulty test kits.

“We are still limited on extraction kits,” Mandy Cohen, the Health and Human Services secretary in North Carolina, said in an interview in mid-March. Officials earlier this month could test only 300 patients because of shortages in the extraction materials needed to register whether the novel coronavirus is present.

Despite federal officials saying they are sending help/supplies and ramping up efforts, states are still waiting and have been told to purchase their own. In a recent press conference it was brought to the administration's attention that when states try to purchase supplies they are being outbid by federal purchase orders. This was met by snickering, denial and gas lighting comments which does not reflect positively or instill any confidence to the watching people looking for signs of hope.

In many states, testing rules are so strict community outbreaks are going unnoticed until it is too late to go along with the serious lack of test kits. The vast majority of Americans still cannot get tested due to the patchworks of rules governing who can be tested even if a doctor requests permission. Broad testing/screening is critical, that’s a fact.",fake
1026,1270,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/federalisms_latest_champion.html,2020-05-17,Federalism’s Latest Champion,"The further left you go in your politics, the more in favor you are of central government control rather than the sharing of power that is enumerated in federalism. The same, by the way, holds true for the right -- the further right you go, the more in favor are you of central government control. Whether one calls it fascism or totalitarianism, right and left meet at their extremes. Both political philosophies taken to their furthest extreme advocate complete governmental control of your life, work, and movements. Historically, American presidents have occupied a mostly sensible position either slightly to the right or to the left of center during their tenures.

The reason for this is federalism. Dividing power is the best method for maintaining a sensible center. The left, most recently and notably represented by the Previous Occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, faults Donald Trump for “lack of a coherent national strategy” in addressing the knotty problem of what increasingly looks like sort of an “on purpose accident:” the coronavirus epidemic.

Of course. there is no coherent national strategy. Trump has made it clear that virus policy should be set by the states. He instinctively understands federalism’s wisdom. And states have differed widely in their response, depending on the political affiliation of their governors.

Those states in the sensible center, which happen to be mostly governed by Republicans, with a few Democrats thrown in, are maximizing human freedom while taking reasonable precautions to limit the virus’ spread.

Many Democrat governors, on the other hand, are unleashing their inner totalitarian in a virtual orgy of draconian diktats meant to completely control their unhappy constituents in the name of safety. I won’t go into details -- they stare you in the face every day through various news feeds.

There is a growing sense that not only are leftist governors and big-city mayors immensely enjoying their exercise of almost total power, but that they are willing to tank their local economies to lessen the likelihood of Trump’s re-election: “This is great! We tried for three years to railroad the guy out of office and he frustrates us at every turn, then this thing drops in our laps!” They figure the federal government will eventually bail them out. They shouldn’t. Figure, that is.

It’s outrageous almost beyond belief that a faction of this country would not only refuse to work in harmony for the common good, but actually work against the common good, causing acute financial hardship, and, in some cases death, in the process, just because it hates the president and wants to control us.

It’s as if they think we don’t see and understand what they are up to. A prediction: these and previous actions directed against this president during the last forty months will result in his landslide re-election.

And it is this president, Donald John Trump, I’ve come to praise. Like everyone else, my attitude towards DJT during the ’16 election cycle were variations of this five-word opinion a close friend delivered to me during the summer of 2016: “I don’t trust that guy.”

But, happily, my suspicions have been almost completely without foundation. Trump has been a good president, even a great one, all things being equal. Ronald Reagan was president when I was in my late twenties. It was changing then, becoming a lot less leftist in my worldview.

I didn’t realize it at the time, but in Reagan I was living through the tenure of a historically great president. I’m beginning to wonder if the same does not apply to the unlikely figure of Donald Trump. He not only has great instincts, but he has become, in record time, highly adept at moving the levers of power. Has he made mistakes? Oh yeah. Lots. But the general tenor of his tenure has been astoundingly positive for the welfare of the average American.

You sense a changed man in Trump: he’s no longer the grasping, greedy construction mogul. He’s now a man completely dedicated to the welfare of a country he loves with all his heart even to his financial detriment.

Equally importantly, he has taken on a news media that has bullied and belittled us -- Christians, conservatives, libertarians, patriots-the simple people -- for years.

“We’re on to you,” he admonished one reporter in a recent news conference. It’s so much fun to watch. The media still has no idea how to handle him. Trump has managed to bell the cat, and we all know now when the cat is coming, and what the cat is up to.

And now this epidemic. Were almost any president post-Reagan in charge during this crisis, one result would have been a big fat new federal agency: The Department of Epidemiology or some such. Trump refused this golden opportunity to expand the reach of the federal octopus, and simply said that each state must do what is best for its own welfare. This was an extraordinarily wise move. Federalism in action.

The laboratories of democracy went to work, and the results are there for all to see: The growing successes of states opening up their economies again (Florida, Georgia, Texas), and the utter misery of states strangling the freedom of its put-upon constituents (California, Washington, Michigan.)

I could be wrong, but it’s at least possible that we are in the midst of a historically great presidency. God bless and protect Donald J. Trump. He’s our champion, and deserves enormous credit, and our full-throated support, for his textbook exercise of constitutional federalism.",fake

Counterpoint Research and Canalys both put the overall drop in global shipments at 13 percent, though Counterpoint says the drop in China alone was 27 percent while Canalys calculates it at 18 percent.

Whichever numbers you look at, the situation is clear: it’s the first time shipments have come under 300 million since 2014, with a precipitous collapse in China preceding falling demand around the world. “By the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 started to spread to other regions, and lockdowns of varying severity were imposed, the pendulum of disruption started to swing from supply to demand,” Counterpoint’s team of analysts writes in a statement.

Samsung, Huawei, and Apple are still the top three vendors, with Apple seeing the smallest decline in shipments year on year. Both Canalys and Counterpoint rank Xiaomi fourth, cracking 10 percent of global market share for the first time.

“Demand for new devices has been crushed,” says Canalys senior analyst Ben Stanton. “In February, when the coronavirus was centered on China, vendors were mainly concerned about how to build enough smartphones to meet global demand. But in March, the situation flipped on its head. Smartphone manufacturing has now recovered, but as half the world entered lockdown, sales plummeted.”

“From the consumer standpoint, unless replacing a broken phone, smartphones are mostly a discretionary purchase,” says Counterpoint associate director Tarun Pathak. “Consumers, under these uncertain times, are likely to withhold making many significant discretionary purchases. This means the replacement cycles are likely to become longer.”

The true impact of the pandemic is yet to be felt. “Most smartphone companies expect Q2 to represent the peak of the coronavirus’ impact,” says Stanton. “It will test the mettle of the industry, and some companies, especially offline retailers, will fail without government support.”",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

History, as Barack Obama said of American progress, zigs and zags. Great changes set off chain reactions: The Wall Street Crash of 1929 ushered in the New Deal era; Allied victory in 1945 created the conditions for the Cold War. Each event creates political aftershocks and trends that we can see clearly only afterward. The decade that followed the 2008 financial crisis saw the euro zone teeter on the brink of collapse, Britain vote to leave the European Union, and Donald Trump elected president. Today, the global economy has suffered another sudden seizure, shifting geopolitics as U.S.-China tensions have risen, trade has slowed markedly, and structural divisions between northern and southern Europe have widened. The question, then, is what might happen in the decade after this crisis?

“Historians love chapter breaks,” said Robert Kaplan, an American foreign-policy expert and former member of the U.S. Defense Policy Board, who this month briefed officials at 10 Downing Street on the potential second-order effects of the coronavirus crisis. “COVID-19 will come to be seen as a chapter break.”

Among Kaplan’s concerns is how Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, will act, a fear echoed by some of the most influential voices in British foreign policy, who worry that the geopolitical second wave of COVID-19 will hit Europe the hardest. Michael Clarke, a defense-studies professor at King’s College London and former special adviser to Britain’s national committee on security strategy, who remains plugged in to the country’s foreign-policy establishment, told me that an economically weakened Russia, hit by the recent collapse in oil prices, poses a greater danger to Western security interests. “Putin’s aggressive opportunism will probably get worse,” Clarke said. “The nature of Putin’s leadership is that he can’t stand still; he has to keep pushing forward. This makes him more volatile.” What happens if the Russian leader, spooked by the country’s collapsing economy, eyes an opportunity to test NATO’s resolve? Others, such as Bruno Maçães, Portugal’s former Europe minister, told me that the crisis might not embolden Russia, but cripple it, leaving it more dependent on China and bringing Beijing’s sphere of influence to the borders of continental Europe. “Crises,” Kaplan noted, “put history on fast-forward.”

The array of possible second-wave consequences is dizzying: the prospect of the disease taking hold in a developing G20 country—think India—which could see the virus quickly doubling back to Europe and the U.S.; the uncertain impact of technological advances in fields such as artificial intelligence as they are used to help combat the disease’s spread; a recession pulling at the ties between the European Union’s poor south and wealthy north. Clarke is particularly concerned about an arc of instability from West Africa through the Middle East to Asia, where conflict and instability have in recent years forced people to flee. Karin von Hippel, the director general of the Royal United Services Institute, an influential British defense and international-affairs think tank, told me that “some kind of reckoning with China” is likely as well. “Some countries will emerge from this trying to cling to China … but most others are likely to try to decouple,” she said. For Britain, Germany, France, and other major European economies reliant on the American security umbrella but wanting to maintain strong economic ties with China, the difficulty of managing the fallout from the Trump administration’s anti-China rhetoric may now only increase.",real

Viruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.

The pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.

Given the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world’s medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world’s governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.

But, for a moment, let’s assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world’s scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.

A virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?

These are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don’t have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)

Those who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.

Following is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.

There are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.

Ionic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper

Before antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)

Ozone

Ozone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.

Oxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide

Oxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.

Hydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen

There is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). “Three Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy” which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)

Intravenous and Oral Vitamin C

Vitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)

Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence

Exposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920’s and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner’s treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)

This article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed. There is much more in that warehouse of human ingenuity. Remember the most vulnerable are the young, old, and those with existing conditions. This discussion will be continued.",fake

The country is slowly reopening after almost two months of strict lockdown.

Escalating tensions over China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic could be a ""major risk"" to economic recovery —and may even lead to a trade war worse than the one between Beijing and Washington, one investor told CNBC.

From the U.S. to Europe to Australia, more and more world leaders are calling for China to be investigated over the origins of the outbreak, which was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December.

As economies prepare to reopen again after weeks of lockdown to stem the virus' spread, recovery could be derailed by political tensions, said David Sokulsky, CEO and chief investment officer of Concentrated Leaders Fund.

""That's a major risk which isn't being priced in at the moment,"" he told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Thursday.

""As we pass peak infection rates, the politicians are going to want to blame somebody, and the obvious target for that blame is China,"" he added.",real

US-based political analyst Don Debar reflects on the latest US moves towards China and the WHO amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Sputnik: US President Donald Trump has shared a letter in his Twitter account in which he threatened to make the WHO funding freeze permanent and ""reconsider our membership"" in the organisation if the agency ""does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days"". How likely is it that the US will permanently freeze its funding to WHO?

Don Debar: It's quite possible that they will not just freeze it, even roll it back. You know, there are several things at play around this question. First is that Trump's base, the core Republican voters have always had an antipathy towards the United Nations and, you know, the institutions of the United Nations, the World Health Organization is, of course, you know, one of the children of the United Nations. And even back in the 50s, they loved candidates that were running on the Republican Party platform, (calling for the White House to) get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.

So there is a latent sentiment in that direction that he's playing to the base on. And so you have to take with that grain of salt - him saying this is an opportunity for him to do some U.N. bashing in coded language to some core part of his constituency, the Republican Party constituency.

But that said, this also comes in the midst of his ongoing trade dispute. You know, the renegotiation essentially of the economic relations between the United States and China. And that's been a project of the Trump administration's, you know, from the beginning. They announce they were going to do. The trade situation was unfavourable to the United States, that the employment situation was completely destroyed in the United States and this was all going to be remedied with hard negotiations with China.

Well, you know, this virus epidemic or a pandemic has provided a perfect opportunity for him to China bash that he’s taken full advantage of. When he's taking full advantage of, he's blaming this entire megillah on China, on their being secretive, on their being incompetent, on just how you should have been played better with us. And so as he's having negotiations with China saying, I want you to drop this tariff and, you know, renegotiate that. He's also screaming in the public sphere, you know, things that China would probably prefer, he said. Right. Look, I'll go. What do you want us to stop? What do you want? What do you want? No, this a negotiation tactic. And it's that's got to be looked at in that context as well.

Now, this was the World Health Organization itself goes. It was a journalist, for example, an international journalist knows that the U.N.'s. It may be the best organization of its kind available right now, but it is far from ideal or perfect.

And certainly its governance and operation are a reflection of various power of various elites around the world and particularly Western imperialism, United States. If you deal with the media operation at the UN as I know you do and I do. You know that a speech by the foreign Minister of Iran at a U.N. Security Council meeting. Even if he does it in English, which he's done plenty of times, it will not appear in the media, for a download that afternoon or that news cycle or for 10 days, if ever, whereas the slightest utterance from whichever knucklehead the United States has as a permanent representative at the time, will go out exactly like that.

And Trump mentions this in a way at his press conference yesterday saying, you know, the United States spends $450 million towards the WHO budget. And China spends $40 million towards their budget, maybe i’ll cut this back. We're talking about being way out of scale in terms of operations.

© REUTERS / LEAH MILLIS U.S. President Donald Trump talks with Will Guidara of the Independent Restaurant Coalition, and his economic advisor Larry Kudlow at the conclusion of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic meeting with restaurant executives and industry leaders in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., May 18, 2020.

Now if they're not responding to what Trump wants, however, we have to understand that Trump's power - and elite and state power of the United States - are not the same. People that are in the operating elite, of the officer class, or whatever, at the United Nations, the officials, those are people that are there as part of what they call the deep state. Those are people that were appointed over the years, part of a permanent bureaucracy. They are vetted through the EU, through Congress, through State Department, through the World Bank, through IMF, all these different institutions.

And so it's quite possible that although the WHO was not doing what Trump would like, it doesn't necessarily mean it is doing the right thing either. It may well be being used or he perceives it as being used as just another agent of the people that would like to get him out of office.

(For example) “I would like to point out basically, you know, what, this insight we found today this entire disease came off of a culture from a napkin that was found in that hotel room from Trump's dossier. And that's the original source. And then they dropped that off in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown in New York when Trump was still living in New York. And that's where this disease came from, it’s Trump's fault.”

And there are some folks probably trying to figure out that kind of a narrative or that angle and there they are because they were put there by the Clinton or Bush or, you know, some other person over the years.

So the point is still down to this one. People have to not look at the World Health Organization as if it's an honest broker. This is not this is a self-interested group like any other and is very closely aligned with the elites of Western Europe, the United States and Japan.

Secondly, Trump has to pitch this whole feud with international institutions to his base. And there's an element of that going on in there.

And finally I think that we have to also consider the possibility that whatever is happening, we're going to have to construct something entirely different to respond in the future, because no matter pointing the finger at anyone, everyone has failed thus far.

This is the 21st century. So some virus that appears either in cattle in Omaha or somewhere in room on China or wherever it came from, should not spread around the world and bring death with it without us having at least enough masks and ventilators to deal with the outcome, let alone a responsive health care system that could identify this and give us in the 21st century already vaccines and whatever solutions there are in biology because they're there. And if we don't have them yet, it's because we've been spending money on missiles and bombs and wars instead of medicine.

Sputnik: How reasonable is it to leave WHO during a critical global pandemic? How timely is this measure?

Don Debar: Well, having a feud with the World Health Organization at a different time would mean nothing. There'd be no attention paid to it. So in a way, as you know, counterintuitive as it seems, this is exactly the time to have this conversation because people are paying attention to it. And again, one has to consider not just who do people think the World Health Organization is, but what, in fact, is the World Health Organization.

Now, there was a very interesting discussion of some of these points that President Xi Jinping had on Monday at the opening of the World Health Assembly. And I suggest that people take a listen to that – it’s from 10 to 15 minutes long. And he detailed a lot of this. But now we have to we have to we should be looking at not just, you know, how is this good or bad to be doing this to the WHO right now. But what is it that we lack that we need to get? There's a larger question. So, you know, either we enhance the World Health Organization, that's fine. If we correct some of the problems or you know, or we scrap it, that's fine, too, if we put something else there. But we need to have infrastructure to deal with these kinds of things and it has to work better than this has worked so far.

Sputnik: What role does the United States play in WHO as a whole? If they come out in the end, how will this affect the organisation?

Don Debar: This is more like a business management question. If the United States is in World Health Organization, OK, and the United States is outside of World Health Organization and everything else is a constant. That's one question. And but, of course, that's not how things work in the real world. There are some functions that are performed by or through or in coordination with or under the supervision of the World Health Organization. That is possible because of the $450 million a year or whatever it is that the United States contributes to.

Presumably, if the U.S. pulled out of that, that money would no longer be available. OK. Well, that been some of those things will no longer be performed by or with the WHO. Are they things that need to be performed. What would be doing it instead? What structures would arise. You know, instead, what other regrouping is of existing structures? How would people divide the labor basically, if the existing division of labor had to be scrapped because the US pulled out of the World Health Organization, or alternatively, if the U.S. pulls out and nothing changes then good, here's $450 million, we'll spend it on something else. Just go buy some penicillin or Band-Aids or whatever.

And you have to look at the whole picture to answer to that question. And I don't think we have a picture of the whole picture yet. I think that what this pandemic, if nothing else, has shown us, there are huge holes in the global health system if there can even be one worthy of that name. You know, like a unitary human health system. And I think the questions ought to be, what do we need as a species to survive? What resources are available realistically that we can apply to that and how can we organize them?

And then you come to the big question - by what process do we make these determinations that achieve this? I think we need to get on it, though, because we're living closer and closer to each other. It’s more and more crowded. there's more and more cross contamination of societies. You go from China today to Manhattan and suddenly people are sneezing two days later, then somebody gets on a plane from San Francisco and goes to Beijing. You know, people in Wuhan are bleeding out of their eyes or something and we’re all living closer together and there’s questions over infrastructure and environment and we’re going to be facing these kind of crises more and more and it’s a crapshoot whether one of them comes through that has a 100% fatality rate or not before we get to dealing with it. So what are we spending money on right now that we could be spending money on to prevent that from happening instead?

Sputnik: The United States under Donald Trump has the image of a country that has unilaterally withdrawn from many important treaties. How will this exit affect the image of the country and Trump himself?

Don Debar: As somebody that comes out of a business that is transactional in nature, real estate. That stuff is basically you're sitting down and making dealmaking all the time. Transactional. Yeah. So what do you see? See an agreement for the first time that's been made by somebody else is, you know, what are the costs and benefits of this and can we get a better deal? And so he has and this, you know, he speaks in those terms, even when he looks at these things, the deal with Iran, we can get a better deal.

The deal was on the table with North Korea. We'll get a better deal. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Better deal. Better deal than the nuclear nonproliferation treaty reduction, whatever they need. Several things that they scrapped.

By the way, George Bush scrapped up the more important ones than what Trump scrapped.

You know, optics of this, all of that. And now would he be walking away from or renegotiating? And then what's his image? What image is he projecting? There are some agreements I would love to see him walk away from that he sort of threatened to do when he was running for office and got my attention. We're talking here about scrapping NATO, for example, looking at the military alliances in general and say, do we really need these in the 21st century? There's no longer a massive threat of a world war. We don't really have any big enemies. Do we need to be wasting all this money on all this stuff?

Now, he had to revise that, but not fundamentally as he started to implement different things. Also, the newspapers are calling him a traitor. They're calling him an isolationist and all of this. So he sort of skated that way and actually spent more money on the military budgets than the others, although I think he sees them and he speaks of them as jobs bills.

“I'm not allowed to spend money any other place, but on weapons fine, buy weapons, at least somebody is going to get work.”

But there's some other agreements that I'd like to see him walk away from. The JCPOA, I think. I don't think was a catastrophe that everybody makes it out to be except the catastrophe is that the sanctions have continued. But a long story short, as far as that goes, the agreements that he has abrogated, NAFTA, that he renegotiated - the ongoing negotiations with China over trade…walking away from the TPP, a lot of those I think a lot of people were in favor of. And in fact, they are some of the reasons that he got elected. Those are not things that are popular with you know, the people who were the political elite for the 40 years prior to Trump but these are things that were popular with voters. Now they're not popular with the media. So the image that comes out of this is that he's just a wrecker.

If you come in there and you have a marriage, he’ll wreck that. If you have a partnership on a little grocery store he’ll wreck that, he's just a, you know, crazy anarchistic maniac. And if you have an agreement, he's going to break it. But that's an image that's being sold for in the media. It's because of the ongoing media antipathy towards him. But and also by a lot of the players. Iran, for example, should, you know, be angry with Trump and criticize Trump over him abrogating their agreement because they are actually materially suffering from sanctions that Trump and the U.S. government have put on. Although, you know, I point out that Congress passed sanctions against Iran all by itself without Trump and against Russia and North Korea, if we go back to 2017, 2018.

But between the thing itself, which is the abrogation of treaties and the image, I think there's a big difference. A lot of the things that he has renegotiated or abrogated should have been - not all, but some certainly a lot of them, like TPP.

And the image, however, is something is being crafted by a third party, by the media and by, you know, just people that are on the other side of the table around the world. And that is what it is. It's an image. It’s maybe the honest perception of some and a fair one. And for others, it's one, you know, is being peddled just like every other image that’s being peddled.

Plant leaders sent messages to workers in the Fremont factory’s paint and stamping operations asking them to respond and confirm whether they plan to come to work, according to Bloomberg.

Tesla temporarily shut down its Fremont plant March 23rd but continued trying to convince local officials that the factory was an “essential business” that shouldn’t be subject to the shelter-in-place order. The company argued it should be categorized as “national critical infrastructure” under the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

The Fremont plant produces Tesla’s Model 3, Model S, Model X, and Model Y vehicles.

However, the Alameda County health officer determined that keeping the plant open was a public health risk, and Fremont police chief Kimberly Petersen told Tesla the rules would not be suspended for the Fremont facility.

A spokesperson for Fremont police said in an email to The Verge on Sunday that the health order was still in effect. Violation of the order is a misdemeanor which could carry a fine or imprisonment.

Several other automakers are looking to restart production in early May. Ford said on Sunday it was recalling a small crew of workers Monday to prep factories to reopen, the Detroit Free Press reported, but did not say which sites or how many workers were involved. The Freep reported that the callbacks were voluntary, meaning workers would be paid if they worked but would not be required to do so.

GM still has not announced an official reopening date. The United Auto Workers union says for its members, it believes opening in early May is “too soon and too risky.” Ford and GM are union shops, Tesla is not.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from The Verge on Sunday.

A group of protesting truck drivers loudly honking their horns interrupted President Donald Trump during a press conference on Friday.

Trump, who was discussing efforts to produce a coronavirus vaccine, called the honking a ""sign of love.""

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Protesting truck drivers interrupted a White House press conference on the coronavirus on Friday.

President Donald Trump took a moment away from discussing efforts to produce a vaccine to praise the drivers, calling their protest a ""sign of love.""

""Do you hear that outside, that beautiful sound?"" Trump said. ""Those are truckers that are with us all the way.

""They're protesting in favor of President Trump, as opposed to against him,"" he added. ""Hundreds of trucks out there. And that's the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protest. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me, and I like them. We're working on something together.""

Trump made similar comments on a Thursday interview with Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo as truck horns drowned out their conversation. Bartiromo clarified that the horns came from truck drivers who were protesting, and Trump pushed back.

""Well, they're not protesters,"" Trump said. ""They're supporters of me because we are getting things for the truckers, and all those great truckers that are all over the country. They're honking and they're really very thankful that I'm president frankly.""

Why truck drivers are protesting

The truck drivers were, in fact, protesting rock-bottom rates, not celebrating Trump. Since mid-April, drivers in Texas, California, Arizona, and Washington, DC, have taken to the streets in their big rigs to demand government support.

April rates for spot-market loads — trucking jobs tendered in real time rather than through a prearranged contract — were 54% lower than in April 2019, according to data from the load-board company DAT. Rates in April fell to five-year lows for refrigerated and flatbed loads.

Meanwhile, the $2 trillion stimulus bill that Trump signed into law in late March did not provide any direct support for truck drivers. Several truck drivers who applied for a loan through the Small Business Administration told Business Insider that they were not able to get funding, putting their livelihoods at risk.

For Joe Plummer, the pay to take a truckload of goods from his home base in North Carolina to Los Angeles had plummeted to $2,700 from $4,700 two months ago.

""We don't need memes and news conferences saying 'We support truckers,'"" Plummer previously told Business Insider. ""We need fuel to stay low, rates to go up, and some type of financial assistance until we recover.""

There are nearly 2 million truck drivers in the US. About 350,000 to 400,000 of them own and operate their own trucks, while many work for small companies in need of financial assistance.

Cass Information Systems said April freight volumes hit levels not seen since 2009, obliterating take-home pay for drivers.

Trump has pledged to help truck drivers, but some say they are just a 'political toy'

While Trump said truck drivers loved him, their relationship has been a bit rocky in recent years. Several blamed Trump in 2019 for destroying their livelihoods as his trade war lowered US manufacturing output.

Trump has rallied behind truck drivers in recent weeks. He told ""Fox & Friends"" earlier this month that truck drivers were being ""price gouged"" by the brokers who match them with retailers and manufacturers, adding that he was ""going to take care of them.""

Some drivers, however, have expressed their frustration that Trump is using them as ""a political toy.""

""You're a political toy! Placated and being used,"" trucking activist Charles Claburn wrote on Facebook, as reported by Transportation Nation Nework. ""You leave that street (and) it's over. We need more trucks. They see us, now they need to hear us! There needs to be a clear ultimatum sent by this industry they have 6 weeks to deliver the promises, if not in writing, then it's time to do it right.""

Until changes are made, truck drivers like Plummer don't know whether they'll keep working at all.

""We are risking our health and lives to take rates that wouldn't pay for our business,"" he said.

In 1965, scientists identified the first human coronavirus; it was associated with the common cold. The Coronavirus family, named for their crown-like appearance, currently includes 36 viruses. Within that group, there are 4 common viruses that have been causing infection in humans for more than sixty years. In addition, three pandemic coronaviruses that can infect humans: SARS, MERS, and now, SARS-CoV-2.

As the news of deaths in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran began to saturate every form of media 24/7, we became familiar with a new term: COVID-19. To be clear, the name of the newly identified coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2. This virus is associated with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, the complex of symptoms that form the diagnosis of COVID-19.

The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, then on February 2 placed a ban on the entry of most travelers who had recently been in China.

On February 4, Alex Azar, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of public health emergency and activated the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, otherwise known as the PREP Act. This nefarious legislation provides complete protection of manufacturers from liability for all products, technologies, biologics, or any vaccine developed as a medical countermeasure against COVID-19. For those nervously waiting for the vaccine to become available, be sure to understand the PREP Act before rushing to the get in line.

Calls for testing – to see if a person is or isn’t infected – began soon after the emergency was declared, but performing those tests was initially slow due to an inadequate number of test kits. As the kits became available, those developed by the CDC had a defect: The reagents reacted to the negative control sample, making the test inaccurate and the kits unusable.

In various countries, thousands of test kits purchased from China were found to be contaminated with the SARS-CoV-2 viruses. No one really knows how that happened, but theories spread like wildfire.

Could the test kit infect the person being tested? Or, did it mean the test would return a false-positive result, driving up the numbers of those said to be infected so those in power could implement stronger lockdowns and accelerate the hockey-stick unemployment rates? Neither of those questions has been adequately answered.

Mandatory Testing…of what?

Authorities claim that testing is important for public health officials to assess if their mitigation efforts – “shelter in place” and “social distancing” and “wearing a mask” – are making a difference to “flatten the curve.” Officials also claim that testing is necessary to know how many persons are infected within a community and to understand the nature of how coronaviruses spread.

Are these reasons sufficient to give up our health freedom and our personal rights, being tested and shamed in public?

Despite the challenges with test kits, testing began. By the end of March 2020, more than 1 million people had been tested across the US. By May 9, the number tested had grown to over 8.7M. Testing methods include a swab of the nasal passages or by inserting a long, uncomfortable swab through the nose to scrape the back of the throat. Specimens have also been obtained bronchoalveolar lavage, from sputum, and from stool specimens.

The call for mandatory testing has been gathering steam and becoming ever more onerous. In Washington state, Governor Inslee has declared:

Individuals that refuse to cooperate with contact tracers and/or refuse testing, those individuals will not be allowed to leave their homes to purchase basic necessities such as groceries and/or prescriptions. Those persons will need to make arrangements through friends, family, or state provided ‘family support’ personnel.

But what do the results really mean?

Who Should Be Tested

On May 8, 2020, the CDC has listed specific priorities for when testing should be done. As of May 16,more than 11-million samples have been collected and more than 3700 specimens have not yet been evaluated.

High Priority

Hospitalized patients with symptoms

Healthcare facility workers, workers in living settings, and first responders with symptoms

Residents in long-term care facilities or other congregate living settings, including prisons and shelters, with symptoms

Priority

Persons with symptoms of potential COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat

of potential COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat Persons without symptoms who are prioritized by health departments or clinicians, for any reason, including but not limited to public health monitoring, sentinel surveillance, or screening of asymptomatic individuals according to state and local plans.

Read that last priority again: That means virtually everyone can be required to get a test.

Is that a violation of your personal rights? And, if you submit to testing, what does a “positive test” actually mean?

Types of Testing: RT-PCR

PCR, short for polymerase chain reaction, is a highly specific laboratory technique. The key to understanding PCR testing is that PCR can identify an individual specific virus within a viral family.

However, a PCR test can only be used to identify DNA viruses; the SARS-CoV2 virus is an RNA virus. Therefore, multiple steps must be taken to “magnify” the amount of genetic material in the specimen. Researchers used a method called RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, to specifically identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It’s a complicated process. To read more about it, go hereand here.

If a nasal or a blood sample contains a tiny snip of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, RT-PCR can identify it, leading to a high probability that the person has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

However – and this is important – a positive RT-PCR test result does not necessarily indicate a full virus is present. The virus must be fully intact to be transmitted and cause illness.

RT-PCR Testing: The Importance of Timing

Even if a person has had all the symptoms associated with a coronavirus infection or has been closely exposed to persons who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the probability of a RT-PCR test being positive decreases with the number of days past the onset of symptoms.

According to a study done by Paul Wikramaratna and others:

For a nasal swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 94% on day 0 to about 67% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a 2% chance of a positive result.

the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 94% on day 0 to about 67% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a of a positive result. For a throat swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 88% on day 0 to about 47% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a 1% chance of a positive result.

In other words, the longer the time frame between the onset of symptoms and the time a person is tested, the more likely the test will be negative.

Repeat testing of persons who have a negative test may (eventually) confirm the presence of viral RNA, but this is impractical. Additionally, repeated testing of the same person can lead to even more confusing results: The test may go from negative, to positive, then back to negative again as the immune system clears out the coronavirus infection and moves to recovery.

And what makes this testing even more confusing is that the FDA admits that

“The detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR does not necessarily equate with an infectious virus.”

Let’s break that down:

You’ve had all the symptoms of COVID19, but your RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative.

Does that mean you’re “good to go” – you can go to work, go to school or you can travel? OR…

Does that mean your influenza-like illness was caused by some other pathogen, possibly one of the four coronaviruses that have been in circulation for 60 years? OR…

Does that mean the result is a false-negative and you still have the infection, but it isn’t detectable by current tests? OR…

Does that mean it was a sample was inadequately taken due to the faulty technique by the technician? OR…

Does that mean you have not been exposed, and you are susceptible to contracting the infection, and you need to stay in quarantine?

So, what does a “positive” test actually mean? And that’s the problem:

No one knows for sure.

Another Type of Testing: Antibodies

According to the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), more than 200 serologic blood tests, to test for antibodies, are either now available or in development.

There are two primary types of antibodies that are assessed for nearly any type of infection: IgM and IgG. While several new testing devices are being touted as a home test, they are not the same as a home pregnancy test or a glucometer to you’re your blood sugar. The blood spot or saliva specimen can be collected at home, must it must then be sent to a laboratory for analysis. It can take a few days – or longer – to get the results. With so many tests in the pipeline, the ability to test at home will be changing over time.

The first antibody to rise is IgM. It rises quickly after the onset of the infection and is usually a sign of an acute, or current, infection. The IgM levels diminish quickly as the infection resolves. The FDA admits they do not know how long the IgM remains present for SARS-CoV-2 as the infection is being cleared.

The interpretation of an IgG antibody is more difficult. This antibody is an indicator of a past infection. The test is often not specific enough to determine if the past infection was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus or one of the four common coronaviruses that cause influenza-like illness.

The FDA says:

Because serology testing can yield a negative test result even if the patient is actively infected (e.g., the body has not yet developed in response to the virus) or maybe falsely positive (e.g., if the antibody indicates a past infection by a different coronavirus), this type of testing should not be used to diagnose an acute or active COVID-19 infection.

Similarly, the CDC says the following regarding antibody testing:

If you test positive: A positive test result shows you have antibodies as a result of an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus. It’s unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus. If you have no symptoms, you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed. It’s possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or have ever had symptoms of COVID-19. This is known as having an asymptomatic infection [ie you have a healthy immune system!] An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

If you test negative If you test negative for antibodies, you probably did not have a previous infection. However, you could have a current infection because antibodies don’t show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies. An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.



What? Wait!

Doesn’t the vaccine industry call the IgG a “protective antibody”?

Isn’t this the marker of immunity they assess after you’ve had an infection with measles or chickenpox or mumps to determine if you are immune to future infections?

Isn’t this the marker of induced immunity they are trying to achieve by administering a vaccine?

If the FDA does not know if an IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 after recovering from the infection is protective against a future infection, then they certainly don’t know if an antibody caused by a vaccine will prevent infection either.

Doesn’t this completely eliminate the theory that antibodies afford protection and antibodies from vaccines are necessary to keep you from getting sick?

Mandatory Testing – New Job Creation

Illinois U.S. Rep. Bobby L. Rush introduced the H.R. 6666 TRACE Act on May 1. On his website, Rush said,

Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.

H.R.6666 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the CDC to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing and then to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals. The contact tracers would be authorized to test people in their homes and as necessary, quarantine people in place.

Where do they intend to do this testing? Besides mobile units to test people in their homes, the bill identifies eight specific locations where the testing and contract tracing could occur: schools, health clinics, universities, churches, and “any other type of entity” the secretary of HHS wants to use.

The bill would allocate $100 billion in 2020 “and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2021 and any subsequent fiscal year during which the emergency period continues.”

But what are they looking for?

Is your test supposed to be positive – saying you’ve been exposed and you’ve possibly recovered?

– saying you’ve been exposed and you’ve possibly recovered? Or is your test supposed to be negative , meaning, you are healthy?

, meaning, you are healthy? Or does a completely negative test – negative RT-PCR test and no IgG antibody mean you’re susceptible to infection and you need to stay in quarantine?

The virus is rapidly mutating, which is rather typical of RNA viruses. In a study published in April 2020, researchers have discovered that the novel coronavirus has mutated into at least 30 different genetic variations. If your RT-PCR test is positive, does this identify exposure to the pandemic virus or exposure to one of the genetic variations? The same can be said about the vaccines under development: With each mutation, is the vaccine more likely to be all risk and no benefit when it reaches the market?

What You Can Do

Across the nation, police are being told to not apprehend criminals but instead, to arrest parents at playgrounds, to arrest lone surfers on public beaches, to fine ministers and congregation members sitting in their cars listening to a service on the radio, and to restrict movement by creating one-way sidewalks.

People have had enough. They are beginning to see the huge scam that has been perpetrated on the entire world over a viral infection with a global death rate of 1.4% (meaning, 1.4% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a fatal outcome, while 98.6% recover). This is far fewer deaths than a severe flu season.

We’re already starting to see the thrust to take our power back:

In Virginia, people went to the beaches en mass, ignoring social distancing and the orders of the Governor to stay home.

and the orders of the Governor to stay home. The central California city of Atwater has declared itself a “sanctuary city,” allowing business owners and churches to open, openly defying Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s coronavirus-related stay-at-home order.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s coronavirus-related stay-at-home order. The truth about wearing masks is starting to come out and people are voting with their feet. Retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Russell Blaylock, warns that not only do face masks fail to protect healthy people from contracting an illness, but they create serious health risks to the wearer.

While they shut us down and held us hostage in our homes, they changed our society, our lives, our world. I am not willing to accept this is the “new normal.”

I won’t submit to testing.

I will refuse mandatory vaccination.

I will stop wearing a mask.

I will not be afraid of standing next to a friend or family member and will not obey the concept of “social distancing.”

I will understand that an asymptomatic carrier is a normal, healthy person and I will not buy into the fear that I might “catch something” from a normal, healthy person.

It’s time for Americans to resist with non-violent civil disobedience. Be brave. Be bold. Put on the full armor of God, as found in Ephesians 6:10-20 in the Bible, to stand against the world rulers of this present darkness. With God on our side, all things are possible.

OPPOSE H.R. 6666, the COVID–19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act

by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC)

Contact your U.S. Congressional Representative and ask them to vote NO on H.R. 6666

H.R. 6666, otherwise known as the COVID–19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on 5/1/2020.

This bill is sponsored by Representative Bobby Rush (D) of Illinois District 1. The bill has 59 cosponsors, 58 Democrats and 1 Republican. We need your help to stop this terrible bill.

Summary

H.R. 6666 provides 100 billion dollars this year and unlimited federal funding in future years to create and operate a massive and likely unconstitutional surveillance, testing, and tracing enforcement system under the guise of “protecting” Americans against coronavirus.

H.R. 6666 is a federal funding bill. It proposes to create a surveillance infrastructure that can be used by the federal government, as well as local and state governments and private businesses, to require medical testing and tracking of all citizens in violation of fundamental civil liberties as set forth in the Bill of Rights, which include the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution designed to protect individual rights and limit the power of the government.

H.R. 6666 lacks safeguards and conditions related to funding of the proposed surveillance operation to prevent it from being applied to intrusive programs mandating testing and surveillance without an individual’s voluntary consent. If this legislation is passed by Congress and enacted into law, it could lead to denial of an individual’s right to appear in public spaces and travel; the right to employment and education or participation in government-funded services, and the right to receive care in a government funded hospital or other any other medical facility.

H.R. 6666 specifically allows for funded entities to home quarantine a person against their will, even while they are healthy. Once a vaccine is available, the testing and tracing results potentially could be used to force individuals to be injected with a COVID-19 vaccine against their will.

According to a Press Release from the sponsor Congressman Bobby L. Rush, “Reopening our economy and getting back to normal will be all but impossible if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing,” said Rep. Rush. “Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.”

The Devil is in the Details

H.R. 6666 would allow The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award federal grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts. Through the use of mobile health units, as necessary, individuals would be tested and provided with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.

The amount of money appropriated for fiscal year 2020 would be $100,000,000,000 (one hundred billion dollars) and more money may be appropriated by Congress as necessary for any subsequent fiscal year during which the emergency period continues.

A grant recipient may use the federal grant funds, in support of the above referenced activities to hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals; and to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.

Priority will be given to applicants in “hot spots” and medically underserved communities and to entities that hire residents of the community where the activity will occur. Hot spots are defined as a geographic area where the rate of infection with the virus that causes COVID–19 exceeds the national average. Medically underserved communities are communities given that term in section 799B of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295p).

Entities eligible for the grant money are defined as a federally qualified health center, school-based clinic, disproportionate share hospital, academic medical center, nonprofit organization, institute of higher education, high school, and any other type of entity as determined by the Secretary of HHS.

H.R. 6666 Does Not Guarantee Privacy

Section 2 (e) of H.R. 6666 is entitled “Federal Privacy Requirements”, but it does little to protect privacy. It states that “Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement, including the regulations promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–191; 110 Stat. 2033) and section 543 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290dd–2).

In actuality, H.R. 6666 offers few privacy protections for Americans who will be surveilled and tested without their consent under programs funded with this grant.

In fact, Americans can expect their privacy to be violated under TRACE funded programs. That is because the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 45 CFR 164.512(b)(1)(i) has always allowed disclosure of private health information to government officials and other government approved entities including foreign governments without the knowledge or consent of the individual for the purpose of conducting public health surveillance, investigations or interventions.

Bill of Rights Cannot Be Suspended During A “Public Health Crisis”

The Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution cannot be set aside by the federal government or state governments during pandemics or other public health emergencies. In The United States Statement of Interest in Support of Plaintiffs, filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a case last month in which church goers attending a drive-in sermon were issued citations for violating an executive order in Mississippi, the DOJ stated;

“There is no pandemic exception, however, to the fundamental liberties the Constitution safeguards. Indeed, “individual rights secured by the Constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis.” In re Abbott, — F.3d —, 2020 WL 1685929, at *6 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020). These individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and restrain government action.”

H.R. 6666 sets the stage for multiple violations of our constitutional rights.

The 4th Amendment right of American citizens is to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The proposed law would provide government funding of entities that create and implement programs to trace and monitor healthy people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.

However, the bill does not allow individuals to exercise their Constitutional right to be safe in their homes free from warrantless government intrusion, and does not provide for voluntary refusal of testing and monitoring by a government funded entity.

The bill also does not set forth how the contacts of persons with COVID-19 will be traced and whether the Constitutional rights of those infected with COVID-19, as well as their contacts, will be upheld.

The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.

This legislation provides government funding of entities that will enforce testing and potentially enforce vaccination of healthy individuals, who are suspected of having come into contact with COVID-19 positive persons whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms, without requiring the voluntary consent of the individual.

The 8th Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment of citizens. The proposed law provides government funding to entities that will create and implement programs that trace, monitor and support the enforced quarantine of healthy individuals, who are suspected of coming into contact with COVID-19 persons, whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms and whether or not they may already be immune.

The 9th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bestows upon the people rights not specifically set forth in the Constitution. H.R. 6666 provides funding for entities to create and implement undefined “related activities” to COVID-19 testing and unnamed “other purposes.”

H.R. 6666 should be opposed because it provides federal funding to entities to create and enforce unrestricted surveillance, testing, tracing and quarantine mechanisms and has no set end date. There is simply no way to know how many inalienable rights protected under the U.S. Constitution could be infringed upon or taken away from citizens if this bill becomes law.

J.B. Pritzker ordered the state’s bars and restaurants to close to dine-in customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outside of attending college at DePaul University, Rucker has never truly left Hyde Park.

Attending Shoesmith and William H. Ray elementary schools, and Kenwood Academy, along with opening up the eatery on 53rd Street (the neighborhood’s business epicenter) has earned her the nickname “Mz. Hyde Park.”

Since the executive order took effect, however, she says she has lost 80% of her business.

“We have been able to stay open every day so far; free delivery service is currently keeping the business afloat,” said Rucker. “So I have been able to keep most of my staff with full-time positions.

“I had a straight business plan for dining and carryout delivery service and I had to revamp my whole system within less than 30 days when they came down with a stay-at-home order. So far, I have been able to keep the business open; that is my community.”

On Wednesdays, Soul Shack gives free meals to Hyde Park’s homeless community. The meal consists of fried chicken and two sides — called “South Sides.”

“Typically, it’s normally for the people that are in the area; we pretty much know who they are,” said Rucker. “So it’s normally like a maximum of maybe 10 people that come in on Wednesdays. … I typically do that all the time, but now it has increased.”

While some restaurants have shuttered temporarily due to the pandemic, there are others with owners who plan to stay open for as long as they can. Those owned by African American women are getting crushed particularly hard as the economy reels from the new carryout/delivery/pickup-only reality. Restaurant owners are creating new ways to weather the pandemic.

Lexington Betty’s Smoke House co-owner Dominique Leach is no stranger to dealing with catastrophe.

Leach, a Humboldt Park native, started her business with a food truck — which was later set on fire. The pandemic has more recently caused her to shut down two locations on the South (the Pullman location reopened Friday) and West Sides (Austin), along with cutting back on hours when she reopened them.

“Unfortunately, this came at a time where we were really getting some recognition for our hard work,” said Leach. “And, you know, I can only be optimistic. And we’re just happy enough to be getting enough revenue to at least keep the bills paid We’ve come down from 14 employees to just myself, my wife, who’s the other owner, and one employee.

“We have one driver working with the helper with deliveries. … and it’s just enough to get by. And we’re happy to have that — it could be a lot worse. And so I’m going to take the positives and be optimistic about the future.”

During the pandemic, Lexington Betty’s Smoke House has donated meals to Rush University Medical Center employees and 5th District police officers.

“Just know that we’re all in this together, and when we reopen, we’ll celebrate with the community and we just hope to get everybody’s support. We’ll be here at the end of this,” said Leach.

Due to the pandemic, Annah Mitchell, owner of Gobble Doggs, a turkey hotdog-centric food truck, had to temporarily shutter her LaSalle Street Metra station kiosk and cease construction of a restaurant she planned to open. Last year, her business launched a scholarship — raising funds via tips — for young entrepreneurs.

With her truck temporarily out of service amid COVID-19, she’s made the pivot to driving for the online grocery delivery service Instacart, and taking orders for catering.

“I’ve been doing anything that I possibly can,” said Mitchell. “I certainly want to make sure that the business stays on people’s minds and we’re continuing to market the business.”

Mitchell is determined to not let the pandemic take her livelihood away.

“This is a self-financed business and so everything that I’ve put into this business is mine — the blood, the money, the sweat, the tears,” said Mitchell. “So when I look at everything that I have put on the line for this, I cannot lose. I refuse to lose; I can’t let this go. This means too much to me … I cannot let this go.”",real

As the double shock of coronavirus restrictions and dipping oil prices have plunged the world into the worst economic crunch in decades, Muslims embarked on Eid al-Fitr celebrations on Sunday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. In some locations, the festival, which traditionally unites whole families, relatives from far away, friends and neighbours, are set to be spent in a comparatively frugal way, given the authorities’ still effective stay-in instructions.

After a partial easing during Ramadan led to a sharp spike in infections, some countries - from Saudi Arabia to Egypt, Turkey, and Syria - moved to ban mass prayer gatherings, a highlight of the traditionally lavish celebrations, to limit the spread of the contagious COVID-19. For instance, Saudi Arabia, home to Islam's most holy sites, kicked off a five-day, round-the-clock curfew beginning on Saturday after infections more than quadrupled since Ramadan began to around 68,000 - the biggest tally among all Gulf countries.

At this unprecedented time, Eid prayers will be held at the two holy mosques in the cities of Mecca and Medina ""without worshippers"", a royal decree stated. Similarly, Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest site, will be closed over Eid, but will reopen to worshippers only after the holiday, according to the governing body. Iran, which has seen the Middle East's deadliest corona flare-ups, has called on its citizens to avoid travel over Eid as it battles to keep tabs on COVID rates.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said that the country had doubled down on its effort to avoid ""new peaks of the disease"" caused by people ""not respecting health regulations"".

Iran shut schools and places of worship and banned local travel over the Persian New Year holidays back in March, but the restrictions were recently eased, in the run-up to Eid, celebrated by both Sunnis and Shiites.

However, a great many, out of economic or personal reasons, voiced an intention to turn a deaf ear to the authorities’ instructions, with many issuing themselves fake passes in countries from Indonesia to Pakistan, to attend the conventional Eid fairs, or at least shop for gifts for their families, irrespective of fears corona rates would further soar.

""For over two months my children were homebound"", Ishrat Jahan, a mother of four, was quoted as saying by AFP, as she was seen at a bustling marketplace in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. ""This feast is for the kids, and if they can't celebrate it with new garments, there is no point in us working so hard throughout the year"", she added, as the country’s authorities are yet to decide on what measures to introduce throughout Eid.

Meanwhile, as many as 3,500 Tunisians who arrived back home just ahead of the holiday will have to spend it away from their families, under a two-week quarantine in airport hotels after arriving from abroad. Atef Maherzi, a doctor repatriated Tuesday from Saudi Arabia, said she would be feasting over Skype, with her husband meeting guests alone this time.

However, the dire times have inspired a group of Muslim comedians to launch a bit of visual entertainment, as mass gatherings have largely been given a no-go across nations.

Fourty Muslim performers from across the world agreed to host a virtual show on Sunday called ""The Socially Distant Eid Comedy Night”. Among Asian countries, Iran has been hit the most by the pandemic, with the total confirmed COVID-19 cases there topping 135,700, with India just behind (roughly 132,600), as of 24 May, per Johns Hopkins University estimates.",fake

Opinion contributor

My son was born at 6:57 a.m. Of course, I’m not the only parent who remembers the precise moment their child entered the world, but the reason that time sticks in my brain has as much to do with what else took place that morning. One hour and 49 minutes after his birth, the first plane hit the World Trade Center's North Tower.

His birth was unremarkable, thankfully, and once mother and son were comfortably relocated from the delivery room to their recovery room, I took advantage of the first lull of my morning to dash down to the hospital cafeteria to grab a breakfast sandwich and coffee to go. By the time the elevator had returned me to the 5th floor, a crowd had gathered around the small television mounted on the ceiling of the maternity wing vestibule.

On the screen a bright orange fire raged against the sharpest, bluest sky I had ever seen and people were murmuring, shifting from one foot to the other, glancing uncomfortably toward the window on the other side of the room. Nobody quite knew what was going on and what might happen next.

When the second plane hit 17 minutes later it brought, among other nightmarish things, a cold clarity. By the time I made it back to the recovery room, America had changed. The world my son had been born into, just two hours earlier, was gone.

Making sense of a shattered world

It was for this reason I decided to write my son a letter. I would describe the events of that day in the hope that years later, he would understand just a bit better the world he had been born into as well as the one he navigated through in the ensuing years. Each year on his birthday I would write another letter, summarizing both the accomplishments and milestones of his life achieved during the previous 12 months along with the goings-on in the larger world. I would, I told myself, present him with these letters all at once, 19 years later, in August 2020, when he was packing up for college.

When I made this decision, August 2020 seemed so far away. I couldn’t imagine we’d ever get there, although I knew it would arrive with a head of steam, carrying the detritus of what had been wrought the terrible morning of his birth that was still, nevertheless, a guiltily wonderful morning for my wife and me, despite it all. What would the world look like in 2020? Who could possibly know?

The fascination of finding out how we got from here to there was overwhelming for me, so I was determined to keep my promise to myself and write that letter every September 11th. And I did.

August 2020 doesn’t seem so far away right now. For my son, the excitement and anticipation brought by college acceptance letters have now been replaced with angst that he won’t be going away to college in late summer as planned but would instead be stuck in his childhood bedroom, faced with the unappetizing choice of either starting the next phase of his life on Zoom or deferring college completely until some indeterminate time in the future, a time that seems farther off every day.

Virtual classrooms, real-life lessons:All I really need to know in life I learned from my kid’s online kindergarten

After years of breathless waiting for this life-changing moment to arrive, he’s now hoping against hope that time slows down, allowing the world to settle and recover before snatching this moment away from him. Yes, I know that others have it worse and as long as we remain healthy we should count our blessings. We do. But that doesn’t mean we can’t mourn a loss that amounts to something short of death.

For years, America went off course

When I go through my collection of letters, I see with crystal clarity how, in fact, we got from there to here. On his first birthday, I told him about how he loved to crawl and play with our dog Clarence, but also about the Enron scandal and the collapse of the dot.com bubble. On his second birthday, right above the taped ticket stub of his first Phillies game, I mentioned the Iraq War and how the stock market had rebounded as a result. The Dow had risen from 8611 in my '02 letter to 9420 in my '03 letter. War, it seemed, was good business.

My '04 letter focused largely on the birth of our daughter and my son’s cool reception to the reality that the spotlight was no longer his alone. It also remarked on the fact that “the Bush administration has succeeded in so thoroughly scaring the hell out of the American public that they’ll believe anything done in the name of national security, even if it makes no sense.” It also noted that Donald Trump’s “The Apprentice” was the breakout television hit of the year.

Each year’s letter provided another link in the chain. Then-Sen. John Kerry, running as a peacenik in '04, had no shot to stop another four years of President George W. Bush’s militarization of America, I wrote. In '05 I wrote that Hurricane Katrina showed us just how unprepared we were as a nation to handle a calamity. Worse, as the messes in both the Middle East and New Orleans grew, we watched the truth become little more than a pawn to be played in a game with monumental stakes.

“The sad thing about America since you were born,” I wrote to my son on Sept. 11, 2006, “is that many people no longer trust anything that is told to us.” And on and on.

Restrictions aren't always safe:A century after Prohibition, will the coronavirus finally end it? We'll drink to that.

On the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I wrote that the day was commemorated with Stealth fighter jets flying over football stadiums and overheated praise of the armed forces. “There was a lot of talk about the ‘heroes’ of 9/11 but not much about who these heroes actually were,” I wrote. “What 9/11 stands for, if anything, continues to be open to debate.” It was a confusing day, I admitted. Nobody knew what to do or what to say. So our nation decided to laud the military in the desperate hope that it would protect us from any future catastrophe. Defense expenditures exploded along with the praise, as countless other governmental functions were marginalized, if not ignored or dismantled completely.

Now we know that the military couldn’t protect us from everything. A virus is impervious to multimillion dollar fighter jets — but perhaps not to a fully functional and funded federal government well-staffed with medical and scientific experts. They might have prevented this world, shattered on the day of my son’s birth, from disintegrating into dust under his feet once again, this time upon the occasion of his high school graduation.

My son was born on 9/11 and will now graduate high school in his bedroom in the midst of the most horrific global pandemic of our lifetimes. The world broke on the day of his birth, and the fissures from that day caused it to crack wide open right before he was to head off to college. And I have the letters to prove it.

Updated at 9:11 p.m. ET

With the number of cases worldwide of the novel coronavirus surpassing 150,000, with some 6,000 deaths, governments across the globe continue their struggle to contain the pandemic. Their hope is to limit the number of new infections, while treating those individuals suffering from COVID-19 and isolating others whose symptoms are not as severe but who might spread the disease.

Here's a snapshot by region of what is happening as of midday Monday:

Europe

The European Union is proposing that its members restrict nonessential travel to the EU for 30 days.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said there would be exemptions for long-term EU residents, family members of EU nationals, diplomats and people actively working to address the crisis, such as doctors and researchers.

The proposal also would exempt people transporting goods, with ""fast lanes"" at borders ""giving priority to essential transport."" EU leaders are expected to discuss the proposal Tuesday, according to Reuters.

The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said over the weekend that Europe had become the new epicenter of the pandemic after it peaked earlier in Asia.

""More cases are now being reported [in Europe] every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,"" Tedros said at a news conference at the WHO's Geneva headquarters.

Officials in Italy have reported some 3,600 new cases and 368 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections there to nearly 25,000 and some 1,800 deaths. Italy is second in the number of reported infections and deaths only to China, where the epidemic was first identified in December.

Italian officials have expressed concern that the surge in infections has pushed the country's health system to the saturation point, according to NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. Health authorities say there is a severe lack of intensive care unit beds, ventilators and protective masks to treat the huge influx.

""It's not a wave — it's a tsunami,"" Dr. Robert Rona, who is in charge of intensive care at Monza hospital outside Milan, told The Associated Press.

The disease first appeared in Lombardy, the region that is home to Milan, a metropolis of 3 million people that is Italy's economic powerhouse. It started in a cluster of small-to-medium-size towns in the region, and Poggioli reports that ""everything is being done to prevent a surge in cases in Milan.""

Spain, where the government formally declared a state of emergency over the weekend, ordered a lockdown — requiring people to stay home to foster social distancing and for all nonessential shops to close, along with restaurants, bars, cafes and movie theaters.

In Spain, the total number of confirmed infections now exceeds 7,800 cases with 282 deaths.

Following a lengthy briefing on Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, whose wife has tested positive for the virus, said ""extraordinary"" decisions were required to combat the disease.

""From now, we enter a new phase,"" he said. ""We won't hesitate in doing what we need [to do] to beat the virus.""

""During the state of emergency, people will only be allowed out on to public streets for the following reasons: to buy food, basic or pharmaceutical items; to attend medical centers; to go to and from work; to look after children, older people or those with disabilities or who are especially vulnerable; and to attend financial or insurance offices on force majeure grounds,"" Sánchez said, according to The Guardian newspaper.

In a gesture of gratitude for doctors, nurses and other medical workers who work in Spain's national health system, people went to their balconies all over the country at 10 p.m. local time to applaud in unison.

In France, municipal elections went ahead as planned on Sunday under what officials said were tight sanitary restrictions, including ""safe spacing"" of voters as they queued and providing hand sanitizer. There have been nearly 5,500 total confirmed cases in France, with 127 deaths from COVID-19. Despite assurances that the polling was safe, the Interior Ministry on Sunday reported turnout was just 18.3%, down 5% from elections six years ago.

France has already ordered a lockdown similar to the one Italy and Spain have imposed.

In the United Kingdom, where nearly 1,400 cases have been confirmed so far with 35 deaths from the coronavirus disease, no lockdown has been ordered.

However, the government is expected to lay out emergency measures this week, including requiring people 70 years and older to self-isolate for as long as four months.

Last week, the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson signaled that it might be considering a different approach to the rest of the world — in essence, allowing a large percentage of the population to become infected, creating a ""herd immunity"" that would eventually stamp out the epidemic.

But public backlash to that suggestion, which would result in tens of millions of Britons becoming infected with the virus, forced the government to backtrack.

""We will do the right thing at the right time, based on the best available science,"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote in an opinion piece that appeared in The Telegraph over the weekend. ""Herd immunity is not our goal or policy, it's a scientific concept.""

Nearly 7,300 cases and 17 deaths have been reported in Germany, and some 2,200 infections and 14 deaths have been reported in Switzerland. The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Belgium each have over 1,000 cases.

Asia

New cases in China, where the epidemic began, have been decreasing steadily in recent weeks, with just 27 new cases reported in the WHO's latest situation report, which is updated every 24 hours. It is a long way from the peak of the crisis in China about a month ago, when Beijing reported more than 14,000 new infections in a single day. A total of about 81,000 cases have been reported there since December.

In recent days, the country has begun shifting its efforts from the internal spread of the virus to keeping new cases from abroad from entering.

The number of new cases is also in decline in South Korea and Japan — two countries that were hard hit as the infection spilled over from China in the early days of the epidemic. Seoul reported 76 new cases and Japan 64, according to WHO.

Although government officials have refrained from critiquing the rest of the world's response to the pandemic, some hospital officials haven't been as reticent.

Zhang Wenhong, director of the infectious diseases department at Shanghai Huashan Hospital affiliated with Fudan University, wrote on the hospital's social media account: ""We had thought the world would synchronise controls with those taken in China – in the way that Singapore, Japan and South Korea have done.""

""But Europe has become the new epicentre and brought us huge uncertainties,"" he wrote, according to the South China Morning Post.

Indonesia, a country whose health minister said last week was free of coronavirus, attributing its good fortune to prayer, now reports 134 cases and five deaths.

Middle East

In Iran, where the epidemic has infected nearly 15,000 people by official accounts, a 78-year-old member of the clerical body that chooses the country's supreme leader has reportedly died from COVID-19. The virus has killed some 800 people in Iran, but suspicions about the government's assessment of the epidemic within its borders has led some to question the official statistics as understated.

Elsewhere in the region, Qatar has reported more than 400 cases but no deaths; Bahrain has more than 200 cases, with one reported death; and Kuwait says it has more than 100 confirmed cases, but no deaths.

A number of cases have been reported in a dozen other countries in the eastern Mediterranean.

Canada and Latin America

In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the country will restrict entry for travelers who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents.

He said there would be exemptions for several groups, including U.S. citizens, airplane crews, diplomats, and the immediate family members of Canadian citizens.

""I know that these measures are far-reaching. They are exceptional circumstances calling for exceptional measures,"" he said.

Trudeau and his family say they are self-isolating after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for the coronavirus. The country has had more than 400 cases, with four deaths.

Last week, the press secretary to Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro tested positive for the virus after having met with President Trump at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. About 200 cases have been reported in Brazil, but no deaths.

Africa

The continent of Africa, which faced the brunt of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, appears thus far to have been largely spared from COVID-19. According to Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering, South Africa has had 62 cases, but no deaths, while Algeria has had 54 confirmed cases and four deaths; Senegal has had 24 cases and no deaths.

Prior pandemics have played a critical role in molding the way humans live; and the current coronavirus pandemic will be no exception. Jon Wertheim takes a look at some of the possible changes in store on the next edition of 60 Minutes, Sunday, May 17 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.



The way society is dealing with the pandemic today has its origins in past plagues, says Frank Snowden, a professor emeritus of history at Yale and author of ""Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.""



""They had quarantine. They had social distancing… lockdowns,"" Snowden tells Wertheim. ""Doctors actually wore PPE. And what they had was a mask. We know about that. Theirs was differently shaped. It had a long beak. And they put sweet-smelling herbs in it to keep the foul odors away.""



The plagues led to modern ways of life, now basic to society, says Snowden. ""They introduced sewer systems, toilets… set housing regulations, paved streets. So the hygiene of modern cities that we see today was built, in large part, on the sanitary measures that grew out of the terrible experience of Asiatic cholera.""



Changes to come from this pandemic may include new health care initiatives to remedy the failure of society to be prepared for the coronavirus and its disproportionate rate of infection and death among the poor. Different places and different ages have experienced the horror of the virus in different ways. An entire generation of students sit in a kind of virtual detention, unsure when and how they will graduate or restart school.



Renowned Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who wrote a defining account on the COVID-19 crisis, has some analogies. ""Right now it feels as though we have no present? We have a past. And we have a future. And right now we're in some sort of transit lounge,"" she says. ""We should not be trying to stitch them together without thinking about that rupture? I think the most profound thing is the rupture of the idea of touch, the idea of proximity. All these things will become so laden with risk and fear for a long, long time.""



Speaking to Wertheim from Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, she describes the blue skies the city's lockdown has brought, on account of fewer emissions. That is encouragement to environmentalist Bill McKibben. ""Flatten another curve. Flatten the carbon curve too… if we did that, then people might look back in 50 years at this time and thank us, instead of curse us,"" he tells Wertheim.



The dominant economic model of society is being tested by the pandemic, says McKibben. ""We've spent the last 75-- 100 years really fixated in our country and increasingly around the world, on economic growth as the reason for all being,"" McKibben says. ""And… at least for a while, that worked out pretty well. A lot of people were pulled out of poverty. But we've begun to sense the limits of that too. That's why the temperature keeps rising,"" he says.



McKibben says it would be foolish to waste this crisis. ""Well, what choice does one have, really, in a crisis but to try and make something useful of it? I mean, the dumbest thing to do would just be to set up all the pins in the bowling alley one more time exactly the same way,"" he tells Wertheim.",real

UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said that he would bet a million dollars that Euro 2020 will be played in 2021, when asked by the Guardian, saying that he ""doesn't know why it wouldn't be"" and expressing hopes that the coronavirus pandemic will not last forever.

""Yes, I would […] I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think"", Ceferin said, when asked about the possible bet.

He also said that he is personally sure that football with fans in attendance will return very soon.

""I don’t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave […] people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today? I don’t think so. We are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but I’m absolutely sure, personally, that good old football with fans will come back very soon"", he stated.

Ceferin complained that he has experienced a sleeping disorder amid the current pandemic and its impact on the world and on football, noting that ""there is a lot of work still to be done"". Due to the huge amount of information and the realization that ""dozens of millions of dollars"" will be lost due to the lockdowns caused by the pandemic, ""it is hard to fall asleep at night"" the influential sports executive said.

In March, UEFA pushed the 2020 tournament to 2021 because of the lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic that has already claimed over 320,000 lives globally. The championship is planned to become the first to be played in 12 stadiums in 12 countries, not in just in one country or two neighbouring states.

The COVID-19 lockdowns also resulted in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the NBA season, Italy's football championship and all other major sporting events to be postponed.",fake

NO PLANES, FEW TRAINS, SOME AUTOMOBILES — With planes half full and roads emptier than ever, an unusual Memorial Day weekend looms. Instead of kicking off the summer travel season, this year's holiday serves mostly as an object lesson for just how much the coronavirus has shredded the modes that people use to move around.

“Every year, Memorial Day looks the same. It will not look the same in very many places this year,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on the Senate floor this week. That includes the people it will honor, who this year extend beyond fallen soldiers to Covid first responders.

For the first time in 20 years, the AAA offered no official Memorial Day travel forecast, citing the unpredictability caused by Covid-19. But the organization did offer a dismal outlook, saying it anticipates the lowest amount of traffic on planes, trains and automobiles in modern history. This year’s travel is likely to be a record low, said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel.

Airlines for America data shows 73 percent of flights last week were less than half full, although a very slight uptick in bookings from an April nadir offers a speck of hope. Airlines have encouraged passengers to keep flying by instituting a patchwork of safety measures. But new TSA screening figures show passengers screened at checkpoints down more than 90 percent from a year ago.

The overall picture for the travel sector— for finances and employment — is ugly. Fresh U.S. Travel Association estimates show Memorial Day spending this year will be $4.2 billion, a third of the $12.3 billion spent in 2019. And 51 percent of the travel sector’s 15.8 million employees are unemployed, more than double the rate seen during the worst year of the Great Depression.

Airports, state transportation departments, transit agencies and tolling authorities are all asking Congress for more money to make up for revenue that has dropped precipitously as people stay home. The latest House bill proposed $15.75 billion in grants to public transit systems, most of that for urban areas with populations over 3 million and $4 billion for transit agencies more broadly.

Road travel could be first to recover, with all states having eased stay-at-home orders, at least somewhat, and beaches and parks reopening in patches. Some beach counties have seen a 200 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled since a low point around Easter, according to transportation analytics company Streetlight Data.

The uptick is worrying however, with reports of long lines of cars and crowding in some parks and beaches. House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) pressed the Interior Department to exercise “extreme caution” in reopening national parks last week.

Even a relative surge in traffic, however, isn’t likely to match typical crowds. New York State Thruway Authority data for exit plazas on the roads it maintains shows that in April 2019, 12.867 million trips were taken. A year later there were about half as many trips, POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney found by analyzing the authority’s database. Safety groups expect the Memorial Day weekend, typically one of the deadliest periods for driving annually, to be the safest on the roads in years.

Gas will be cheap, too: The national average as of the end of this week was $1.92 per gallon.

A message from PhRMA: While America’s biopharmaceutical companies are working around the clock to develop a treatment for COVID-19, companies are also expanding efforts to help patients access other medicines they need. PhRMA’s Medicine Assistance Tool was built to connect patients with resources that may help lower out-of-pocket costs.

First In Nightly

OFFICE POLITICS — After three weeks in the Capitol, the Senate has not turned into the coronavirus cluster that some feared. At least one staffer has tested positive, forcing Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) into quarantine. But everyone’s worst fears have not been realized, Congress reporters Burgess Everett and Marianne LeVine write. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is feeling increasingly comfortable that his plan to bring back the Senate is paying off, so much so that he likened Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) plan to allow some remote voting to “ballot harvesting” in a phone call with House Republicans this week, according to a source familiar with the call.

Whether it was worth it to fly in 100 senators, many elderly and at higher risk of coronavirus, has become almost an entirely partisan question. Democrats say the GOP focus on stocking the judiciary and Trump administration with conservatives — while declining to approve coronavirus relief — is a waste of time that endangers everyone that keeps the building running, from maintenance workers to food workers to the police that guard the Capitol around the clock.

But to McConnell and Senate Republicans trying to defend their majority, it’s just one more step toward normalcy.

Palace Intrigue

LET THERE BE LIGHT — Trump today commanded America's governors to immediately reopen churches and other places of worship shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic, threatening to ""override"" state leaders if they refused to follow his directive. (It’s unclear whether he has the legal authority to do so.) The CDC issued guidance for houses of worship trying to reopen, deeming them essential services. Public health officials have raised concerns about the risks of in-person religious services, but Trump was aiming to win over religious groups who’ve been less than pleased with his handling of the pandemic.

White House reporter Gabby Orr writes that Trump’s standing with the Christian right is triggering alarm bells inside his reelection campaign. Top aides have long banked on expanding the president’s evangelical base as a key part of their strategy for victory this November. A pair of surveys by reputable outfits earlier this month found waning confidence in the administration’s coronavirus response among key religious groups, with a staggering decline in the president’s favorability among white evangelicals and white Catholics. Both are crucial constituencies that supported Trump by wide margins in 2016. If their turnout shrinks this fall, it could sink his reelection prospects.



From the Health Desk

TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS — Results of new studies today signaled progress on work toward a Covid vaccine and therapeutics. Results from another provided damning evidence against a drug Trump has boosted (and that he says he’s been taking for the last two weeks).

Promising outlook: A trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine developed in China indicates it's safe and produces virus-specific antibodies and T cells, health care reporter Ashleigh Furlong writes. However, the authors warn that the results, published in the Lancet, must be “interpreted cautiously.” A New England Journal of Medicine study also found remdesivir “was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19.”

Warning signs: A large observational study showed no evidence that the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine treats the coronavirus, but it showed the possibility for harm. Health care reporter Rachel Roubein writes that the study involving 96,000 patients, also published in Lancet, found that using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was linked to increased rates of mortality and heart rhythm complications among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The researchers suggested that the drugs shouldn’t be used to treat coronavirus patients outside of clinical trials for now — the same advice several medical groups have given. Trump said this week he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, and that the “great” and “powerful” drug showed “some very strong signs” of fighting the virus.

Mea culpa — In Thursday’s edition, we misstated the timeline for positive Covid-19 test results. Three or four weeks could pass from the moment someone is exposed to the virus to when a state logs a positive test result.

WHAT A WEEK — Matt Wuerker goes through the week that was in cartoons, memes and other satire in the latest edition of Punchlines, covering the discussion around “Obamagate,” masks and hydroxychloroquine.

The Global Fight

VOICES OF THE CRISIS — Around the world, while some people remain in lockdown, many are starting on the road to reopening their homes, businesses and lives. The latest episode of POLITICO Dispatch talks to people the world over about how the pandemic, and the move to reestablish old patterns, has affected them. Some of their thoughts: ”I’m tired of being scared of other people.” “I think I’m angry because my illusion of control is completely shattered.” And “Maybe my biggest worry is that we as a civilization won’t learn anything from this pandemic.”



Parting Words

BAD RECEPTION — At the end of April, your host gave in to the inevitable: The long-ago scheduled May 30 wedding reception wasn’t going to happen. My husband and I got married at the Travis County Courthouse on April Fool’s Day (also Easter Sunday) two years ago. We wanted to wait for the big party with friends and family until after he was done with law school. The event included a rehearsal dinner on a boat in downtown Austin and a short (ha!) Hindu ceremony performed by a family friend. By March, we knew a wedding would be impossible, but it wasn’t until the end of April that we sat down to write a note to our friends announcing the party was off. (My husband then spent the next few weeks buying himself pots and pans from our registry.)

We’re not the only ones. Memorial Day kicks off the summer wedding season, but many couples are rethinking their nuptials, dealing a financial blow to the $74 billion wedding industry. In some states, like Texas, event restrictions have lightened up. But wedding worries have entered a whole new era, with feuding relatives or a too-drunk party guest giving way to fear of hosting a super spreader event. About 450,000 weddings were scheduled in the U.S. in March, April and May of this year. Unlike us, about 96 percent of couples are postponing their celebrations, according to a March survey from wedding website The Knot.

Your host spoke with event planner Bryan Rafanelli, who planned ceremonies for Chelsea Clinton and Matt Damon and seven state dinners for the Obamas, about social distance dancing and why Fridays are the new Saturdays. This interview has been edited.

Are you planning any weddings this year?

Every project I have in 2020 has been postponed or canceled. Of 78 events this year, I still have nine left in the fall. I am doing my niece’s wedding on Sept. 12. She is the only wedding we’re moving forward with. She very much wants to have a family, so she is like, I don’t want to wait.

Any high-profile clients?

I can’t say, but you’re onto something there. This has affected everybody.

How will your niece’s wedding look?

She decided that she would do a small family wedding for 60 people and then they are going to do their big celebration next year. My wedding gift to them is the flowers and linens. I’m laughing, but I’m crying. My niece’s wedding is going to be a lunch, no dancing of course. We’re talking with the country club about a 200-person ballroom that will have 60 people in it. It’s probably good that it’s my niece, so I can be honest and straightforward.

Any virtual weddings or events?

I certainly have with my nonprofit work. But not private events, not other than my mother’s 85th birthday, which was fun. I’m testing my family with all these schemes!

How has Covid affected your business and industry?

I furloughed half my staff. I think I can weather this storm, although even I am looking at between October and next April and thinking, ""Wow those will be really interesting months.""

These are a lot of two- to five-person shops, whether you are a stationery provider or a wedding cake provider or a photographer. I have a friend in the music business, and he had 363 dates canceled, those are bands or trios he provides for cocktail parties or wedding ceremonies. Most wedding cake bakeries — if they push out five cakes a weekend it’s a big deal. My business is just really, really slammed.

If everyone is postponing to next year, does that mean we will see more people get married on a day other than Saturday?

In 2021, there are just so many dates. But in our industry to get into the New York Public Library or the Met, some of these coveted locations that you want to get married in, people have shifted to Fridays and Sundays. People are going to be so happy to celebrate family occasions, they will say Friday, let’s do it. Now you could leave for a Friday wedding and not have to give up a day of work because you are working virtually. That’s the silver lining.

How will weddings change at least in the short term?

There will definitely not be buffets, no more shared plates. I’m so thrilled about that part. No more family style, you just can’t. For my niece’s wedding, the lunch is going to be this beautiful box lunch. There will be individual containers for cocktail parties for the hors d'oeuvres. Mini champagne splits and rosé in a can — those are going to be super popular. We’ve been working with hotels to lay out dance floors to say this is what six feet apart looks like. It seems weird, but maybe?

The initial diagnosis is just the start of the staff’s work, though. What comes next is the arduous task of tracking down every person that patient may have encountered, a time-tested public health practice known commonly as contact tracing.

Though local and state officials have said that process is key to slowing the pandemic and reopening the state, a large-scale initiative hasn’t been announced to address the daunting task of tracking down every person who has come into contact with the growing number of COVID-19 patients. On Wednesday, 2,253 new cases were reported across Illinois as the total number of cases eclipsed 50,000.

One day per patient

Dr. John Schneider, a University of Chicago faculty member who serves as the Howard Brown clinic’s medical director, explained that a single staff member requires around a full day to call an infected person’s entire chain of direct and indirect contacts. That web of connections typically consists of roughly 10 people, most of whom haven’t even been around the original patient.

While roughly two-thirds of those contacts wind up testing positive, Schneider said close contacts living with an infected person are even more likely to come down with the disease. Facing a deadly virus that can spread insidiously to carriers who don’t show symptoms, contact tracers must move swiftly to interrupt the chain of infection.

“There’s definitely cases where we’ve observed that if we had intervened a couple days earlier, we could’ve prevented transmission events,” said Schneider, whose team consists of 15 contact tracers and three “data people.”

Schneider believes the state has been slow to launch a larger effort and holds that getting a contact tracing system in place is vital for responding to the current outbreak and a possible resurgence in a few months.

“I really think it’s about doing the best we can now, knowing it’s not going to be perfect,” he said.

State system a work in progress, gov says

Officials haven’t said how many people will be needed to ramp up contact tracing statewide.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that state officials were still trying to “spin up” a system, which he said is “a very large endeavor” that requires both hiring and technology. And Illinois Department of Public Health Director Ngozi Ezike alluded to a large-scale deployment of contact tracers in an interview last week with the New Yorker, saying thousands would likely be needed across the state.

In addition to traditional community outreach, Chicago Public Health Commissioner Allison Arwady said Tuesday that an app rolled out by the city earlier this week to offer coronavirus-related assistance and allow Chicagoans to pre-register for a vaccine could ultimately be used for contact tracing.

“That kind of technology would be a total game-changer here,” Lightfoot said about similar technology being developed in Germany.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted”

Limited tracing taking place already

For now, public health workers in Chicago and Cook County are already conducting limited contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.

The county was employing 29 contact tracers as of April 16, including four dedicated to congregate settings like nursing homes and the Cook County Jail. Meanwhile, the city’s current contact tracing efforts are also focused on those types of facilities.

As a result, investigators from both departments sometimes collect the same information, which is then routed to a statewide system state officials use to track cases. According to Schneider, it can actually be useful to have multiple tracers reaching out to a single person.

“We’ve learned that when people get multiple folks calling them, they’re more likely to engage or to be contacted,” he said. “You don’t wanna be completely inefficient but some overlap is okay.”

Private firm recruiting in Chicago

In recent days, a Washington, D.C.-based recruitment firm that launched just a week ago has started hiring contact tracers in Chicago and other major cities. Contrace Public Health Corps ultimately hopes to recruit 20,000 workers nationwide by May 15, the company’s founder and CEO Steve Waters said in an interview.

“Contact tracing is the largest US civilian mobilization since World War II,” the company says in its job postings, which advertise pay of $17-22 an hour.

Waters said the newly-minted company has not been contracted by any government agencies in Illinois. Instead, applicants from Chicago will likely be hired by a local employment agency or nonprofit, who he said will prioritize the hiring of residents with “an understanding of local geography and culture.”

“Our model is based on the premise that as we are not operating as a traditional recruiting company,” said Waters. “We can help local and state agencies and nonprofits stand up contact tracing efforts, at scale, much more quickly and at a much, much lower cost than traditional recruiters.”",real

The Tuscaloosa News

Work on the ongoing Bryant-Denny Stadium construction project at the University of Alabama was briefly suspended last weekend after an undisclosed number of workers had positive tests for the coronavirus. Work resumed Monday, according to the project’s chief contractor, the Montgomery-based Caddell Construction Company.

""The safety of all of our employees and trade partners is our top priority,"" Caddell said in a statement to The Tuscaloosa News on Tuesday night. ""In addition to adhering to all established protocols to protect our workers, Caddell restricted operations over the past weekend after receiving notice of positive tests among some employees and trade partners. This allowed us to engage in additional deep-cleaning and provide testing by an independent laboratory so all of our team members could be cleared before returning to the job site.

""Our processes meet and/or exceed OSHA and CDC guidelines. We will continue to act on the latest guidance and information to promote the health and safety of our essential workforce.""

The statement did not specify the number of cases at the site.

The school also issued a statement to The News indicating it had ""provided sanitation supplies ... and personal protection equipment"" to all contractors.

""From the start of the pandemic, UA has continuously mandated that our campus contractors take all necessary steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said the statement from the university's Office of Strategic Communications. ""The contractors immediately adapted operations and processes, engaged in heightened cleaning and took other protective measures for the health and safety of their employees. The University directly provided sanitation supplies, thermometers and signage at all construction sites, and made personal protective equipment available to all contractors. Those processes, which have been in place since early March, are continuously refined based on the latest guidance from state, federal and industry leaders in order to protect the health and safety of the campus community.”

Work on the $92.5 million first phase of renovation began in November. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne said in a video Q&A last week that construction was ""on schedule"" despite a January accident in which two workers were injured by falling beams.

Alabama’s first home game is scheduled for Sept. 12 against Georgia State, although the ongoing coronavirus pandemic could affect either the dates of games or the presence of fans in the stadium for games.",real
1135,892,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-children-inflammatory-disease-link-kawasaki-disease-doctors-italy/,2020-05-14,Doctors in Italy find link between rare inflammatory disease in children and COVID-19,"Rome — Italian doctors say they've got the first scientific evidence linking the coronavirus to a rare but deadly inflammatory disease in children. The condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in more than a dozen states across the U.S., including Louisiana, Mississippi, California and New York. Over 100 children have been affected in New York alone, three of whom died, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Doctors had suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction, but there was no clear proof that the two were linked.

Reported in The Lancet medical journal, the new evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the epicenter of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy, where the nationwide reported death toll is more than 30,000, behind only Britain and the United States.

Doctors at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital compared a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare condition in children called Kawasaki disease, finding a 30-fold increase in cases of Kawasaki-like disease in patients between February and April.

The acceleration of cases occurred at a pace of about one every three months, indicating a cluster that was fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, especially, the authors noted, since overall hospital admissions were much lower than usual during national stay-at-home orders.

""Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,"" said Dr. Lorenzo D'Antiga, director of child health at the hospital, in The Guardian.

None of the 10 children in Bergamo died, but the authors reported that their symptoms were much more severe than those of the children with Kawasaki disease. Heart complications were more common, as were lower counts of platelets. A type of white blood cell typical of coronavirus patients was also more prevalent.

Five of the children experienced shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki patients.

The researchers also highlighted that eight of the 10 children tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that the children had been infected with the virus weeks earlier. They suspect that the two other children may have been false negatives, due to imperfect tests.

While Kawasaki disease tends to strike infants and preschoolers, the 10 children with the mysterious disorder were generally several years older. The average age of the Kawasaki patients was 3; the average age of the children with this condition was 7 and a half.

The doctors warn that the ""strong association"" between the coronavirus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account as governments around the world ease lockdown restrictions.

But they also stressed that the disorder is exceedingly rare, diagnosed in no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. Only a small fraction require intensive care, and even fewer die.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will soon issue an alert asking doctors to report cases of children with symptoms of the syndrome.",real
1140,71,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21178376/activists-phones-online-coronavirus-protests,2020-03-13,Activists pick up their phones and move online as coronavirus curbs protests,"Activists prepping for a rally that was supposed to take place yesterday on Wall Street thought they were being careful. They would stand a few feet away from each other while protesting a potential bailout for fossil fuel companies amid the economic disaster unfolding along with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Then came a flood of unexpected news the evening before the protest: classes were canceled to keep people from passing the virus to one another, President Trump announced a travel ban, Tom Hanks became the first A-list celebrity to test positive for the virus. The last straw for the activists was the NBA suspending its season.

Mass protests are indefinitely on hold

“That was a big shocker to some of us who are big sports fans,” says Pete Sikora, climate campaigns director for New York Communities for Change, an advocacy group leading the protest. “That drove home how big a deal this is.” So they canceled, about 12 hours before the rally was set to start.

Mass protests are indefinitely on hold, some grassroots groups say, amid efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Groups like the Sunrise Movement — which had also planned to join the Wall Street rally — are turning to online activism and phone banking to keep momentum going. Sunrise, which has pushed for a Green New Deal by occupying the offices of ranking Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, tells The Verge that it is postponing all of its mass mobilizations and in-person trainings until further notice.

The restrictions come at a crucial time when many community organizers would normally be in full gear. It’s election season, so they’re working to mobilize voters and sway presidential candidates’ positions. There’s also distrust in the Trump administration’s ability to respond to the crisis. During previous disasters like hurricanes, people have been able to express their frustration with a botched response through protests. But the coronavirus pandemic means that doing the same now could do more harm than good. And some activists worry that the public health crisis will make situations worse for the communities they represent.

“The thing that really kind of captures public outrage is mass protests in the streets and so we’re going to be fighting with one hand tied behind our back,” says Sikora, whose organization also works on housing and criminal justice reform.

His group is figuring out ways to protect New Yorkers who might be disproportionately vulnerable to the pandemic and its economic fallout. As businesses slow and lay off workers, there’s more pressure on people trying to make ends meet. New York Communities for Change wants to stop evictions in the state so that people aren’t thrown out of their homes at a time when they’re supposed to stay home to keep healthy. It’s also calling for pardons or sentence reductions for elderly inmates, since prisons are susceptible to outbreaks and seniors inside could be sitting ducks.

Here's the thing, y'all. #coronavirus and #COVID19 are an #environmentaljustice issue. Where do you think thousands of elders with compromised immune systems, respiratory and heart diseases, and other so-called ""co-morbidities"" caused by pollution + racism w ""higher risk"" live? — Juliana Pino ️‍ (@julianapino) March 11, 2020

Sikora says his organization has been puzzling its way through the rapidly changing situation just like everyone else. They might turn to online petitions and webinars, or will ask people to take pictures to post online as a form of protest. The group’s office has temporarily closed and its staff are working remotely starting today.

The Sunrise Movement is asking people stuck at home to use their time to call prospective voters. They’re trying to turn out votes for congressional candidates that they’ve endorsed in the Midwest. They’re also campaigning hard for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has championed a Green New Deal. With Joe Biden now ahead of Sanders, it’s crunch time for the next round of Democratic primaries on March 17th.

Sunrise had put their hopes in college students boosting their candidates — but those students may not be on campus now that classes have been suspended. To get young voters to the polls, Sunrise is organizing phone banks; they’re also floating the idea of coordinating video conferences so that they can still sort of be together while making calls separately from home. It’s a shift in strategy from their previous focus on talking with people as they knocked door to door.

it’s crunch time

“Of course it is more difficult to mobilize in person for the Green New Deal because we need to take care of each other in this moment, not exposing each other to unnecessary risk,” says Sofie Karasek, a spokesperson for Sunrise. Making the call not to move forward with public rallies was an “emotionally difficult decision, especially when people put so much hard work into making these mobilizations happen and preparing.”

A major 3-day strike coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in April will no longer take place — at least not in person — a coalition of environmental groups announced this afternoon. “Instead, we will think creatively about how to disrupt business as usual,” the coalition tweeted.

Greta Thunberg, who inspired youth around the world to demand action on climate change by hitting the streets, tweeted earlier this week asking people to stay home. “Keep your numbers low but your spirits high and let’s take one week at the time,” she said. Thunberg urged people to join a digital strike by posting photos online with the hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline. The call has already been met with a flood of young people posting photos with protest signs from their homes.

Other groups are still figuring out how to navigate the new realities of living through a pandemic. “No decisions have been made yet but the organization is taking [COVID-19] very seriously,” a spokesperson for March For Our Lives, the youth gun violence prevention movement sparked by the Parkland, Florida high school shooting, emailed The Verge. “We are developing a plan on how to move forward with our planned demonstrations, digital activism, and working with our various members and chapters across the country to ensure we continue to work towards ending gun violence in America,” the spokesperson said.

The new outbreaks — and the fears of a second wave of contagion — underscored the dangers authorities face as they try to reopen their economies.

Around the world, the U.S. and other hard-hit countries are wrestling with how to ease curbs on business and public activity without causing the virus to come surging back.

Elsewhere, Belarus, which has not locked down despite increasing case numbers, saw tens of thousands of people turn out to mark Victory Day, the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in 1945. That was in contrast to Russia, which skipped the usual grand parade in Red Square.

Germany and South Korea have both carried out extensive testing and contact tracing and have been hailed for avoiding the mass deaths that have overwhelmed other countries. But even there, authorities have struggled with finding the balance between saving lives and saving jobs.

In South Korea, where a decline in new cases had prompted the government to loosen up, Seoul shut down thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to clubgoers who went out last weekend as the country relaxed its social-distancing guidelines.

Many of the infections were linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three nightclubs before testing positive. Mayor Park Won-soon said health workers were trying to contact some 1,940 people who had been at the three clubs and other places nearby.

The mayor said gains made against the virus are now threatened “because of a few careless people.”

Health officials in Germany faced outbreaks at three slaughterhouses in what was seen as a test of the government’s strategy for dealing with any resurgence of the virus as the restrictions are eased. At one slaughterhouse, in Coesfeld, 180 workers tested positive for the virus.

Germany’s NGG union, which represents food industry workers, said the outbreaks were the result of “a sick system.” Freddy Adjan, a senior union official, said the meat industry has for years been relying on “dubious subcontractors” that exploit workers.

U.S. authorities are likewise watching for a second wave, more than two weeks after states began gradually reopening, with Georgia largely leading the way.

Meanwhile, governments came under fresh scrutiny over their handling of the crisis.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Europe must acknowledge that it “wasn’t well-prepared” for the outbreak. In the U.S., internal government emails obtained by The Associated Press show that a decision to shelve detailed advice from the nation’s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the epidemic came from the highest levels of the White House.

Worldwide, the virus is confirmed to have infected over 3.9 million people and killed more than 275,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University based on data reported by governments.

Hard-hit Italy saw people return to the streets for their traditional aperitivos and revel in fine weather as restrictions there eased. In some cases, people went too far for the authorities.

Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala warned that “a handful of crazy people’’ were putting the city’s economic recovery at risk, and threatened to shut down the city’s trendy Navigli district after crowds of young Milanese were seen out at aperitivo hour ignoring social-distancing rules.

In Rome, the Campo dei Fiori flower and vegetable market was bustling Saturday morning, the first weekend Italians were allowed outside for more than just work and necessities. The Campo piazza, long a center of nightlife, has also come back to life at the evening aperitivo hour.

But confusion about what is now allowed and what is not created frustration for business owners.

Carlo Alberto, owner of the TabaCafe, an Argentine empanada bar that was selling cocktails to a few customers Friday, said that since reopening this week he had been threatened with a fine by the police because of the crowds that had formed in front of his bar.

“Am I supposed to send them home? They need a guard here to do that,” he said. “The laws aren’t clear, the decree isn’t clear. You don’t know what you can do.”

Elsewhere, Pakistan allowed shops, factories, construction sites and some other businesses to reopen Saturday, while more than 1,600 new cases and 24 deaths were reported. Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government is rolling back curbs because it can’t support millions of families that depend on daily wages.

The government warned that controls will be reimposed if the public fails to follow social-distancing guidelines.

Others imposed new restrictions: Kuwait, in the Middle East, announced a lockdown from Sunday through May 30.

In Spain, health authorities will allow regions that have demonstrated their hospitals are prepared to handle a second wave of infections to scale back their lockdowns.

In some areas, mostly heavily rural ones, bars and restaurants will be allowed to open up 50% of their outdoor seating on Monday, and churches, theaters and museums can also reopen with limits on attendance.

But Madrid and Barcelona, the country’s largest cities, both badly hit by the virus, will remain locked down.

“The pandemic is evolving favorably, but there is a risk of another outbreak that could generate a serious catastrophe,” Spanish health official Fernando Simón said. “Personal responsibility is vital.”

The outbreak forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to mark Victory Day without the usual pomp of a military parade in Moscow’s Red Square.

This year’s observance had been expected to be especially large because it is the 75th anniversary. Instead, Putin laid flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and a show of military might was limited to a flyover of 75 warplanes and helicopters.

Belarus, though, held a military parade in front of big crowds in the capital, Minsk, despite sharply rising coronavirus infections. Belarus has not imposed restrictions to halt the virus’ spread, and authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has dismissed concerns about it as a “psychosis.”",real

Officials representing the Moscow Department of Health deny that Russia’s official COVID-19 statistics underestimate the number of coronavirus-caused deaths in the country. Such information earlier appeared in a number of publications that analyzed open data on monthly mortality rates.

According to officials of the Moscow Department of Health, 11,846 deaths were registered in the Russian capital in April 2020, which was 1,841 deaths more than was recorded in April 2019. Journalists concluded that 1,800 deaths might not have been accounted for as coronavirus-caused deaths. ""A comparison of mortality rates from the point of view of monthly dynamics is incorrect and does not serve as clear evidence of any trends,"" department officials said.

The ministry emphasized that in Russia and Moscow, unlike in many other countries, autopsies of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are performed in 100% of cases. Therefore, posthumous diagnoses and causes of death are ultimately ""highly accurate."" Thus, according to the department, coronavirus and its complications, most often pneumonia, have claimed the lives of 639 people from the total number of deaths reported in April.

""It is impossible to establish the cause of death as COVID-19 in other cases. For example, over 60% of deaths were caused by obviously alternative reasons, such as vascular diseases (myocardial infarction and stroke), stage 4 malignant diseases (essentially palliative patients), leukemia, ""systemic diseases with the development of organ failure (for example, amyloidosis and terminal renal failure) and other incurable fatal diseases,"" a message posted on the website of the department said.

The department also noted that any seasonal increase in the incidence of ARVI (acute respiratory viral infection) leads to an increase in mortality, let alone the coronavirus pandemic.

""In these cases, the infectious onset acts as a catalyst for the rapid progression of chronic diseases and for the manifestation of new diseases,"" representatives of the department said.

Even if all the additional mortality rate for April in Moscow is attributed to coronavirus, the mortality from COVID-19 will be “slightly more than three percent, which is lower than the official mortality rates in New York and London (10 and 23 percent respectively),” the department concluded.

Earlier, Russia’s Ministry of Health and Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, commenting on an article by The Financial Times, which said that the coronavirus mortality rate in Russia could be 70 percent higher than official statistics, expressed a similar point of view.

The Ministry of Health said that health workers are guided by the rules of the ""International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, 10th Revision.” In cases of the coronavirus infection, “International Guidelines for Certification and Classification (Coding) of COVID-19 as Cause of Death” are used.

The documents are designed to encode COVID-19 as the main cause of death in almost all cases, when a COVID-positive patient dies despite other illnesses that he or she may have had.

“A death due to COVID-19 is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death. A death due toCOVID-19 may not be attributed to another disease (e.g. cancer) and should be counted independently of preexisting conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19,” the document published on the website of the World Health Organization says.

However, the current version of temporary recommendations from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation titled “Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19),” which Russian doctors use as guidelines, say that when formulating a pathoanatomical diagnosis, one should differentiate between deaths caused by COVID-19 as the main disease and deaths against the background of the coronavirus infection, ""but without its clinical and morphological manifestations that could become the cause of death."" Therefore, a significant part of those who died having COVID-19 in Russia may not be included in the stats as those who died from coronavirus.",fake

As data emerges on the spectrum of symptoms caused by COVID-19, it's clear that people with chronic health conditions are being hit harder.

While many people experience mild illness, 89% of people with COVID-19 who were sick enough to be hospitalized had at least one chronic condition. About half had high blood pressure and obesity, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And about a third had diabetes and a third had cardiovascular disease. So, what explains this?

""Obesity is a marker for a number of other problems,"" explains Dr. Aaron Carroll, a public health researcher at the Indiana University School of Medicine. It's increasingly common for those who develop obesity to develop diabetes and other conditions, as well. So, one reason COVID-19 is taking its toll on people who have obesity is that their overall health is often compromised.

But does obesity specifically affect the immune system? Perhaps.

Prior research has shown that people with obesity are less protected by the flu vaccine. They tend to get sicker from the respiratory disease even if they've been immunized. In fact, researchers have found that as people gain excess weight, their metabolism changes and this shift can make the immune system less effective at fighting off viruses.

""What we see with obesity is that these [immune] cells don't function as well,' says Melinda Beck, a health researcher at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Basically, she explains, obesity throws off the fuel sources that immune cells need to function. ""The [immune cells] are not using the right kinds of fuels,"" Beck says. And, as a result, the condition of obesity seems to ""impair that critical immune response [needed] to deal with either the virus infection or [the ability] to make a robust response to a vaccine.""

So this is one explanation as to why people with obesity seem more vulnerable to serious infection. But, there are many more questions about why some people are hit harder, including whether race is a factor.

The CDC found that 33% of people who've been hospitalized with COVID-19 are African American, yet only 13% of the U.S. population is African American. Some local communities have found a similar pattern in their data. Among the many (26) states reporting racial data on COVID-19, blacks account for 34% of COVID deaths, according to research from Johns Hopkins University.

This disproportionate toll can be partially explained by the fact that there's a higher prevalence of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes among African Americans compared with whites.

And as Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said last week at a White House coronavirus task force briefing, this crisis ""is shining a bright light on how unacceptable that is, because yet again, when you have a situation like the coronavirus, [African Americans] are suffering disproportionately.""

There are several factors, including some genetic ones, that may make African Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19. ""There have been a few studies that have pointed to African Americans potentially having genetic risk factors that make them more salt-sensitive,"" says Renã Robinson, a professor of chemistry who researches chronic disease at Vanderbilt University. This may increase the likelihood of high blood pressure, which, in turn, is linked to more serious forms of COVID-19. ""It could be a contributing factor,"" she says, but there are likely multiple causes at play.

Another issue to consider, she says, may be high stress levels. She says when a person experiences racial discrimination, it can contribute to chronic stress. She points to several studies that link discrimination and stress to higher levels of inflammation among black adults. ""And chronic stress can make one more vulnerable to infection because it can lower your body's ability to fight off an infection,"" she says.

Chronic stress is linked to poverty — so this could be a risk factor for low-income communities. In fact, research has shown that people who report higher levels of stress are more likely to catch a cold, when exposed to a virus, compared with people who are not stressed.

According to a new survey from Pew Research Center, health concerns about COVID-19 are much higher among Hispanics and blacks in the U.S. While 18% of white adults say they're ""very concerned"" that they will get COVID-19 and require hospitalization, 43% of Hispanic respondents and 31% of black adults say they're ""very concerned"" about that happening.

And other aspects of structural racism could contribute to the elevated risk for black Americans.

""Every major crisis or catastrophe hits the most vulnerable communities the hardest,"" say Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. And he points to several factors that help to explain the racial divide.

""Black workers are more likely to hold the kinds of jobs that cannot be done from home,"" Morial says. So, they may be more likely to be exposed to the virus, if they are working in places where it's difficult to maintain social distancing. In addition, he points to longstanding inequities in access to quality care.

""There also is bias among health care workers, institutions and systems that results in black patients ... receiving fewer medical procedures and poorer-quality medical care than white individuals,"" he says. He says an expansion of Medicaid into those states that still haven't expanded would be one effective policy to address these inequities.

The characteristics of the communities where people live could affect risk, too especially for those who live in low-income neighborhoods. The roots of chronic illness stem from the way people live and the choices that may or may not be available to them. People who develop the chronic illnesses that put them at higher risk of COVID-19 often lack access to affordable and healthy foods or live in neighborhoods where it's not safe to play or exercise outside.

""Let's take a patient with diabetes for example. They are already at high risk for COVID-19 by having a chronic condition,"" says Joseph Valenti, a physician in Denton, Texas, who promotes awareness of the social determinants of health through his work with the Physicians Foundation.

""If they also live in a food desert, they have to put themselves in greater risk if they want access to healthy food. They may need to take a bus, with people that have COVID-19 but aren't showing symptoms, to get access to nutritious food or even their insulin prescription,"" he says.

Poor nutrition, and the obesity linked to it, is a leading cause of premature death around the globe. And, this pandemic brings into focus the vulnerability of the millions of people living with lifestyle-related, chronic disease.

""We're seeing the convergence of chronic disease with an infection,"" says UNC's Beck. And the data suggest that the combination of these two can lead to more serious illness. ""We're seeing that obesity can have a great influence on infection,"" she says.

So, will this shine a spotlight on the need to address these issues? ""Hopefully,"" Beck says. ""I think paying attention to these chronic diseases like obesity is in everybody's best interest.""",real

In a flash, the daily life of the confident, privileged young woman who’d thrived at school, haunted Broadway stage doors, mastered the New York subway, and, yes, discreetly flashed a fake ID in the bars of Morningside Heights was upended indefinitely. She and the rest of us—my wife, Dee Dee; Kate’s 16-year-old brother, Stephen; and I—have been adjusting ever since. I sat down the other day with the thoughtful, articulate 20-year-old daughter I first held when she was barely more than 20 inches long to ask what she—and, by extension, her college generation—is making of this moment.

“One of the hardest things has been going—and for better or worse—going from being independent to suddenly living in my childhood bedroom again,” Kate told me. “I would go to the dining hall or I would cook for myself, but I would be on my own to secure three meals a day. And I would do my own laundry—and wouldn’t have to do other people’s laundry!” (We’ve all taken strict lessons in sorting darks and lights—and folding—from Dee Dee, whose standards are the crisp ones of the Navy pilot’s daughter she is.) The monotony of quarantine is real, and wearying. “Partly it’s not being able to see anybody who’s not in my immediate family. You know, we all have lunch together, the four of us, almost every day, and that’s totally different from anything that would have happened at school, and it’s never even happened since I was maybe 5 years old and on summer break.”

When Kate first left for college two years ago, I’d pause in mourning every time I passed the open door of that empty bedroom. Now the door is closed, and I have to remember to tread lightly and walk on by. It’s weird for both of us. “I love you guys,” Kate said, “but sometimes I’ll be writing a paper and one of you barges in to ask for help with so-and-so, and I don’t have a space like the library to go and sit and work, just have a little more privacy. I have my own bedroom, which is really great and lucky, but if I come out of my bedroom, then suddenly it’s like I’m fair game to be engaged in conversation.”

Read: Gavin Newsom’s nation-state

One of Kate’s first acts upon returning home was to post a brightly lettered sign on the bedroom door, listing her daily class schedule, with the injunction: “Please knock/text.” Since she’s not only taking online classes, but is 3,000 miles and three time zones away from her teachers, a schedule that she’d deliberately designed to require no commitments before 11 a.m. is now radically different on the West Coast. She’s double-majoring in theater and history, and just stage-managed a student play on Facebook Live. But she’s far away from all her friends.

“Do you miss your friends?” I asked.

“What do you mean ‘Do I miss my friends?’!” she rejoined. “I think everyone misses human interaction that’s not with the people you’ve been stuck with for going on two months … I just miss having people who are going through what I’m going through. We’re all going through the same thing, but one of the hardest things for the transition has been that I’m the one who’s coming back. Everyone else in my house—you three lived here. What don’t I miss about my friends?”",real
1154,176,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/coronavirus-cardiac-heart-attacks.html,2020-03-27,"A Heart Attack? No, It Was the Coronavirus","
The 64-year-old patient arrived at a hospital in Brooklyn with symptoms looking like those seen in patients having a serious heart attack.
An electrocardiogram revealed an ominous heart rhythm. The patient had high blood levels of a protein called troponin, a sign of damaged heart muscle. Doctors rushed to open the patient’s blocked arteries — but found that no arteries were blocked.
The patient was not having a heart attack. The culprit was the coronavirus.The Brooklyn patient recovered after 12 days in the hospital and is now at home. But there have been reports of similar patients in the United States and abroad, and the cases have raised troubling questions for doctors.
What should doctors do these days when they see patients with apparent heart attacks? Should they first rule out coronavirus infection — or is that a waste of valuable time for the majority of patients who are actually having heart attacks?
Should every coronavirus patient be tested for high blood levels of troponin to see if the virus has attacked the heart?
“I don’t know what the right answer is,” said Dr. Nir Uriel, a cardiologist at Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.
The Brooklyn patient had myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that has been seen in patients with other viral infections, such as MERS — also caused by a coronavirus — and the H1N1 swine flu.
But the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, mostly infects the lungs, causing pneumonia in severe cases. Believing it caused respiratory disease, many cardiologists thought the coronavirus was outside their specialty.
“We were thinking lungs, lungs, lungs — with us in a supportive role,” said Dr. John Rumsfeld, chief science and quality officer at the American College of Cardiology. “Then all of a sudden we began to hear about potential direct impact on the heart.”
A report on heart problems among coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, was published in JAMA Cardiology on Friday.
The study, led by Dr. Zhibing Lu at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, found that 20 percent of patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, had some evidence of heart damage.
Many were not known to have underlying heart disease. But they often had abnormal electrocardiograms, like the patient in Brooklyn, in addition to elevated troponin levels, which sometimes soared to levels seen in patients with heart attacks.
The risk of death was more than four times higher among these patients, compared with patients without heart complications.
The journal also published a report, by doctors in Italy, describing a previously healthy 53-year-old woman who developed myocarditis.
Like the patient in Brooklyn, her electrocardiogram was abnormal, and she had high levels of troponin in her blood. Because of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, doctors thought to test her and found she was infected.
Dr. Enrico Ammirati, an expert in myocarditis at Niguarda Hospital in Milan who consulted on the case, said the patient’s heart problems were likely caused by her body’s immune response to the virus.
But so much about this new pathogen is unknown, and it is not yet clear what might cause heart damage following infection.
“Myocarditis can likely be caused either by the virus itself, or the body’s immune and inflammatory response to the virus,” said Dr. Scott Solomon, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School.
Infected patients who get myocarditis do not necessarily have any more virus in their bodies than those who do not develop the condition, he said.
It is possible — but not yet established — that myocarditis results from an immune system that lurches out of control while trying to turn back the coronavirus, pumping out such excessive levels of chemicals called cytokines that cause inflammation that they damage the lungs and the heart alike.
The condition, called a cytokine storm, is more serious in older people and in people with underlying chronic diseases, Dr. Solomon said. It is the primary reason for the severe respiratory complications that can lead to death in patients with the coronavirus.
Cytokines also promote blood coagulation and interfere with the body’s clot-busting system, said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School. Blood clots in coronary arteries can block blood flow and cause heart attacks.
Another possibility, Dr. Libby said, is that some coronavirus patients develop heart problems as a consequence of infections in their lungs.
“The lungs are not working, so there is not enough oxygen,” he said. “That increases the risk for arrhythmias.”
At the same time, fever caused by the virus increases the body’s metabolism and the heart’s output of blood. The result is that the patient’s heart must struggle with an increased demand for oxygen but a reduced supply, an imbalance that may lead to heart damage.
But doctors cannot rule out the possibility that the coronavirus directly damages the heart, several experts said.
In Seattle, a patient infected with the virus recently died after experiencing so-called heart block: The electrical signals originating in the top of the organ, which sets the heart’s normal rhythm, were not reaching the bottom of the heart.
When that happens, the heart goes into an emergency mode with so-called escape rhythm, which causes it to beat very slowly. The man had underlying lung disease, which worsened his prognosis.
Dr. April S. Stempien-Otero, a cardiologist at the University of Washington, hopes an autopsy will show whether the virus attacked the man’s heart.
“We thought it was older-person heart block,” she said. “Then all of a sudden Covid raises its head.”
From now on, she said, “we have to think, maybe that is what is going on.”",real

First Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Alice Wells, who is resigning in May, has accused China of using border clashes with India to change the status quo at the border.

On 20 May, Alice Wells, a US ambassador, spoke at an online conference at the Atlantic Council, one of America's leading think tanks, regarding the border standoff between India and China.

Talking to Rish Verma, the US Ambassador to India from 2014-2017, she drew parallels between the confrontation in the Himalayas and the situation regarding the disputed South China Sea.

The diplomat called China's actions on the border with India, as well as in the South China Sea, ""constant aggression"", ""constant attempts"" to change existing norms and the status quo, Business Insider India cited her as saying.

She then called to counter China, both in the South China Sea and on India's land and sea borders, while adding that the increased presence of the Chinese military on the border, where temporary clashes are quite common, has caused concern on the Indian side. According to her, the issue is becoming more acute in light of Beijing's efforts to ""evade responsibility and spread misinformation"".

Many analysts believe that the United States has always been interested in maintaining tensions between India and China. This is one of the tools to implement their Indo-Pacific strategy, aimed, among other things, at strengthening the country's influence in South Asia, Andrei Volodin, an IMEMO RAS expert, professor at the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry, pointed out:

""The statement (by the American ambassador) is just one example. Moreover, this statement obviously fits into the Trump administration's current general strategy to discredit China as the 'source' of the coronavirus pandemic. The US, which is conducting an anti-Chinese campaign, is now trying to involve the maximum number of not only their satellites in Western Europe, but also the maximum number of Asian states. Asian countries, in general, react quite neutrally to these attempts"".

At the same time, the expert ruled out the possibility that US support for India in the border conflict with China could provoke it to take unilateral action. In the context of the epidemiological crisis, even the Indian military believes that it's necessary to focus as much as possible on the economy and development.

They are ready to come to terms with the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is redistributing forces and assets in favour of the civilian sector.

""In addition, the experience of the 1962 war and subsequent conflicts between China and India is not in India's favour"", Andrei Volodin said.

China's restraint and its ability to achieve mutual understanding with India frustrate Washington's strategic goal of them coming into conflict, as Delhi appreciates its independence and is unlikely to want Washington to use it as a tool to contain Beijing, Wang Peng from the People's University of China said, commenting on the US diplomat's statements:

""The Indo-Pacific Strategy is the key strategy among the Trump administration's global foreign policy aims. In June 2017, there was a standoff between China and India in Doklam, and in November of the same year, the United States introduced the concept of the Indo-Pacific Strategy at the APEC meeting in Vietnam. There were only a few months between those events. It is no coincidence that many analysts believe that the Sino-Indian confrontation could have affected the development of Trump's strategy. The US has never stopped trying to form a political 'square' consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia to deter China"".

© AP Photo / Manish Swarup U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embrace after giving a joint statement in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2020.

""Meanwhile, China maintains restraint and seeks mutual understanding with the Indian side; therefore the United States cannot achieve its strategic goals. The Trump administration relies heavily on provoking disputes and increased tension between certain countries and China to achieve its own goals, which allows the United States to make these countries even more strategically dependent. However, the problem is that the US strategy is contrary to India's national interests and cultural traditions. India really appreciates its independence and doesn't want to be used as a tool"".

The provocative nature of Alice Well's statement is obvious given the difficult situation in the northwest section of the Line of Actual Control between China and India. In fact, her words can even be regarded as US support for India's territorial claims against China, which could make the situation on the Sino-Indian border even more explosive. This month there have already been two, albeit minor, clashes involving dozens of military personnel from both sides.

Additional defensive structures are also being constructed on both sides of the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, which also increases the tension. The other day, the Chinese military reported that India had built fortifications to deliberately foment conflict and unilaterally modify the existing border control system. The Global Times reported, citing a source in the PLA, that it had successfully restored the status quo in the Galwan Valley.

For its part, the Indian Express reported on 20 May that tensions along the Sino-Indian border in Ladakh near lake Pangong Tso had increased. According to the Indian newspaper, the Chinese military had tripled the number of patrol boats in the area to match the number of Indian craft in the waters off the western shore of the lake.",fake
1172,1884,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/coronavirus_basics_too_many_people_never_learned.html,2020-05-23,Coronavirus Basics Too Many People Never Learned,"As a nation and a society, we found ourselves not fully prepared for the sudden global pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. One of many ways that our society is struggling to keep up is for the public to understand basic concepts about medication and how to battle this new virus.

We heard about the couple in Arizona who drank a fish tank cleaner designed to kill parasites in fish aquariums. This was somehow blamed on President Donald Trump — even though the wife is alleged to be a Democrat donor, not a Trump fan.

There are some basic concepts that professionals take for granted that everyone knows. Apparently, some things should be better explained. Your author reviewed these issues with doctors, including a preeminent physician among the top ten finalists for the Nobel in medicine.

First, no one should take medication without being screened by his physician and advised to take it. Too much criticism about COVID-19 is based on the assumption that everyone might run out and start popping hydroxychloroquine pills like candy.

President Donald Trump recently announced that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine together with zinc supplements for almost two weeks now. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, always classy, then called Trump ""morbidly obese"" as a risk factor and gave her medical advice that the medication would be dangerous for Trump.

But medications that are not over the counter require a doctor's prescription. A physician evaluates a patient and screens for risk factors, allergies to medications, and other ""contraindications."" In Trump's case, the White House physician, Sean Connolly — not Pelosi — would decide if Trump's weight argues against the medication or whether hydroxychloroquine makes sense in decreasing the president's chance of coronavirus infection.

For every drug or therapy, the medical community identifies ""indications"" — signs that it may benefit a patient. But there are also ""contraindications."" Those are times when a pill or shot should be avoided because of likely adverse side-effects in spite of possible benefits. In pharmacology, this is the ""benefit/risk ratio."" These are individualized decisions. It is not a ""do it yourself"" project.

Second, we should not be looking for only one solution. Doctors need to select the best medication for each individual, often trying one and then trying another. The antiviral remdesivir looks the most promising at the moment. We would celebrate that great news if remdesivir is unequivocally proven. But we should hope to have several treatments that allow physicians to select the best answer for each individual patient, at different stages of the disease, different symptoms, and different severity. We should not be looking to shut down any lines of research.

Remdesivir is an antiviral that targets specifically an enzyme in the viral genome (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp). Directly targeting the virus would seem to be the most rational approach, rather than treating the subsequent inflammatory responses caused by the virus. Also, remdesivir has fewer risks than hydroxychloroquine for severe side-effects.

Hydroxylchloroquine is an anti-rheumatoid drug, often used when combined with the antibacterial azithromycin (AZT, or Z-pack). It can fight inflammation and/or help transport zinc into cells, which reduces viral reproduction.

Other medications being worked on are targeting completely different phases of COVID-19, such as trying to treat the ""cytokine storm,"" which happens in many of the most severe infections. COVID-19 often produces only moderate flu-like symptoms, but sometimes it generates a catastrophic collapse, sometimes unexpectedly. It is believed that a cascading overreaction of the immune system can causes mass death of cells, including in the sensitive tissues of the lungs, leading to death by oxygen starvation. Researchers are hoping to directly target the genesis of a cytokine storm, which should blunt the worst symptoms of the disease.

Third, treatment is not ""set it and forget it."" Even with the best decisions, a patient may not respond as expected; monitoring and making changes are what the treating physicians do. Medications can affect different people differently. Some people actually experience an opposite effect compared to other people. Some have allergies. Genetic differences can change how people respond to any medication.

Fourth, we are seeing a steady march forward of clinical trials. These are being rushed because of the worldwide crisis against what would normally be a 12- to 24-month timeline. These accelerated efforts involve smaller study groups seeking quicker partial answers than would normally be used. Our modern culture is impatient for quick answers. As is to be expected in quick, small trials, results can be controversial.

But one purpose of such clinical trials is to discover when in the life cycle of a disease a treatment might help, and under what circumstances. So does a drug prevent a disease from becoming severe? Or can it beat back a disease that has already flared up with the worst symptoms?

There is a serious concern when — sometimes — the worst symptoms of COVID-19 dramatically overwhelm a patient, leading quickly to death. One drug may be able to prevent the disease from getting bad in the first place. A different drug might (or might not) be able to pull a victim back from COVID-19's final death spiral. It is the wrong question to ask if a drug is a ""one-size-fits-all"" therapy under all circumstances.

In clinical trials we hear criticism of bad results with some patients. But that's what doctors do — in cooperation with medical researchers. Clinical trials help improve our understanding of who should take which drug and who should avoid which drug.

Doctors informed by this growing body of research decide who should get a prescription and who shouldn't. There are reasons why a doctor's prescription is required. This is not just ""make work"" to make doctors practice their handwriting. Some people are not the right candidates for a particular drug.

Fifth, medications are actually complicated. Virtually all drugs exhibit no effect in some people, are beneficial in most patients, and can be toxic to an unfortunate subset of people. Therefore, early quick and sloppy trials might not be able to delineate all the nuances of any test drug.

We hear that patients are pulled from some study due to adverse reactions. This information can help physicians in prescribing a balance of several medications, taken together and at the right dosage.

Sixth, there has been confusion about the word ""cure."" Our information so far is that COVID-19 runs its course, on its own, in apparently 2 to 8 weeks. We don't talk about a ""cure"" for the flu. We just manage it until the body's immune system defeats the infection.

The real challenge is whether symptoms become so severe that the body cannot overcome the virus — so that the patient dies before the immune system can win the battle. Therefore, treating symptoms matters. If the body can be protected and strengthened from the worst effects of the disease, the body will gain the time and resilience to kill the infection on its own. Some treatments might not be a ""cure,"" but still very important.",fake

On September 20, 1950, a US navy ship released a bioweapon into the air just off the coast of San Francisco in a deliberate attempt to experiment with its own population. The experiment resulted in at least one death and countless other infections. No one was prosecuted. In fact, the mainstream media almost completely ignores this piece of history.

Despite popular claims, Project MKUltra is not a conspiracy theory. According to documents uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act, the government illegally experimented on humans to discover means of mind control. Techniques that were used included high doses of psychoactive drugs, electroshocks, sensory deprivation, electroshocks, isolation, sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. These experiments were not just done on prisoners, it was done to innocent American citizens without their consent, including doctors, military personnel, and members of the general public. This information can all be found in wikipedia.

In one well known incident, government researchers, without informing the men they had the diseases, studied the effects of syphilis on African Americans. Afterwards, they deliberately withheld treatment to the men.

In addiction, there are countless other examples of incidents similar to those mentioned above.

After the sars outbreak in 2002, the United States government funded a collaboration of Chinese scientists and the US military from a bioweapons lab in Dort Detrick. Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. After the program was discontinued, it served as the host for most elements of the United States biological defense program. It was also the grounds for Project MKUltra.

In 2002, Chinese scientists and a team of American scientists led by none-other than Dr. Fauci, teamed up to study the viruses effect on bat tissues. In addiction, they created what is called pandemic superbots. These were strains that were intentionally created to be more lethal than the strains occurring naturally. The fear of these strains being released alarmed other researchers. One Harvard professor told the Time magazine that Dr. Fauci’s work was intentionally weaponizing the virus. Despite this, Dr. Fauci’s work continued to be subsidized by the US government. Yes, I said the US government, not just the Chinese government.

Over the years, there were various incidents that resulted in the new weaponized virus from nearly being released. In response, in 2014, the US government terminated Fauci’s federal funding. This decision, however, did nothing to stop Fauci’s research. Instead, it just shifted the blame away from the US government over to the Chinese government. The research was then shifted to a military lab in a particular place in China. That place was Wuhan. Once the research was moved to Wuhan, the United States government reinstated its funds to the dangerous research. The amount given is thought to be around $3.7 million, although it is likely that it could be much higher.

Bat rectal swap research was also apart of Dr. Fauci’s research. Remember that the virus was alleged to have came from bats.

Three years later, in 2017, Dr. Fauci did an interview in which he claimed President Trump would face a global pandemic. “The history of the last 32 years that I have been the director of the NIAID will tell the next administration that there is no doubt they will be faced with the challenges their predecessors were faced with… We will definitely get surprised in the next few years.”

Indeed, we were surprised. Three years later, a virus similar to the SARS outbreak came about in the same place Dr. Fauci was creating another coronavirus strain at the same time he claimed a global pandemic would break out. Almost immediately after, the man in charge of these research is appointed to advise President Trump. Is this a coincidence? That’s up for you to decide.

If it is true that this virus was intentionally created and released by the United States, it is also worth noting why. There are many reasons to why the United States and China would intentionally release a bioweapon on its own populations. One theory is that the bankers and investors that control the United States government are using this crisis to dethrone the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, replacing it with an IMF based world currency. This currency would be used to even further their control over our monetary system and increase their wealth even more. We have already seen the United States unofficially endorse a IMF backed world currency. That however, can be discussed another time.

Regardless, these revelations should result in some serious questions being asked, including why the media has completely ignored this information and continues to hail Dr. Fauci as a hero.

At least 40,000 people could die with coronavirus in South Africa by the end of the year, scientists have warned.

The projections were made by a group of academics and health experts advising the government.

They assume tough lockdown restrictions will be eased from June, as President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced.

The curbs - which were introduced in March and include a ban on tobacco and alcohol sales - have been credited with slowing the spread of the virus.

The country of 57 million people has recorded just 17,200 cases of Covid-19 and 312 deaths linked to the disease so far. Spain, by comparison, has reported about 278,000 cases and almost 28,000 deaths for a population of only 47 million.

But the projections by the South African Covid-19 Modelling Consortium - set up to help government planning over the outbreak - says the country could experience a sharp rise in cases and deaths over the coming months.

The report was released during a meeting with Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize following criticism of the government's perceived lack of transparency.

The predictions are subject to change as more data becomes available, and assume the current restrictions will be relaxed from 1 June.

Under an ""optimistic scenario"", by late August the number of active cases could reach almost 100,000, before declining. The cumulative number of deaths by November would be 40,000.

Under a ""pessimistic scenario"" the number of active cases could peak around at 120,000 in August, and a total of 45,000 would die by November.

The report also suggests there could be 1.2 million Covid-19 cases in total, and intensive care units could be overwhelmed within weeks.

South Africa's balancing act

By Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg

The politics of Covid-19 and scientific rivalry have intensified in South Africa. The opposition Democratic Alliance is taking the government to court, arguing that the stringent lockdown regulations are unwarranted and the ban on alcohol and tobacco sales should be lifted.

The government itself is not speaking with one voice. This month President Cyril Ramaphosa said lockdown regulations would be eased from ""level 4"" to ""level 3"" to allow schools to reopen and more people to return to work from early June.

But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize seems reluctant, and has said that according to the World Health Organization, South Africa is not yet ready for level 3 because infections continue to rise every day.

It's a balancing act for the government, which has to take the issues of food security, job losses and the economy into consideration. Some scientists have called on the government to fast-track lockdown restrictions to level 2, claiming the current ones have little or no effect on the spread of coronavirus.

In March, President Ramaphosa imposed some of the strictest lockdown measures of any country.

Most workers were ordered to stay at home. In addition to the tobacco and alcohol bans, jogging, cycling and dog-walking were also prohibited.

On 1 May, the curbs were eased from ""level 5"" to ""level 4"", allowing people to exercise between 06:00 and 09:00.

People are still urged to wear face masks in public and observe social distancing rules.",real

Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET on Friday

Think your grocery store runs are tough these days?

In the remote Alaskan city of Gustavus, a small-business owner, Toshua Parker, has started traveling 14 hours by boat to Juneau and back to stock up on critical supplies for his store during the coronavirus pandemic.

The roughly 450 residents in Gustavus rely on Parker's Icy Strait Wholesale for the bulk of their provisions, from fresh produce to hardware to home appliances.

Among locals, Icy Strait Wholesale is better known as ""ToshCo,"" a play on the name of the store's owner and Costco, where the Gustavus business originally sourced most of its items.

In normal times, Parker would rely on Alaska's ferry system to deliver goods. Gustavus, a peninsular region surrounded by Glacier Bay National Park, is only accessible by airplane or boat. But ferry services have stalled — partly because of stoppages related to the coronavirus.

So, the owner found a workaround.

Parker and a crew of staff have been hauling supplies via ship from Juneau, 50 miles away, scheduling each trip around the tides. When Parker finds empty shelves at the local Costco, he gets orders shipped from out of state.

""It's like Christmas when the load gets here,"" Parker told The Hustle. ""Everyone is waiting for it. Word gets out, and they all seem to know when it's coming.""

He credits his 15 employees with helping to keep the store running.

""They're coming to work every day, no matter what, during this pandemic to make sure the town has groceries,"" he said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition.

The store has been keeping anxious locals updated on its Facebook page, uploading photos to share the status of the Gustavus-bound ship or a new restock.

""No reason for panic buying,"" reads one post accompanying a photo of a bulk supply of toilet paper. ""Our supply chain may be occasionally delayed but it's holding. We've got you covered Gustavus!""

In the comments, grateful customers express their thanks.

""We are fortunate to have such dedicated people keeping us fed and supplied,"" wrote one commenter. ""Stoked for flour!!!!"" wrote another.

As the country faces meat shortages triggered by plant shutdowns and outbreaks amid suppliers, the general store is looking ahead. Last week, ToshCo notified its customers that it's stocked aplenty with ammunition for hunting.",real

It is thought to have been the first U.S. sporting event to be held without fans because of the coronavirus crisis.

Less than a week later, there is little to watch in person or from the couch — the sports world having been largely shut down.

A dizzying Thursday hit fans, athletes and all others involved with the games we enjoy, play in and write about seemingly from all sides.

The NHL put its season on indefinite hold, following the lead of the NBA. Major League Baseball canceled all remaining spring-training games, delayed Opening Day by at least two weeks and postponed qualifying games for the 2020 World Baseball Classic.

‘‘Early questions from players: Do we go home now? Stay [in Arizona] and train? How/when do we start back up? . . . Do we still get paid?’’ Cubs infielder Jason Kipnis tweeted.

The XFL canceled the rest of its regular season. NASCAR announced it will proceed as scheduled but without fans in attendance. On the PGA and LPGA tours and on both major tennis tours, events were postponed or canceled.

High school basketball showcases such as the McDonald’s All-American Game and the Jordan Brand Classic were called off, as were many spring games in college football.

And no one was hit harder than college athletes in the winter and spring sports. The NCAA canceled all remaining championships, including the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. This came one day after the NCAA had announced that March Madness would go on without fans at the games.

‘‘These last 24 hours have been heartbreaking,’’ Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman said in a statement.

DePaul’s and Northwestern’s women’s basketball teams will miss out on the Big Dance. The Illinois men’s team won’t get to end a six-season NCAA drought after all. Careers instantly ended for all those teams’ seniors. Dreams instantly disappeared for all those players. Fans — especially the long-suffering ones of the Illini — are left without the chance to write the names of their schools into their brackets.

All that opportunity and reward for so much hard work were lost.

‘‘We took away those moments for a significant number of our student-athletes,’’ Whitman said. ‘‘I know they are devastated. I am, as well.’’

The ACC, Big East, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC postponed all competition at least through the end of March. The Big Ten went the furthest of all the major conferences, canceling all games in all sports through the end of the academic year.

Former Michigan basketball coach John Beilein searched for a positive, describing it as a teachable moment.

‘‘When the basketball stops bouncing, what do you got?’’ he said. ‘‘Well, the basketball stopped bouncing. What type of life are you living? What type of values do you have? This is the good stuff that we could use to teach going forward.’’

On Thursday morning, the IHSA announced its games, including the boys state basketball tournaments, would go on with attendance limits. By evening, though, the high school basketballs had stopped bouncing, too, with all remaining tournament games having been canceled.

And what of Olympic hopefuls eyeing the Summer Games set to open July 24 in Tokyo? The future is in doubt for them, too.

As the NBA worked toward a formal announcement on an initial timetable, Jazz All-Stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert were being treated after testing positive for the coronavirus. Gobert’s positive test came Wednesday, leading the NBA to suspend its season almost immediately.

On Monday, Gobert, unaware of his infection, jokingly touched phones and recording devices belonging to a group of reporters. A video of that ominous scene has since made the rounds.

‘‘I was careless and make no excuse,’’ Gobert wrote Thursday on his Instagram page. ‘‘I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.’’

Tweeted LeBron James: ‘‘What we really need to cancel is 2020.’’

There can be no redo. And in sports, the show won’t go on for a while.",real
1183,1883,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/05/turning_nursing_homes_into_extermination_sites_the_gretchen_factor.html,2020-05-23,Turning nursing homes into extermination sites: the Gretchen factor,"We’re finally getting a clear picture of exactly how the beating of a 75-year-old nursing home patient by a man nearly one-quarter his age came about. And boy, it is a shocker.

It turns out that victim and perp were sent to the Westwood Nursing Center in Detroit due to the fact that both were suffering from COVID. The older man, an Army vet, was snatched from his apartment and dumped in the nursing home without any notification of his relatives, who then spent a considerable amount of time looking for him, to no avail.

As for the younger man, who is evidently named Jaydon Hayden, though the police haven’t yet confirmed it, he was suffering from some sort of breakdown and had been sent to a group home to await treatment when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus and also dumped in the Westview facility. His father, who seems to be a decent sort, says he never should have been put there.

Hayden is now in police custody, while his aged victim is in the hospital.

What it comes down to is that the victim was placed in the nursing home to die while the authorities aimed Hayden at him like a torpedo.

It has not escaped my notice (as it has everybody in the legacy media) that Detroit lies within the realm of her Imperial Majesty, Gretchen the Terrible. Nor has it come as a surprise that Gretchen has adapted the Democratic governor’s go-to policy of using nursing homes as ice floes to dump the sick atop of. But I must admit that I was taken back to learn that Michigan has added “disappearing” patients to the formula. Leave it to Gretchen Whitmer to combine Andrew Cuomo’s already inhumane dump-the-sick policy with the tactics of the KGB.

Clearly, we have yet to plumb the depths of the Cuomo policy. It has always been evident that it was a barely veiled effort to warehouse the sick until they popped off. But this – placing the violent mentally disturbed in the same facilities as the deathly ill with no safeguards or security whatsoever – reveals a callousness that beggars belief. The administrations and bureaucracies of the states following the dump ‘em and run policy – New York, California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania being the chief culprits – have reached a plateau of psychopathy seldom witnessed in this country’s politics. As for stupidity, we’ll let that speak for itself. (Interestingly, Michigan was not even supposed to be on this list. We can hazard to guess that, like PA’s Tom Wolf, Gretchen slipped the policy into effect by stealth, under the impression that the media would let her slide.)

Nor have we seen the end of it. Yesterday Gretchen announced that, obeying the Will of the People, she will continue her iron-fisted policies until at least June 19th. Plenty of those sickies in hiding who need to be rousted out, you know. Not to mention those defiant barbers and ministers. Got to keep an eye on the big picture, playmates. Gretchen will qualify for that VP slot yet, you’ll see. The carpenter’s at work, and the chips will fly…",fake

For more free coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter where all stories are free to read.

The District, Maryland and Virginia have been in a near-total shutdown for months to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) are beginning to relax restrictions in their states. However, areas in the D.C. region that have been hit hard can delay reopening plans.

Northern Virginia will not begin to reopen until May 28 at the earliest — two weeks behind the rest of the state. In Maryland, leaders in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have said it’s too soon to reopen.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also says it’s too early to lift measures for the District, which had been set to expire Friday. Instead, she extended the city’s stay-at-home order, mass-gathering ban and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8, and at least until the decline in new cases lasts two weeks.

All three jurisdictions are looking for signs that the coronavirus “curve” — the number of infections over time — is flattening. They’ve set goals for increased testing capacity, a greater number of hospital beds and more protective equipment for front-line workers.

Despite rigid stay-at-home orders, hundreds of new cases are still reported each day. The number of known novel coronavirus cases in the greater Washington region has passed 70,000, and more than 3,000 people have died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. The newly reported cases tend to stem from confined living quarters such as nursing homes and jails or are among essential workers and those who can’t afford to miss work or are unable to telecommute.

More than 885,000 people in the District, Maryland and Virginia have lost their jobs during the past seven weeks, according to federal data.

Here are answers to frequently asked questions.

What are the current restrictions in the DMV?

Maryland and Virginia have relaxed some of the restrictions that have been in place, while the District and its suburbs remain mostly shut down.

In Virginia, some restaurants, barber shops, and hair and nail salons in areas outside Northern Virginia can reopen with limited capacity, and religious organizations are cleared to hold reduced-capacity services.

Much of Maryland has similar precautions in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Populous areas of the state, including Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, remain closed.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this week extended the restrictions in the city to June 8. Starting on Saturday, D.C. residents and visitors are required to wear face coverings when out in public near others, with some exceptions. People who are exercising or walking do not need to wear a mask, as long as they stay six feet away from others.

For a look across the nation, The Washington Post also has a state-by-state review of the stay-at-home orders.

When will the region reopen?

Any reopening will be gradual, with restrictions lifted in phases.

Each jurisdiction has set goals for lower infection rates, increased testing, greater hospital capacity and much more personal protective gear. Until those goals are met, local officials say most restrictions will remain in place.

In addition to rolling back restrictions outside Northern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) also may adjust the stay-at-home order that expires June 10, which restricts gatherings and other social activities.

[When will Virginia reopen?]

In Maryland, Hogan already has eased some restrictions on outdoor activities, opening public beaches and golf courses in the state. The Washington Post’s Erin Cox reports the plan is to reopen businesses and allow certain social activities in phases.

[When will Maryland reopen?]

Bowser extended the city’s stay-at-home order, ban on mass gatherings and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8. Starting Friday, however, educational and academic retail shops, such as bookstores, can seek waivers to reopen for curbside and front-door pickup sales.

The mayor has created an advisory group, led by Susan E. Rice and Michael Chertoff, to decide when and how to lift restrictions.

[When will D.C. reopen?]

Why are people still getting sick in the region?

Doctors and public health officials tell The Post the coronavirus is increasingly infecting people who cannot afford to miss work — such as grocery store employees, delivery drivers and construction workers. Despite the broad shutdown, there’s still communal spread.

Increased testing across the region helps explain why the daily case count continues to rise. “That is expected,” said Laurie Forlano, Virginia’s deputy commissioner of health. “Obviously we’ll detect more cases, and those cases will be counted.”

But health experts say the region is far from testing enough of the population, including those who are symptomatic and those who are not, to truly know who is infected. The District, Maryland and Virginia do not have enough contact tracers in place to sketch a picture of how the coronavirus is spreading.

Where can I get tested for covid-19?

New testing sites are popping up across the region. Most — but not all — sites require a doctor’s note and scheduled appointment. Clinicians are prioritizing front-line workers and adults who are 65 or older.

Local officials have repeatedly stated reopening the region will depend on how fast they can expand testing capacities in the coming weeks. Health experts say the region still needs to test far more of the population to get a clear picture of who has the virus.

Here’s an updating list of testing sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Can I travel for work? Can I travel out of state?

Certain jobs are listed as essential, and those people are still allowed to travel for work. The definition of essential differs slightly in all three jurisdictions. Read more here.

Some Americans are concerned about heading to work as states reopen businesses to restart the economy. Here are common questions and answers regarding an employee’s rights when returning to work.

There are no restrictions on interstate travel in or out of the District, Maryland or Virginia. However, officials recommend those traveling in from out-of-state locations self-quarantine for 14 days.

Can I go to church, the mosque or synagogue?

Religious institutions in the southern and western parts of Virginia on Friday were cleared to resume indoor services for groups larger than 10.

Houses of worship in Maryland will be allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity — unless local governments deem it unsafe. The Post’s Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Michelle Boorstein report many religious leaders in the area are hesitant to open up their doors again.

The District allows residents to travel to places of worship, but most services have been canceled because of the limitations on gatherings in the region.

A coalition of religious leaders, business owners and Maryland state lawmakers are suing the state government over the governor’s stay-at-home orders. In the lawsuit, the group argues Hogan is violating the constitutional rights of individuals to gather to worship or engage in free speech.

Is public transportation open? Are there any restrictions?

Starting Monday, Metro will require riders to wear masks while on a bus or train. The transit agency has reduced service after “significant” drops in ridership due to regional stay-at-home orders and advised passengers to use Metro only if no other option is available.

Metro officials don’t plan for service to return to pre-pandemic levels until spring of next year, The Post’s Justin George reports. The transit agency plans to continue the current reduced-service schedule until the start of the school year.

Metrobus operates from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week, buses arrive on a Sunday schedule, and over the weekend, they arrive every 30 minutes. All customers should enter and exit the bus at the rear door, except those using mobility devices or who require bus kneeling. Fares are waived during this time.

The D.C. Streetcar operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for essential trips only. Passengers are encouraged to allow extra travel time, as D.C. Streetcars will arrive approximately every 20 minutes.

In Prince George’s County, residents are required to cover their faces on the county’s bus system.

Amtrak has reduced its service between Washington and Boston by as much as 35 percent, The Post’s Luz Lazo reported. All passengers on Amtrak trains and in stations are required to wear masks. The rail company will restore some service on June 1, with the return of Acela, the premier passenger trains that run through the Northeast Corridor.

When will schools open? What about colleges and universities?

Schools in Virginia, Maryland and the District are closed for the rest of the academic year, but remote learning is underway.

In the District, instruction will end in late May, instead of June 19. Some charter schools say they will remain open into June. Private schools are following their own schedules, though most are expected to remain closed through the academic year.

The public school system says it will offer summer school, though it is still unclear if that will be done in person, remotely, or a combination of the two.

Maryland officials say masks, temperature checks and shortened weeks could become the norm when students return to in-person instruction, The Post’s Donna St. George reports.

Schools in Montgomery County and Fairfax County have grappled with the complications related to transitioning to full-time online learning.

Most jurisdictions are offering free meals to students and all children, and the federal government is allowing school districts to distribute meals “to a parent or guardian to take home to their children,” The Post’s Hannah Natanson reports. Here is a list of places to pick up breakfast and lunch in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Local colleges and universities have cleared their campuses, too, but are now facing questions about how to fill classrooms in the fall. Hundreds of colleges and universities have pushed back admission decision deadlines to June 1 and offered extensions, especially for out-of-state students.

As schools prepare for next semester, leaders are considering a few different options — including extending virtual classes, bringing students back to campus for in-person classes, or a hybrid model in which students do both. Final decisions may not come for weeks.

Officials at George Washington University said they will make a decision about next semester by June 15, though university President Thomas J. LeBlanc warned he may extend that deadline as it approaches. Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, which includes U-Md. and 14 other public universities and education centers, said he is “reasonably optimistic” campuses will reopen by September.

What’s the situation at local nursing homes?

As of late April, at least 255 nursing homes in the greater Washington region reported coronavirus cases.

Former and current employees at Maryland nursing homes tell The Post their facilities are struggling with shortages of staff, testing and personal protective equipment. Maryland regulators already have announced fines for one nursing home.

Hogan has ordered universal testing for nursing home residents and employees, making Maryland one of the first states to do so.

The federal government issued guidelines in April requiring nursing homes to update patients’ families regularly on coronavirus cases in their facilities.

Maryland health officials publish a list online of every nursing home reporting an outbreak. As of May 6, according to state data, long-term-care facilities in Maryland have accounted for more than 6,000 of the state’s coronavirus infections and more than 800 covid-19-related deaths.

The District occasionally provides a list of nursing homes with outbreaks in the mayor’s daily briefing.

Virginia reports the aggregate total of outbreaks at nursing homes across the state but does not list specific long-term-care facilities.

What businesses are open? When will other stores reopen?

In Virginia, restaurants already licensed for outdoor seating can open at half-capacity with social distancing requirements, while barber shops and hair and nail salons can open for appointments and with strict guidelines. Nonessential retail stores can open with limits on the number of customers allowed in the store. Employees are required to wear face masks, and customers are strongly encouraged to wear them.

While religious organizations can hold services, gatherings must be at 50 percent capacity and are subject to other safety requirements. Movie theaters, concert venues, amusement parks, bowling alleys and indoor gyms remain closed.

In Maryland, many similar precautions are in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Hogan replaced a statewide stay-at-home order with a “safer at home” policy that relaxes some restrictions.

The new policy allows some nonessential retailers to reopen, including clothing and shoe stores, pet groomers, animal adoption shelters, carwashes, art galleries and bookstores. But they must remain at 50 percent capacity or less, employees must wear masks, and other social distancing restrictions must be observed.

The changes took effect at midnight in Virginia and at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland. The changes do not apply to Northern Virginia or the Maryland suburbs.

How can I apply for local unemployment benefits?

A few weeks ago, The Post’s personal finance columnist, Michelle Singletary, shared her guidance about eligibility and how to apply for unemployment benefits.

More than 885,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in the District, Maryland and Virginia since the Washington area closed down under the stay-at-home orders.

What do I need to know about grocery shopping?

Supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants have all adapted to meet the changing demands, now that people in the Washington region are stocking up.

Face masks are required at grocery stores in the District and Maryland, while face coverings are recommended in Virginia but not mandated. Officials recommend shoppers wash their hands before and immediately after shopping for groceries and bring their own disinfectant wipes if planning to use a shopping cart.

Stores are offering older shoppers dedicated hours, usually early in the mornings, so they can shop without crowds. The District has extended sidewalks near some grocery stores to allow for social distancing.

Farmers markers in the region are still open, but vendors often require advance orders for curbside pickup. Farmers report more people are signing up for community-supported agriculture, or CSA, preorders, and some already have waitlists for new members. Restaurants are selling staples, like milk and eggs, alongside prepared takeout fare.

Can I go for a run? What else can I do outside?

The District, Maryland and Virginia’s stay-at-home orders allowed for walking, biking, dog walking, hiking and running outside, as long as people remain six feet away from those outside their household. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people build exercise into their routines during the outbreak to keep physically and mentally healthy.

A person is allowed to walk, bike or run through a park or trail, but all three jurisdictions caution against sitting or congregating in parks or public fields.

Maryland has relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities. Public beaches are open for exercise. Family members from one household can go camping, fishing and hunting, as well. For more on what is and is not allowed outside under all three orders, read here.

If you've lost your job due to the coronavirus and worry about affording mortgage payments, ask your lender whether they're making exceptions for people who have been impacted.

You may choose to refinance for lower monthly payments and a lower interest rate.

If you've built equity in your home, you can tap into your equity through a cash-out refinance or HELOC and use the money to pay bills.

As businesses around the US close to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, millions of Americans are losing work and worrying about how to pay their bills.

If you're concerned about affording mortgage payments, take comfort in knowing you have options. Here are three possible paths you can take moving forward.

1. Ask your lender about assistance for home owners impacted by COVID-19

Federal mortgage loan companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are making exceptions for homeowners who have been financially impacted by the coronavirus.

You can apply for forbearance for up to 12 months without facing penalties, and the companies won't report forbearance to credit unions. Beginning July 1, 2020, people with a Fannie Mae- or Freddie Mac-backed mortgage can choose to repay their deferred amount in one lump sum when they sell, refinance, or pay off their home entirely.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are offering mortgage modification programs to decrease monthly payments, and they are temporarily suspending evictions and foreclosures.

Most private lenders are also providing relief for homeowners who have been impacted by COVID-19. In California, over 200 banks and credit unions have agreed to waive mortgage payments for 90 days without hurting borrowers' credit scores.

""The first step, if you're looking for relief, is just to call your bank up and get someone on the phone,"" says Andy Taylor, general manager of Credit Karma Home. ""It might be a long queue to get through, but bear with it, because it's important. And ask what your options are.""

Taylor says institutions will probably ask for proof of economic hardship before agreeing to alter your mortgage payments. You may be able to show pay stubs or a letter from your employer to verify you qualify for assistance.

2. Look into refinancing with a small company

Maybe your lender isn't offering exceptions during the outbreak, or you just want to explore other options. Depending on what type of loan you have and how much of your mortgage is left outstanding, refinancing may be a good option.

When you refinance your mortgage, you take out a brand new loan with a new interest rate. If your credit score and financial history are strong, you might be able to score a lower rate than you have now.

""Probably the best way is to find your local mom-and-pop credit union,"" says Taylor. ""Someone who isn't going to have a nationwide footprint, who isn't going to be as inundated as someone who's advertising globally online.""

Lenders have been slammed with refinancing applications the past few weeks. But some small companies might be less overwhelmed, giving them the ability to act more quickly and give you personalized attention.

""Or find a local mortgage broker,"" Taylor continues. ""Mortgage brokers can often unlock loan products that you wouldn't be able to find as a typical consumer, because they can shop around for a greater variety of loan products that are out there.""

As an added bonus, you'll be helping local credit unions and mortgage brokers that might be hurting financially during the coronavirus pandemic. ""You can support them, get a better rate, solve your cash flow problem, and pay a little less out of pocket every month,"" says Taylor. ""That's a good thing all around.""

3. Tap into your home equity

Have you gained equity in your home? Maybe your home's value has increased, or you've paid down your mortgage substantially. Look for ways to liquidate that equity to access cash for mortgage payments.

Taylor says homeowners with equity might consider cash-out refinancing.

Cash-out refinancing is a little different from regular refinancing. You still get a brand new loan, but now the loan amount is for more than what you owe.

Subtract the amount you owe from the amount you receive as a loan. You get to pocket what's left. You're allowed to spend that money on other financial needs — like mortgage payments.

""You could both simultaneously cash out the equity in your home — take a little bit of money that you've built up — and also lock in a lower rate,"" says Taylor. ""That solves two problems. One, it can solve a cash flow problem, namely you're paying a lower amount every single month. And two, it means you can use that money for things like paying for the mortgage itself.""

Another option opening a home equity line of credit, Taylor says. A HELOC is a second mortgage that works sort of like a credit card; use this line of credit used to pay for things, then pay back the borrowed money plus interest each month.

While money from your HELOC doesn't go toward mortgage payments, it can help you stay afloat by covering expenses like utility bills or car payments.",real

by Dr. Jospeh Mercola

Mercola.com

In this interview, Brian Hoyer — one of the primary consultants for my latest book, “EMF*D” — discusses how electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation may be impacting the COVID-19 epidemic and your infection risk. Many have raised questions about whether there is a connection between 5G and this pandemic.

In some ways, the connection between COVID-19 and 5G is a moot issue. In other ways, it’s not. Either way, it’s tangential to what you need to do now to protect yourself and your family from here on out. At the time of this interview, which took place March 31, 2020, a vast majority of those who have died from COVID-19 were elderly.

Those who died in China and Italy under the age of 50 have generally been encumbered with obesity, diabetes and hypertension, with insulin resistance being the common denominator. Very few under the age of 19 are affected.

That said, the infection appears to be more aggressive than influenza in older individuals, and the illness lasts longer than the regular flu. So, there’s enhanced virulence to this virus for some reason we yet do not understand. While unproven, one current theory is that EMF radiation — and the addition of 5G in particular — could be having an impact.

Electrification and Global Illness

Hoyer cites data from Dr. Arthur Firstenberg’s book, “The Invisible Rainbow,”1 in which he catalogued epidemiological evidence showing that as electrification of the world was implemented, throughout the course of history, viral pandemics ensued.

“The big one in there that’s been cited on the internet about possible connection to 5G is, if you go back to 1918 when the Spanish flu went around the world, that was when the first radio telegraphs were more widely used.

You see the Spanish flu popping up all over the world, but [not] in a way [that would suggest] we are passing it from person to person, but [it popped up on] one side of the world to the other side of the world very quickly.

Today, we wouldn’t know if that’s happening because we travel so frequently. And there are theories out there about how viruses actually transmit from person to person … That said, what we have is probably the unhealthiest population in the history of mankind … as far as chronic conditions … We also have more sterility …

But we also have more practices of separation and decontamination, and all of those things are better than ever before. So why is this virus spreading so rapidly?

I believe it has to be the terrain of the individual and also environmental stressors that are creating this perfect storm where a virus has an easy way to get into the body and can actually reproduce on the cellular level inside of the human body. Which is really how viruses work. It’s not the same as bacteria. I think a lot of people have that false sense that a virus is just a smaller version of a bacteria.”

Viral Pandemics Coincide With Increases in EMF Exposure

In his book, Firstenberg brings up this concept that there is a connection between EMF and influenza. And, this connection existed far before the advent and introduction of man-made EMFs, which probably happened in very small quantities in the late 18th century.

But, he also describes something called the maunder minimum, which lasted from 1645 to 1715. Essentially, this was a period of time when the sun was very quiet and had very few or no sun spots.

Then, in 1727, the number of sun spots increased to over 100 for the first time in over a century. Now, I know this is ancient history, but it’s important to understand that because in 1728, influenza arrived in waves over the entire planet and it was the first flu pandemic in almost 150 years.

So, this is the first hint, at least historically, that there might be a connection between EMF and viral illness because, in the solar flare, you’re going to have increased radiation. The next major pandemic was in 1889, and the interesting part of this, which Hoyer mentioned, is that this infection was established pretty much everywhere all at once.

We obviously did not have transcontinental flights the way we did in the current COVID-19 disease. It appears to have emerged in Wuhan City, China, where, incidentally, 5G had recently been rolled out, but millions of people traveled in and out of that area and on to other parts of the world.

Well, the 1889 epidemic took place at a time when we didn’t have the ability to travel very fast or far. Yet, the pandemic emerged very rapidly in widely scattered regions around the world. Interestingly, in 1889, we saw the emergence of what Firstenberg calls power line harmonics. According to Firstenberg, that changed the Earth’s magnetic field, ushering in the 1889 influenza pandemic.

Next, there was the Spanish flu of 1918, which also spread far more rapidly than it could or should have were it spread through travel. In 1918, radio was the emerging technology. Firstenberg’s revised edition also mentions 5G technology.

In summary, his book builds a case for the theory that increases in EMFs, natural or man-made, might make us more susceptible or sensitive to viral illnesses. If natural EMF exposures have the ability to influence our biology, it’s not so hard to imagine that man-made exposures might have an exponential impact. Hoyer adds:

“Things are happening now that have never happened before. We [have] a lot of people who are electrosensitive. One of the things they report is that … they feel sick during lightning storms with influenza-type symptoms. Flashes of lightning create a radio frequency. It’s called microwave sickness in the literature.

A lot of people call it electromagnetic hypersensitivity or electrosensitivity, but in a lot of the literature, you have to look up microwave sickness … Then you’ll find these references to when storms come, when solar flares are active, people are getting more and more symptoms.

Depression is a huge thing that happens when there’s more solar radiation and also during a full moon even. So, there’s a lot of natural electromagnetic radiation that happens. Most of that is gradual, but with the radio frequency (RF) lightning pulses, those are definitely a pulsed phenomenon … I think it’s in the kilohertz range. But it varies … it’s never the same frequency, it’s always different.

You’ll actually hear it when the lightning goes off and if you have a really sensitive meter, when you turn on and off light switches, you can hear the arcing and there’s an RF that transmits out from that arcing that happens … Solar flares … can affect all types of electronics and can cause electromagnetic interference, and that is technically in the kilohertz to megahertz range.”

We Don’t Know What We Haven’t Studied

A significant problem with man-made EMFs is that they’re pulsed. We are also surrounded by RF radiation, both analog RF signals from radio stations and pulsed RF signals.

“A lot of times I wonder, ‘What would a real study look like if you have the 50 Hz to 60 Hz modulation and the RF and everything?’ Usually, in these studies, they’re just testing one thing in a controlled environment.

They’re never testing the entire soup that we’re constantly bathed in as human beings. We’re the big experiment here and they’re just testing one thing at a time in this Western medicine type of fashion,” Hoyer notes.

With regard to COVID-19, underlying health conditions clearly appear to play a role. However, we don’t know whether the use of certain drugs might have a bearing on the severity of the disease and its outcome.

For example, while French doctors say they’ve noticed a pattern that patients given ibuprofen fared worse than those given acetaminophen, their findings have been largely ignored simply because there are no studies to prove it.

When did clinical findings become useless? If anything, clinical suspicions should be rapidly considered and acted upon during an active pandemic when time is of the essence. At this time, we really need to listen to the medical professionals in the field who are treating patients.

Link Between 5G Implementation and COVID-19 Hotspots?

During a March 12, 2020, lecture at the Health and Human Rights Summit in Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Thomas Cowan likely stunned the audience by bringing up a potential connection between 5G and COVID-19.

By and large, many of the areas hardest hit by COVID-19 have recently implemented 5G which, at least theoretically, might render residents more prone to serious infection by lowering their immune function.

Cowan also presents the theory that COVID-19 and other influenza epidemics are not transmitted from person to person but, rather, are the result of cellular toxicity, including but not limited to EMF-induced cellular toxicity.

To be clear, I’m not saying 5G spreads the infection or is a vector of infection. But by lowering your natural immune defenses and causing chronic inflammation, it is likely impairing your innate immune system’s ability to fight off the coronavirus. Naturally, this increased susceptibility to illness would apply to all disease, both acute and chronic, and would not be limited to COVID-19.

Exaggerated EMF exposure may well be a hidden variable that could be contributing to the reason why so many people get sick in particular areas. Intense EMF exposure could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back, meaning the factor that breaks the immune system.

“[Cowan] is a top-notch doctor, he’s on the cutting edge,” Hoyer says. “In that video, he talks about Wuhan as one of the testing grounds for 5G, where 5G was first implemented in China. And what’s interesting about Italy … is that Milan — the Lombardi area of Italy where two-thirds of the cases are — is considered the 5G capital of the European Union according to Vodafone, which is the big 5G carrier out there …

If you go on Vodafone’s website, you can see the 5G map, and it’s sprinkled throughout all Milan and Lombardi, that province up there. So that is definitely a more concentrated area. On top of that, you have all of the older population in Italy, and people that are likely fully buying into the Western medicine and are on [multiple] medications — those sorts of things.

The way that all of those medications are interacting, combined with the 5G stress and the electromagnetic stress, I think it’s no wonder everyone’s immune system is suppressed and they’re so susceptible. It’s the terrain that’s the problem, the environmental stress.

We can actually kind of control that ourselves. Getting off of our phones and working to shield our environment will help to strengthen our immune system. Then taking some … supplements can take to help boost your immune system …

So, there’s 5G in Milan, in Wuhan, and New York City is one of the highest, most intense [5G] areas I’ve seen, and Seattle … But 5G doesn’t matter so much to me. It’s about the intensity of the EMF. New York was basically as intense as a 5G area already, before 5G was implemented, in my opinion. It maxes out all of our meters wherever I go. There are hidden antennas everywhere in New York City.

[Seattle] has a lot of hills in the city, and right on Queen Anne, there are two huge radio towers with probably 100 antennas on them, just blasting the whole city. We’ve had assessments there where we’ve maxed out [our meters], and even shielded rooms upstairs and it still maxed out.

So, we have to do a complete covering of the floor, the ceiling and the walls, and be really strict about how we’re doing the shielding over the windows so that everything is sealed almost perfectly, like a true perfect Faraday cage. In most homes we don’t have to do an absolutely perfect Faraday cage, with all the electrical connections and no gaps whatsoever. We can still dial it down to where the levels are low enough.

But in places where it’s really intense, we have to use different strategies in order to make it so that there’s absolutely no gaps … The exponential pressure of all that EMF radiation that can leak in through a tiny hole is really important in those more saturated areas …

Some people watching this will be like, ‘Oh, EMF is the cause of everything.’ That’s not what I’m saying at all. But it definitely weakens our immune systems. Martin Pall’s research shows one mechanism for how that happens and … we know how electric the body is.

I mean, the heart communicates with the brain through an electromagnetic pulse, that’s been proven with the HeartMath studies … You can [find] fascinating articles on there about how we physiologically depend on different voltage changes in order for our body to function optimally.

Just to think that there are people out there that believe this environment we’ve created does not affect us — it’s insane when you start to read some of these studies about how our body uses voltage to heal and to function.”

How to Protect Yourself Now

I’ve published a series of suggestions on how to minimize your risk of COVID-19, including the use of sauna, nebulized hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C, ozone, melatonin and other nutraceuticals.

My favorite supplement of all, which I believe is particularly useful at this time, is molecular hydrogen tablets. The tablets are made of metallic magnesium, which when placed in water dissociates into magnesium ions, not a salt like magnesium oxide or magnesium threonate.

It’s just simple pure magnesium, which doesn’t have a laxative effect, and molecular hydrogen gas — both of which are extraordinarily useful for mitigating the negative effects and impacts of EMF.

I think almost everyone would benefit from them. The beautiful thing about molecular hydrogen is that it’s a selective antioxidant. Unlike most traditional antioxidants that indiscriminately reduce most free radicals, molecular hydrogen merely helps activate endogenous antioxidants to reduce the damage from the NRLP3 inflammasome activation.

The magnesium, meanwhile, acts as a calcium channel blocker, which helps mitigate the damage from the EMF exposure. So, it helps in many different ways. I think it’s one of the best strategies during this epidemic.

I recommend taking two tablets in water once a day (twice if you have heavy exposure either to COVID-19 or EMFs). Ideally, you want to pulse your intake, as consuming it regularly doesn’t seem to work as well. You need to pulse it to get the benefit because there needs to be a change in the concentration in your system.

As for lowering your EMF exposure, you can download a free chapter from my book, “EMF*D” that summarizes most of the major recommendations. I also review the most important considerations in “The No. 1 Thing to Do to Protect Yourself From EMFs.”

Hoyer is also working on videos demonstrating how to use shielded paint and other remediation strategies, so keep an eye out for those on his website, ShieldedHealing.com.

“Many are at home right now. You have time to do this. Our company stocked up on shielding paint before [the COVID-19 pandemic] so we don’t have to import it anymore. It would be a good time to take on a [remediation] project. Beyond that, things you can do right now is get off your cellphone. Your cellphone is a walking cellphone tower. I always have mine on airplane mode …”

Be Mindful of Symptoms of EMF Sensitivity

The most important area to shield is your bedroom, as that is where you spend your nights — the time when your body is going through its most valuable regeneration and healing processes. Sleeping in an EMF-free environment can go a long way toward avoiding electrosensitivity, which by the way tends to come on very rapidly, in many cases seemingly “overnight.”

Common symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity include ringing in the ears, a feeling of burning or prickling in the skin, headache, heart palpitations and inexplicable anxiety, for example. Once you’re electrosensitive, additional and more extensive remediation strategies may become necessary.

Again, it may not be 5G per se that breaks down the immune system, but rather that the total EMF burden simply exceeds the tolerable threshold of many individuals.

“It involves a lot of detox of different heavy metals [and chemicals],” Hoyer explains.”There’s a chemical load, there’s heavy metal load. There’s all types of stressors that we need to reduce to make a person less electrosensitive. We’re getting more and more sensitive as a species and eventually we’ll hit a tipping point — perhaps once you add a virus that we’ve never had exposure to before …

You have to wonder, is this the tipping point? Not necessarily 5G? Is this virus and even 4G the tipping point? I wonder about that. I know 5G is adding more saturation of these frequencies, but we really need to get to a point where we understand that, at least in the bedroom, we need to be shielded. If you’re still reacting to things, you have to do more work.”

On 5G Frequencies

As explained by Hoyer, EMF shielding materials are capable of blocking about 99% of the harmful frequencies we’re exposed to, but not the lower frequencies associated with the Schumann resonance, which are associated with healing. He also points out that:

“A lot of people equate 5G with millimeter waves (MMW). That’s absolutely not the case in my opinion. I’ve tested … frequencies all the way up to 23.5 gigahertz (GHz) with 3G and 4G as back haul transmitters. Satellite TV is 12 to 18 GH.

The 5G frequencies they’re going to be using, or are using in some areas, are point-to-point communication right now … it’s laser pointed. I had a meter that measured MMWs and I took it to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

I didn’t detect anything in Austin where 5G was live. In Los Angeles, there were some neighborhoods where I barely detected something, but I had to point my receiver directly at the antenna to get it. If I was even a centimeter off, I would not detect it.

So [5G antennas] are like laser pointed frequencies from what I can tell with the testing that I did. And most of the 5G frequencies we’re being exposed to are going to be below 6 GHz. That’s what’s going to be communicating with our devices if you choose to get a 5G device, which I would recommend not to do …

We have much more saturation, like in Houston, there’s 3.5 GHz on every telephone pole. That’s a higher frequency than 2.4 so it’s faster. Five GHz on your router is faster. Some people report more symptoms from 5 GHz router versus 2.4 GHz and vice versa. It seems to be frequency dependent.

What’s interesting is the lower the frequency, down to 50 or 60 megahertz (MHz), the more it resonates with the human body. The size of the human body you’re getting in around 60 to 80 MHz range is about 6 foot. That’s what your body will resonate with.

On any meter where I measure this, I measure it with a real-time spectrum analyzer. You can actually see the rise and you’re using your body as an antenna much more from about 60 MHz all the way up to around 900 MHz, sometimes in up to 1500 MHz you can still see this antenna effect on the body.

But the higher frequencies don’t resonate as much with the conductance of the skin. So, your skin does provide a slight Faraday cage against the higher frequencies, but these lower frequencies definitely penetrate, including T-Mobile’s 600 MHz 5G frequency, which goes further and can penetrate deeper into tissue and through forests and everything.”

What Will 42,000 Satellites Do to the Earth?

SpaceX, which currently has about 400 low-Earth orbiting satellites, has obtained permission to put 42,000 satellites into orbit in order to provide the whole world with 5G coverage. The exact ramifications of this saturation remain to be seen, but I’m not particularly optimistic. Hoyer comments:

“SpaceX has about 400 satellites up. That was the number Elon Musk wanted to start … testing the network. That could turn on at any time. So those of us out there who are electrosensitive are paying attention and reading the news on that.

Amazon … Facebook [and] companies in the U.K. and Canada also have petitions to put up satellites, so it’s not just SpaceX … But SpaceX is looking at doing 42,000 satellites. They just got approved by the government for 1 million antennas on the ground, to work with the satellites. That is what I’m much more concerned about than the stuff beaming down from above, because they’re closer …

I think a lot of people are very concerned. I almost see this apocalyptic look on people’s faces when we talk about the Starlink and the satellites … like we’re not going to be protected at all. It’s just going to be everywhere.

Well, I think that’s true, but even the satellite dishes that we have for television and cable, you have to have a dish that collects that signal and concentrates it up. So, they’re actually pretty weak signals coming from above. It’s not like they’re completely blasting you with a laser beam down.

But like I was saying, the 1 million antennas on the ground, that’s what I’m much more concerned about. And then the devices that we and our neighbors have, those are very concerning. If you have a metal roof, that’s going to protect you somewhat from a lot of the different frequencies that are beaming down … I’m much more concerned about the stuff that’s way closer to us.”

Compassion for Each Other Is Paramount

As noted by Hoyer, we need to have more compassion in general for those who are immune compromised. Clearly, they need to be protected from SARS-CoV-2. But they also need to be protected from wireless frequencies and EMF exposure, and few give this a single thought.

“Many of these older people grew up in an environment where they didn’t have nearly as much EMF exposure. There’s still some of these older people who grew up in places that didn’t even have electricity.

So, just thinking about the irony of that whole thing gives me this sense of wanting to have more compassion for our fellow man, and also the tragedy of the social distancing that we have as well. I would love to have a solution to remedy that, but I’m just going to keep trucking on and doing what I do best and help people.”

The Revolutionary Guard has pushed for the under-reporting of coronavirus cases in the country, and a relaxation of the lockdown.

That triggered a resurgence of infections in April, sources tell Insider.

The Revolutionary Guard has also recently bungled a missile test that killed 19 sailors and accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet.

The Rouhani government thus sees an opening to take more control of the situation.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Iran's elected government under President Hassan Rouhani is embroiled in an internal power struggle against hardline factions of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for control of the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis.

The struggle has been exacerbated by two military disasters this year: January's accidental shootdown of a Ukrainian jetliner over Tehran, which killed 176 people; and last Sunday's failed naval missile test that accidentally killed at least 19 Iranian sailors and left more than a dozen still missing.

Iran was the second nation after China to suffer a major outbreak of COVID-19. The disease ripped through top officials and health care workers in the holy city of Qom before spreading to the rest of the nation. But despite social media posts publicising the widespread deaths and a collapsed healthcare system dating back to February, official reports have put Iran's total infection counts at just 114,533 cases as of May 14, with 6,854 dead.

Insider's sources say those numbers greatly downplay the extent of Iran's COVID problem.

'Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom'

""[The Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard have been downplaying the extent of the COVID problem since the initial outbreak hit their guys hard in Qom at the start of the outbreak,"" said a regional intelligence official in the Middle East who does not have permission to speak about a top military rival.

""Rouhani's government has tried to take control of the situation and use the extensive health ministry networks that it controls to reduce the outbreak. But our intelligence indicated that reports about a struggle between the elected officials and the unelected structures controlled by Khamenei.""

Before the crisis, Iran was already under economic pressure from harsh sanctions enforced by the United States intended to deter its development of nuclear weapons. The partial nationwide shutdown combined to prevent the spread of coronavirus exacerbated the situation. Our source says that national security officials linked to Khamenei reportedly forced the government to ease restrictions — and that generated an uptick in infections across the country in April. The news was suppressed in international reporting.

'The numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect'

""Any of the numbers the Iranians have put out since late April are considered extremely suspect because we have indications that the Revolutionary Guard — which means this comes from Khamenei's office directly — are not reporting cases from its health and military infrastructure and possibly intimidating reporting from other areas as well because the leadership has decided this is a national security issue, where too many cases will make Iran look inept and weak in the face of American pressure,"" one source told Insider.

The Iranian economy, which had been battered by sanctions, is expected to collapse further during the COVID epidemic. The last two years has seen Iran's currency lose more than 60% of its value and a rise 37% in consumer prices this year alone. At the same time, historically low oil prices in 2020 have reduced Iranian revenue.

An oil industry analyst based in the UAE — who asked not to be identified discussing matters that affect clients' oil revenues — said that Iran's elected government is hurt worse by the collapse of the oil prices than the Revolutionary Guard. The Revolutionary Guard maintains its own parallel government and economy in Iran. The government, by contrast, relies on traditional taxation and revenue budgeting processes, which are dependent on the health of the oil market. The Revolutionary Guard, said the source, has far more flexibility to raise and spend money through non-traditional means.

""The Guard has always maintained its own cash flow from oil skimmed off the national production, through sweetheart contracts, and company ownership deals, and through off-the-books trade both in and out of Iran. And that's before the direct support it gets from religious institutions and charities directly controlled by the supreme leader,"" said the source. ""Rouhani is forced to try to wrest political control over the Iranian system from a system designed to operate outside of that system. It's not easy.""

A 2013 investigation by Reuters estimated that Khamenei controlled assets in the tens of billions of dollars from a complex web of religious institutions, corporate investment and asset seizures. The result is that the Revolutionary Guard is a quasi-independent military and economic center of power of its own.

""He's got the type of money on hand to compete with a nation-state - the only other person with personal access to this much cash is probably Putin,"" said a financial intelligence analyst with a NATO member's intelligence service. ""Khamenei funds an independent parallel state that directly competes with Rouhani.""

The Guard's ineptitude has provided an opening for the government

The elected government — which controls ministries and the official armed forces and intelligence services of the Iranian state — has a financial and security disadvantage, by comparison.

But multiple sources said January's inept shootdown of the Ukrainian jet, plus last week's botched naval missile test that struck a naval vessel instead of the target it was towing, has given Rouhani some leverage to pressure the government response to COVID.

In separate statements, the clubs announced that the matches would take place at each of their stadiums and would raise money for boosting healthcare resources in Italy and Spain, but not in Germany.

“The net proceeds from all three games will be donated to medical facilities in Italy and Spain,” said Bayern’s statement.

“FC Bayern sees its contribution as a symbol of support for a united Europe, in which everyone takes responsibility for each other.”

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: “Despite all the suffering and all the problems, we in Germany are perhaps fortunate that our healthcare system is proving resilient in this crisis.

“But we have also seen horrifying images from Italy and Spain, both countries among those hardest hit in Europe by the pandemic.”

Italy is the second-worst affected country in Europe behind Britain by the coronavirus, with a death toll of more than 32,000. Spain is the third-worst affected, with over 27,000 people dying from the virus.

Germany has fared comparatively well, registering 8,007 deaths despite having the highest population in Western Europe.

Last Saturday, the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league in Europe to resume action after the virus paralysed world sport in March.

Bayern will host Real at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Real will play against Inter at their Santiago Bernabeu stadium, while Inter would host Bayern at the San Siro.

The three clubs added that healthcare professionals who have fought against the pandemic would be invited to the matches, which will take place when it is safe for supporters to return to stadiums without risk of being infected by the virus.",real

But I will honor her memory with my vote on Nov. 3","I woke up on Thursday, March 26, in Chicago. We had been under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order for nearly a week.

Other than to buy groceries, I had left my apartment only for short walks, eager for warm weather as Chicago’s winter finally began to fade. That day, Mayor Lori Lightfoot shut down Chicago’s lakefront because folks couldn’t seem to follow the rules. It felt like the teacher cancelling recess because of those two kids who just won’t listen.

Opinion

My days during the first week of stay-at-home had all been much of the same — work from home, exercise when I remembered, take in too much news (and wine) and slowly get through the unread books on my bookshelf. I had started writing “read during the COVID-19 pandemic” in the back of the books that I finished, thinking about the conversations I might have one day with my future children and grandchildren.

Video conversations with my family and friends were bright spots during a gloomy time.

But that Thursday was different. I woke up to a text from my sister saying there was a COVID-19 case at our grandma’s long-term care facility in Flossmoor. My siblings and I, spread across the country from Denver to New York, video-chatted, and then we talked with our mom. We were worried, unsure of what to do or how to react.

I thought about going up to Evanston to see my mother, but my fear of possibly exposing her to COVID-19, though I exhibited no symptoms, overwhelmed me. After all, I had been on airplanes less than two weeks before. The world had changed so dramatically.

My 90-year-old grandmother, who was immunocompromised, was experiencing shortness of breath that day. My mom drove down to Flossmoor and stood outside my grandmother’s window. She held up a sign that read “Love you.” Like me, my mother couldn’t physically be with her mother that day.

As my siblings and I talked with our mom over the phone, we heard the siren of an ambulance growing closer and louder. The louder it got, the more I knew the ambulance was coming for my grandma.

My grandma was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation and low potassium, and she was tested for COVID-19. Not allowed inside the hospital, my mom sat in the parking lot as rain poured down, staring at a single-wide trailer being used to process emergency room admissions as she texted updates to my siblings and me.

The next day, I learned that my grandma had tested positive for COVID-19. I talked to her over the phone while she laid in bed without family by her side. She told me how proud she was of me and to keep doing good in the world. I told her how much I loved her and that I would continue to do my best to make the world a better place. A feeling that this would be our last conversation hung over me as tears filled my eyes.

On April 2, I learned that feeling was right. My mom called to tell me that my grandma had passed away. I am so thankful that my mom was able, eventually, to physically be with grandma before she passed, and that members of the family near and far were able to speak with her over the phone.

I know my story is like so many others. Loved ones suffering, families unable to physically be with one another. We can’t hug the people we love, can’t hold their hand in silence, can’t kiss them on the cheek.

The lucky among us get to say “I love you” over the phone; others will never have that opportunity, never get to say goodbye.

While I hope the federal government does all it can to combat this crisis, there is no doubt in my mind that President Trump’s lack of preparedness, competency, urgency and empathy has caused pain and suffering for my family and for families across the country. The tears that filled my eyes after talking to my grandma for the last time reflected that pain and suffering.

I am rooting for our country, but the president’s poor response to the coronavirus has motivated me to double my efforts to see that he and all those who enable him are voted out of office come November.

On March 27, less than one week before she died from COVID19, my grandma — Ruth G. Johnston — told me to keep doing good in the world. Well, that’s exactly what I plan to do.

See you in November, Mr. President.

According to Apple’s announcement, the funding will help COPAN vastly scale up its production of testing kits, “expanding production from several thousand today to more than one million kits per week by early July.” Apple is also helping COPAN source and design new equipment for the company’s new facility in California.

“COPAN is one of the world’s most innovative manufacturers of sample collection kits for COVID-19 testing, and we’re thrilled to partner with them so they can expand as we work to address this critical issue for our nation,” commented Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a press release. “I couldn’t be prouder of our teams for bringing all of their energy, passion, and innovative spirit to supporting the country’s COVID-19 response.”

Apple’s latest efforts to contribute to the pandemic response

The funding joins Apple’s ongoing efforts to contribute to the global COVID-19 response. The company is also using its supply chain to source masks for health care workers, design and donate its own face shields, and develop a screening app and website with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most notably, there’s the company’s upcoming contact tracing system that it’s developing in a rare collaboration with Google to help track the spread of the virus.

Established in 2017, Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund was a $1 billion fund — later expanded to $5 billion — that exclusively focuses on investing in domestic manufacturing and job creation in the United States. It’s a move that many have speculated was designed to help win favor with President Donald Trump who has long expressed a desire that Apple move more of its production work — including its iPhone manufacturing — to the US.

While the $10 million award to COPAN is a drop in the bucket compared to the $5 billion fund, it’s still notable since Apple tends to reserve that fund for Apple suppliers in the United States. Past major allocations have included the $450 million Apple awarded to Corning (which produces the Gorilla Glass found in iPhones), $390 million to Finisar (which makes lasers used to enable Face ID on iPhones and proximity features on AirPods), and $10 million to the Elysis aluminum partnership (which supplies carbon-free aluminum to Apple).",real

Strommer.

On 15 May, an out-of-state seafood worker tested positive for Covid-19 in Dillingham, six weeks after Bristol Bay regional entities requested the State of Alaska that it shut down the commercial fishery in the region. The feared at that time was that the state would fail to ensure pre-arrival testing and enforced quarantine for incoming fishery participants. According to Alaska Public Media, it’s the ninth case of a non-resident testing positive for coronavirus in Alaska. The state's governor, Mike Dunleavy, is resisting closure of the highly lucrative Bristol Bay fishery, vowing to maintain anti-COVID protection measures. However, tribal leaders have grave doubts about how the state authorities can enforce these measures and require seasonal workers to observe quarantine.

Why COVID-19 Poses Severe Challenge to Bristol Bay

""The main threat is due to the influx of thousands of fishermen who can potentially infect the vulnerable population with COVID-19"", says Ambassador Ronald Barnes of the Indigenous Peoples and Nations Coalition (IPNC), Alaska. ""The fish processors and their crew are entering the Bristol Bay region with Essential Employee exemptions stated in their application to enter Alaska by the state of Alaska. The exemption references to social distancing, quarantines, curfews and other restrictions. This also leaves protocols determined by the fish processors and boat captains to regulate"".

Ambassador Barnes emphasises that the local communities and the regional hospital are not securely equipped with personal protective equipment (PPEs), testing and tracing, ventilators, hospital beds, police enforcement and other necessary protocols to ensure the prevention and protection of the local communities to COVID-19.

""Many of the Bristol Bay communities are separated and isolated and can only reach the Kanakanak Hospital by airplane or by boat"", he says. ""The hospital receives mainly federal funding from Washington and it is not enough to serve the health and safety needs to all communities"".

The Bristol Bay region has had no reported COVID cases until 15 May, when a Trident fish processing company worker from out of state tested positive in Dillingham, elaborates Geoffrey D. Strommer, a US lawyer specialising in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) implementation. Stressing that the fishery industry has already brought COVID-19 to villages in the region, he draws attention to the fact that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, 80% of the deaths in Alaska were Alaska Natives.

Even before the pandemic the health infrastructure of the Bristol Bay had not been constructed or staffed, or funded to cover thousands of seasonal workers: ""We already have huge unmet needs for health care funding, and this crisis only serves to highlight the disparities and shortages"", the lawyer underscores.

To complicate matters further, not all villages in Bristol Bay have running water or sewage and wastewater treatment facilities, he continues, adding that families often have to share very small housing units in overcrowded conditions which makes self-isolation almost impossible amid the pandemic.

Remote location makes life necessities hard to get and very expensive. Likewise, digital communications in the region cost quite a bit which dramatically diminish the affordability of telemedicine and distant educational services for Alaska Natives, the lawyer highlights.

According to some estimates there were 120,000 indigenous people in the state in 2013 which constitutes approximately 15.4% of the overall Alaskan population. ""Alaska Natives are the original inhabitants of the region, with knowledge of the resources, biology, terrain and lifeways to be able to live and thrive here since time immemorial"", Strommer emphasises, stressing that outside industries negatively impact ""local Alaska Natives' capacity to live a subsistence lifestyle"".

""Both the state and federal government, if they value what Bristol Bay brings to the regional and global economy through its fisheries, need to step up and invest further in local infrastructure so that the region has more substantial access to health care, housing, clean water and sewer, electricity, internet and mobile data, and education and law enforcement"", the attorney observes.

'Alaska Natives Have the Right to Govern Their Territories'

If the US state and federal government can't provide the indigenous people with protection and decent standards of living they should let Alaska Natives to take the reins of the region in terms of lawmaking, governance and natural resources management, argues Ambassador Ronald Barnes who has been spearheading the initiative of Alaska's self-determination and self-governance for several years.

""The lack of preparedness and infrastructure to provide enough health care is based on the failure to implement international legal and political status and obligations by the United States of America to Alaska"", he stresses. ""The US has and continues to exploit more than a trillion dollars of resource from Alaska"".

Referring to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and the 1867 Treaty of Cession of Alaska the ambassador emphasises that neither of these acts grant the US with the rights of jurisdiction and ownership of the region's territories. He underlines that these rights solely belong to the indigenous peoples of Alaska, in accordance with diplomatic communications between the Russian Empire and the US in which the Alaska indigenous people were declared as ""independent tribes inhabiting an independent territory"".

""The extraction of resources and unilateral taking of territory without the proper consent of a state of peoples based on the denial of self-determination and self-government on grounds of racial discrimination is a crime against humanity"", argues the ambassador. ""The Indigenous Peoples of Alaska have the right of full diplomatic recognition under the political question doctrine at high levels with the United States Government and with the international community"".

Five years ago, Ambassador Barnes raised the issue in the United Nations together with the representatives of indigenous populations of Hawaii. As both Alaska and Hawaii were listed in 1946 as Non Self-Governing Territories under article 73 of the UN Charter, this status subjected Alaska and Hawaii to ""decolonization"". Irregularities in the referendum on Alaska's status as the US' 49th state throw the Alaska Statehood Act signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in July 1958 into question and require the region's re-enlistment to the List of Non-Self-Governing Territories, according to Barnes.

In 2013 and 2014 the criteria for exercising the right of self-determination by Alaska Natives were laid down by Professor Alfred de Zayas, then UN Independent Expert on International Order, who argued that the peoples of Alaska can invoke the right. According to the professor, ""the US government's failure to provide Alaska Natives with adequate health services before and during the COVID pandemic is incompatible with Article 25 of the 1989 ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169, the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples, and general principles of international human rights law"".

Ambassador Ronald Barnes concludes: ""The denial to grant proper recognition and respect to the Tribal Governments and for their right to development, particularly in developing law and policy by the proper agents and authorities, is contrary to the obligations of the United States under Article 1 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"".

While Brazilian President Bolsonaro is pushing state governors to reopen businesses, the Latin American country reported a record 1,179 deaths and 17,408 new coronavirus cases in one day on 19 May. The president's controversial handling of the pandemic has prompted the opposition to step up calls for his impeachment. To date, Brazil’s lower house has received at least 30 impeachment requests, according to Bloomberg. In addition, in late April, Supreme Federal Court authorised an investigation of alleged corruption and obstruction of justice by the president. The decision was made after ex-Brazilian Justice Minister Sergio Moro accused Bolsonaro of firing a top police commander to shield his family from investigations, something that the president vehemently denies.

Bolsonaro's calls for reopening are only hindering Brazil's economic recovery, argues Gustavo Guerreiro, executive editor of the journal World Tensions and a member of the Brazilian Centre for Solidarity with Peoples and Fight for Peace (CEBRAPAZ) envisioning that the Latin American country is heading to a political crisis.

Sputnik: Brazil is among the world's least-tested countries when it comes to COVID-19. While the country has reported nearly 15,000 deaths and 220,000 cases so far, Domingos Alves of the Sao Palo University suggests that the number of infections could be at least 16 times higher. What's your take the unfolding situation? Would you agree that the actual numbers of those infected could be much higher?

Gustavo Guerreiro: The Brazilian government does not know the number of cases of infection spread throughout the country, let alone deaths. But this is a global reality, due to the great speed with which the virus has spread and the inability of the public sector to carry out extensive testing on the population.

This occurs both in Brazil, and in European countries, and even with the US, which may have an even greater number than what we see there. The point is that Brazil is one of the countries where the test for COVID-19 is least tested. There is also a great underreporting of deaths from COVID-19. Many people die with symptoms of the disease, but remain as suspected cases, as they have not been and will not be tested. I have no doubt that the reality must be even more serious than the study's estimate.

I do not doubt that Brazil will soon take second place, along with the US, with the highest number of cases and deaths from the disease. Interestingly, the two countries are governed by presidents who have scorned the severity of the disease. Bolsonaro manages to be even worse, because not only does he disregard isolation, but he stimulates agglomerations. This is not an ideological conviction motivated by the so-called herd immunisation, which in itself is absurd, but a sordid rejoicing in a policy of eugenics.

Sputnik: Has the Brazilian government so far developed any plan of how to handle the pandemic? What's your take on Bolsonaro's decision to open-up while the death toll is rising? What's behind this? Is he seeking to ""emulate"" Donald Trump?

Gustavo Guerreiro: There is no structural plan to deal with the pandemic. In Brazil, there is no figure of the central government, which coordinates integrated actions with the federal entities, as it should be.

The proposal to open up trade and economic activity is absurd. You cannot oppose life to the economy. Bolsonaro insists on blaming the governors and the idea of ​​confinement for the economic recession. The cause of the recession is the pandemic. Mass confinement, however paradoxical it may seem, is also a form of faster economic recovery. The less time a country spends facing the pandemic, the better for a return to productive activities. Stimulating the return to work in the middle of a pandemic means, in addition to the human tragedy, as the health system would not support it, an economic tragedy.

This behavior occurs because the president is committed to the elites' agenda. Much of the business community cares little that the working class is dying. Since labor and social security reform removed workers' rights and much of social protection, and since Labor Justice was reformed after the political coup against Dilma Rousseff, the worker became disposable.

Bolsonaro himself said that the death of a company was much mores serious than the death of an individual. Added to all this is the desire to imitate everything that occurs in the Trump administration, to whom Bolsonaro's government is unilaterally aligned, like a vassal.

Sputnik: Less than a month after Jair Bolsonaro sacked ex-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta the country's new health minister stepped down. What's the reason behind Dr. Nelson Teich's resignation?

Gustavo Guerreiro: Bolsonaro is often concerned about the prominence of the Ministry of Health, which at a moment of such gravity is robbing the president of his central role.

The departure of Health Minister Nelson Teich before completing a month in office is just one of the president's inconsequential acts, which has the support of the military around him. Teich did not resign as ""a life choice"", as he said, but due to an irrational clash over social isolation and protocols for using hydroxychloroquine. The president had determined that the drug can be used preventively and for mild symptoms. The minister, who is also a doctor, refused to put lives at risk, so he left.

The drug became an obsession for Bolsonaro, who uses it as a political argument to counter the social isolation actions taken by state governors. Bolsonaro ordered the Army Pharmaceutical Chemical Laboratory to produce medicine on a large scale (about 1.25 million pills) with raw material purchased from India. Bolsonaro took the hasty step without discussion with the Ministry of Health itself and with doctors and scientists, but the medication has not been used.

As hydroxychloroquine has its effectiveness questioned all over the world, as well as by the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency, Bolsonaro does not know what to do with all medication produced by the military, which constitutes an act of administrative impropriety and a crime of fiscal responsibility. To try to protect himself from the results of the deaths resulting from this folly, Bolsonaro issued Provisional Measure 966, which aims to exempt government officials from responsibility for the misuse of public resources and errors in performance during the pandemic.

Sputnik: Earlier Bolsonaro's Justice Minister Sérgio Moro withdrew from the government. Are these resignations a sign of a looming political crisis for the Bolsonaro's cabinet, in your opinion? What's your prognosis on how the political situation will unfold?

Gustavo Guerreiro: Sérgio Moro was the main supporter of his government. As a judge, Moro defrauded the criminal process that culminated in the illegal imprisonment of former President Lula, guaranteeing the election of Bolsonaro, who would lose to the then former president. As Bolsonaro has not joined any political party and is seeing his political support base crumble, he begins to cede positions to corrupt political forces, the so-called “centrão” (center parties). At the same time, he sees investigations against his family moving forward.

Former allies, such as Sérgio Moro himself and businessman Paulo Marinho have begun to expose the insides of the Bolsonaro family's corruption schemes. The National Congress is beginning to move towards an impeachment. In the bubbling political melting pot that Brazil has become, especially in the midst of a health crisis and an unprecedented economic crisis, there is no way to make accurate predictions. Anything can happen. Even a military coup can be considered. Brazil is going through one of its worst moments in republican history and it does not seem that things will improve.

Usually, when you run a vaccine experiment, there’s tons of red tape. There are ethical boards to consult and subjects to recruit. Then you have to convince people with money that your research is important enough to move forward at all. But now, there’s none of that. A vaccine for the coronavirus is at the top of the priority list, and everyone’s moving as fast as they can.

Dr. Kirsten Lyke is the lead investigator on COVID-19 vaccine trials at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. She’s worked on vaccines for years—some have panned out, and some haven’t. She knows trials like this one can take a long time, and she also knows that the vaccine she’s testing may not work at all. But she’s optimistic anyway, and hoping to have a vaccine in just a few short months.

On Thursday’s episode of What Next, I asked Lyke how this is even possible, and spoke with her about the accelerated timeline for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Right now, your vaccines are at the very earliest phase of human testing, called Phase 1.

Kirsten Lyke: A straightforward Phase 1 study is usually 40 to 50 subjects: volunteers who agreed to participate. And it may take anywhere from 12 to 18 months from the time we decide to do a study to ramp it up.

How does that compare with what you’re doing now?

We got a call from Pfizer around April 10 right requesting that we consider participation. We had our first Zoom meeting that Wednesday. It was essentially two weeks of round-the-clock work to get the study up and running, and then last week we put out the call to volunteers asking for recruits.

So are you saying that normally a process that could take a year took four weeks?

A month. That’s exactly what I’m saying.

Can you describe the room where you’re giving the vaccinations? Like, do you have a basement bunker?

It looks like your regular doctor’s office, where we have several individual rooms where we can put one volunteer at a time. But these are really unusual times. So everyone who comes to campus here in Maryland has to wear a mask. We meet them at the door and do a prescreening. We ask them if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or if they’ve had COVID 19, go through a list of questions to discern if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, and then do their temperature. Only then are they allowed to get a little golden ticket that allows them to enter the vaccine area.

For vaccination, it’s a process. The very first thing we do before is a nasal-pharyngeal swab, just like everyone around the country is getting. So within 45 minutes, we’ve determined whether they’re shedding the virus, and if they’re negative, we can go ahead and randomize and enter them into the system so that we can get them on the docket for vaccination.

It sounds like you feel like you’re on a clock.

We are on a clock. We’re on a very rapid sprint overlaying a marathon because every single week we have to recruit a number of volunteers to fill our docket for next week’s dose escalation. So we’re vaccinating this particular round while simultaneously recruiting for next week’s round, when we’ll go to the next dose.

How many vaccines a week are you giving?

We’re actually testing four different vaccines at three different dose levels. We’re also doing young people up to age 55. Then we’ll move to older people. Every one of those permutations needs 15 people. This is just, at this stage, a safety and immunity study. We’re looking at immune responses and testing the safety of each of these permutations of the vaccine.

The overarching design of the study is to test people from ages 18 to 85 and ultimately those with all sorts of risk factors for COVID-19: diabetes, hypertension, lung disease. But right now, in these very, very early stages, we’re testing just the 18- to 55-year-olds who are healthy. Come June, we’ll move to the older age group. Come July, we’re going to move to people who have other comorbidity conditions. And as we work our way along the ladder, we’ll cover the full panoply of people who are most at risk and need to have a vaccine.

One of the things that is helping for this particular scenario is that everything is shut down. At our center, it’s called severe restriction: We’re not allowed to do other studies or invite volunteers for any of our other ongoing studies. It’s prioritized as COVID-19 studies only.

So this is all you can work on.

For the most part, everything has been stalled. Anyone who has expertise in what we do is declared essential and allowed to be on campus to continue research. Everyone has been freed up of their day-to-day work to have time to concentrate on just doing this trial.

How do you speed things up without cutting corners? Even if you pour people into something, it still takes a toll to move so fast.

Obviously a COVID-19 vaccine has not been in people and has not really been in a lot of preclinical studies, where they go into different animals and officials do exhaustive testing. Mice have been injected and we have very limited data, but most of the data that was given to the FDA to move forward on this was with companion vaccines that had been made with the same platform but weren’t necessarily COVID-19-based vaccines.

So it’s the same method, but it’s not the same virus.

Right. So that may not fly in ordinary situations. But the FDA has agreed that the preponderance of evidence established that this was safe. We have safety data, but to some degree, it might not be the mountains of data that are typically generated before moving forward.

What kind of people are volunteering for this? I know you pay them, so there’s an incentive, but who’s going up and saying, “I want to be on the front lines of testing a pretty unproven vaccine”?

The good thing is that there are a lot of people at home who wanted to do something. Obviously there are people who need some money. But I would say overwhelmingly it’s not people looking for any compensation. Most tell me they’re going to donate their checks. It’s people from the community. It’s people maybe associated with the university but who aren’t in direct patient care.

Are you even really testing for how effective the vaccine is, or is it mostly just safety? I know that in a Phase 1 trial, you may look for a little bit of effectiveness, but you’re mostly just saying, can we do this?

“I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time it takes for society at large to develop immunity.” — Kirsten Lyke

Right now we’re interested predominantly in safety and also whether the immune response that’s mounted is actually specific to the virus and in a petri dish can neutralize the antibodies. We are collecting data so that if people develop COVID-like symptoms, we’ll have them do a self-swab and send it to us so we can collect all of that data. The length of the trial for people participating right now is actually 26 months, even though we hope we’ll have picked a vaccine and it’s gone into production well before that. You know, as early as this autumn, they’re still going to be participating and coming in for blood draws so we can see how long their antibody response lasts.

Like a lot of things when it comes to this coronavirus, with this vaccine, we are going to be learning a lot on the fly. Even if it’s proved safe and goes into production in the next few months, we might not know exactly how effective it is until after it gets released. There’s an element of taking it on faith. So what does effectiveness look like in a vaccine like this? I get the chickenpox vaccine and I don’t get that condition. Do you think we’re going to be able to promise that a vaccine we’re working on so quickly for a condition we’re really just learning the contours of?

There are so many unknowns that it’s impossible to say. I can say that this is what we hope for: that the vaccine we’re developing today is going to work and it’s going to cover people for a reasonable amount of time. And that is where what is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to someone else. Everyone has experience with the flu vaccine—every year we have to make a new crop of vaccines. The total overall efficacy differs year after year, 70 percent, 50 percent.

Sometimes it’s zero percent efficacy.

Sometimes it’s not effective at all. And that would not be acceptable. I mean, we’re hoping for a high level of protective efficacy in a virus that’s not mutating. That’s a lot to ask. We just don’t know how this is going to all play out. All we know is that there are other coronaviruses circulating, like the common cold—which isn’t a deathly illness. Hopefully this will morph into that. But I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time that it takes for society at large to develop immunity.

In you pre-pandemic work, you focused on diseases like dengue, which is caused by a virus, and malaria, which is caused by a parasite. We’ve been looking for a vaccine for those for years, and we still haven’t found anything, really.

That’s absolutely correct. Half a million people die of malaria a year. And there is no sense of urgency anywhere up and down the levels of vaccine development.

I wonder if it kind of makes you humbled looking at this coronavirus, with folks saying we want a vaccine in 18 months. You know how hard the work is.

Malaria is a different beast. It is very, very difficult to develop a vaccine because it’s so complicated. The beauty of viruses is they’re so simple—they can’t even replicate themselves. HIV is an exception because it morphs and changes genetically. It’s constantly evolving, so it’s hard to keep up. But Ebola, for example, is a simple virus. It can’t mutate that quickly because it typically ended up killing people before it had a chance to mutate. So it was relatively easy to make a vaccine, and we’re kind of hoping the same thing with COVID-19, not to minimize the difficulty.

You sound so confident!

Well, I think we’re going to get it. I mean, there are a hundred companies claiming they have a vaccine that they want to bring to fruition. We just happen to have been part of a process that had the financial means and the infrastructure to get it off the ground very quickly. So I hope this one works, but I also hope other vaccines work because by the time we get to autumn and start ramping up production, I don’t think one company is going to be able to develop worldwide mass production immediately.

A senior MP has described it as thing that “should not be repeated”.

The Finnish Parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committees plan to voice their displeasure over key information about their country's cooperation with Sweden and NATO being withheld from them, national broadcaster Yle reported.

The committee members claim they were kept in the dark about an agreement drawn up between Finland, Sweden and NATO in 2018 which boosted information exchange and dialogue in crisis situations, despite the fact that foreign and security policy matters, as well as military cooperation are within their respective committees' jurisdiction.

According to the agreement, which in government circles has been referred to as an “arrangement”, Finland, Sweden and NATO can separately agree to increased information exchange and dialogue in times of crises, Yle reported. The country holding the information or the military alliance would be able to decide whether or not to share it.

However, despite the arrangement being agreed upon in 2018, neither committee found out about it until February of this year. According to Yle's informed sources, its terms had never previously been disclosed to MPs and even the very existence of the arrangement had not been previously publicised. The arrangement was reportedly classified as “secret” by NATO and was assigned the highest security classification in Finland.

A Yle source described withholding information from the committees as a serious matter. In effect, parliament did not know everything that Finland was committed to.

When the arrangement was concluded, Timo Soini was Foreign Minister and Jussi Niinistö was Defence Minister. Since then, Soini has quit politics, whereas Niinistö has switched parties. The then-government led by former ex-Centre Party leader Juha Sipilä was privy to the arrangement, as was the current government led by Sanna Marin of the Social Democrats.

Both committees have yet to evaluate the implications of the arrangement in political and military terms. The analysis has been slowed down by the novel coronavirus epidemic . However, the committees say they are planning a joint statement to the Constitutional Law Committee on Parliament’s right of access to information.

One anonymous source described the arrangement as “harmless” and underlined “mutual benefits”. Another one ventured it was not as significant as the Host Nation agreement, which lays the foundation for technical compatibility in case Finland receives NATO troops during drills or in crisis situations.

Nevertheless, former Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee, hinted at his displeasure in a Facebook post. While calling the overall performance “commendable”, he said there was a “more serious case that should not be repeated”.

Finland and Sweden, while formally non-aligned, have both in recent years been drawn closer to NATO, having stepped up cooperation with the US as well. Pundits described this peculiar state as “post-neutral” and “pre-allied”.",fake
1219,724,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-high-school-juniors-could-be-big-losers-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-5,2020-05-09,Why high school juniors could be big losers in the coronavirus pandemic,"High school juniors may find themselves at a disadvantage when they apply to college next year.

With many current seniors looking to defer college admission for a year, there may be less spots available for the class of 2021.

Juniors are also set to miss out on the activities that often help distinguish an application, like extracurriculars and jobs.

Low-income students may be disproportionately impacted, especially if SAT testing moves online.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The coronavirus pandemic has thrown many current and soon-to-be collegiate careers into disarray, but some of the biggest losers have been a relative afterthought so far: the juniors who haven't even applied yet.

The reason why has to do with all the seniors who, heading into an uncertain collegiate future, may opt to take a gap year instead of enrolling as planned.

""Almost all of my students who have been admitted to top-tier colleges are reconsidering their plans for this upcoming academic year, with some submitting gap year request forms to delay the start of their freshman year so that they can have the full college experience,"" college admissions consultant Christopher Rim, the CEO of Command Education, previously told Business Insider.

If schools open online in the fall, 12% of high school seniors will take a gap year, according to a survey of 1,100 current high school seniors and college students by higher-ed research and marketing firm SimpsonScarborough.

And, according to a Niche survey of 34,392 high school seniors, 7% of school seniors are considering deferring for a year or not enrolling.

For other students, deferring or not attending next year may not be much of a choice. International students, for instance, face ever-changing travel restrictions. Foreign nationals traveling from China currently aren't allowed to enter the US — and China was the largest source of international students in the 2018-2019 school year.

All of those students deferring admission — and the international students who may not be allowed to travel — will hypothetically matriculate in 2021. That means that the class of 2021 could be competing with two years' worth of high schoolers for a college spot — and the class of 2020 has already secured theirs.

Fewer college enrollments in the fall — coupled with cancelled extracurriculars and opportunities — spells trouble for juniors

""The reality is that there's going to be fewer enrollments and fewer graduates, and it's going to take time to get that back on track,"" Luke Skurman, CEO and founder of Niche, told Business Insider in an email. ""Our recent survey shows that half of high school students are rethinking their college options and 9% are considering deferring their acceptance. That, combined with 26% of college students considering transferring or taking time off could lead to a devastating fall — but opens up the possibility of a much larger than usual spring and fall 2021 enrollment size for institutions who can weather the budgetary pain of the fall.""

Of course, as Rim previously noted, it's ""unclear"" how colleges will handle gap year requests — and what students would even be able to do during a deferred year.

Further compounding the plight of the juniors is the loss of what Rim calls a ""hook"" — something that helps them stand apart in an already crowded field. For many, that comes in the form of research or extracurriculars — most of which have been cancelled due to coronavirus closures. SAT tests have been cancelled through August, meaning students will get fewer opportunities to take the test or try and raise their scores.

And lower-income students will likely be disproportionately impacted. In losing access to school buildings and libraries, they may have lost their only chance of using a quiet study space and computer. Even having one computer may not be helpful if students need to share it with a parent working from home.

The Pew Research Center found that racial minorities, rural residents, and those with lower education and income levels are less likely to have internet connectivity. That could have devastating repercussions for prospective college applicants or SAT test-takers if tests move online.

As Rim notes, many lower-income students receive SAT tutoring through public schools. If tests do resume in-person in August, they'll still be left behind by the absence of that tutoring. And, while many schools have moved to make SAT tests optional for 2021 admissions, those lower-income students who do not send in scores will find themselves going head to head with more well-resourced students who did.

All of that adds up to a bleak picture for juniors: they'll have fewer opportunities to hone the profile that colleges look for — like jobs and extracurriculars — and will find themselves competing for a reduced amount of seats. And, in an already pitched battle to ensure equal access to opportunities in college, exaggerated socioeconomic differences during the crisis can make it harder for the ""have-nots"" to access good colleges.

The plight of the juniors only further illustrates the tentacle effect of the coronavirus pandemic: the aftershocks will shape American lives for years to come.",real
1222,339,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/style/how-to-handwash-your-clothes.html,2020-04-16,How to Handwash Your Clothes,"
Laundromats have been deemed essential businesses in cities and states that have issued stay-at-home orders to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But many laundry business owners have chosen to close for the safety of their employees, leaving those who rely on laundromats without access to washing machines and dryers.
Even if your local laundromat is still operating, you may choose to wash clothes at home to avoid being exposed to other people. Here’s how to do it.
Prepare your stationStep 1First, you’ll need to determine where this operation will take place: Washing clothes by hand requires a clean space roomy enough to fully submerge your garments in water. For most people, the kitchen sink will be the best place for hand laundering, but a utility sink, a roomy bathroom sink, the bathtub or a washing basin are also options.
Clean the sink with an all-purpose cleaner and fill it with water, leaving enough room for your clothes and hands to move around inside. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s current recommendations regarding laundry and coronavirus are to use the hottest water temperature a garment can tolerate. (Check the label.) And you can wear gloves if it’s more comfortable.
sudsStep 2Add 1 teaspoon of regular liquid or powder detergent for each pound of clothing you wash. (Neil Lant, a research fellow at Procter & Gamble who is focused on fabric care, said that on average three items of adult-sized clothing weigh about a pound.) Be careful not to use too much detergent, as it will make the rinsing process exceedingly long and is likely to leave behind residue that can cause skin irritation.
A no-rinse detergent like Soak Wash is a great option because it removes a step from the process. You should never puncture a detergent pack for hand laundering; the detergent that is sold in packs is highly concentrated, and it poses a risk if it comes in contact with the eye, either from being squirted out of a pack or from the detergent being transferred from the hands to the eyes.
While detergents designed specifically for hand laundering provide easy-to-follow dosage guidelines, it can be trickier to determine how much regular laundry detergent to use.
SwirlStep 3Add clothes to the detergent solution and submerge them fully. Use your hands to mimic the agitation of a washing machine. Move the garments by swirling and pumping them in the detergent solution so that it can penetrate the fibers.
SoakStep 4Once the garments are submerged, allow them to soak in the solution for 15 to 60 minutes, depending on how visibly dirty the fabric is.
DRAIN AND RINSEStep 5Drain the detergent solution and wipe the sink free of any suds, then refill the sink with clean cool or lukewarm water to begin rinsing. Using your hands, agitate the clothes to release detergent, draining the water and repeating until they are fully rinsed. Sturdier fibers like polyester and cotton can be rinsed directly under running water, though you should avoid rinsing delicate items like hosiery or fine scarves directly under a running tap.
DryStep 6After the final rinse, drain the sink, move the clothing to one side and, one by one, press down on each garment to extrude the water held in its fibers. Do not wring the fibers, which can cause stretching or other damage. The first press, so to speak (it’s like making wine!), is just with hands, in the sink, to push out as much water as possible without wringing.
If you have a clean, dry towel to spare, lay the clothing flat on the towel and roll the towel and piece of clothing up together, jelly roll style. The combination of pressing out the water and rolling the item in a dry towel will leave it only damp, rather than dripping wet, which will speed up drying time. If you don’t have a clean towel to spare, but you do have a salad spinner, it can be used to extrude water from smaller items like socks, underwear or T-shirts.
Allow the clothing to air dry by laying it flat, using a drying rack or line drying it if that is an option.
As far as outdoor drying goes, the same rules apply as for exposure to people, said Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If the clothes are more than 6 feet away from an infected person’s sneezing or coughing droplets, they are safe to line dry.
“It is unlikely coronavirus is floating through the air outside,” said Dr. Menachery. “Now if your neighbor is sick and coughs out the window less than 6 feet away from you hanging clothes, then they might be contaminated.”
Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, echoed that opinion in an email: “The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not airborne. It is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces.”
If you do not have a drying rack or if space in your home is limited, wet clothes can be put on plastic hangers and hung from a shower curtain rod to drip-dry.
Tips and tricksCheck the weather and, if you have outdoor space, do your wash on a dry day. Even if you will be drying clothes indoors, lower air-moisture levels will help your items dry faster.Working in small batches — 3 to 4 days worth of clothes — will make the process much easier, and will not leave every surface of your home covered in drip-drying pieces.Bulky items like towels and sheets can be difficult to wash and even more difficult to dry, especially for those without access to outdoor space for line dying. Instead of washing them, spot treat any stains and then steam them, which will freshen and clean them. You can also extend bed linen use by laundering pillowcases only, which are smaller and less cumbersome to wash and dry by hand.",real

As he slowly recovers from a near-death bout of COVID-19, the disease brought on by the coronavirus, at an acute care hospital near San Antonio, Wilkins and his loved ones face a new worry: states pushing to reopen stores and economies.

""People don’t really understand how serious this is until they know somebody who's going through it,"" said Rebecca Patterson, Wilkins' longtime girlfriend. ""It's only a matter of time before everyone in the country knows someone.""

She added, ""I don’t know what the solution is, but I don’t think hurrying to open things up is it.""

Thousands of coronavirus survivors are returning home after long, harrowing hospital stays to face lingering symptoms, job losses, staggering medical bills and stigma attached to surviving the virus that has infected roughly 1.5 million people in the USA and killed nearly 90,000.

Coronavirus may last 2 years, study warns: And its second wave could be worse

Many worry that states rushing to rescind stay-at-home orders and allow businesses to reopen will unleash a new wave of infections.

The debate over how fast states should reignite their economies flared last week when Dr. Rick Bright, a government immunologist, told a congressional committee that the window is closing fast to prevent the “darkest winter in modern history” if the nation doesn’t improve its response to the coronavirus.

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his federal post in retaliation for his views. President Donald Trump called Bright an ""angry, disgruntled employee"" and has continued pushing states to reopen and rekindle the struggling economy.

Leaders in some states, including Wisconsin and Texas, advocated for the reopening of small businesses with the same guidelines as essential services, such as supermarkets, even as their COVID-19 cases mount.

Last week, the Wisconsin Supreme Court eliminated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order, prompting patrons to stream into bars and restaurants across the state.

""Do we need statewide rules for the run-of-the-mill opening of restaurants or small retailers? I don’t think so,” state Rep. Joan Ballweg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Dashauna Ballard, 28, an educator from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said state officials would slow the pace of reopenings if they'd been through a COVID-19 scare. Ballard tested positive for the disease in early April after experiencing body aches, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She drove herself to a hospital and spent eight hours in the intensive care unit as doctors debated putting her on a ventilator.

Her breathing improved the next day, and she was released. Her job working with at-risk high school students was suspended, and school officials were wary of letting her return to campus to collect her personal items after learning she had contracted the virus, she said. Some friends have been reluctant to meet with her after discovering she had COVID-19.

Despite the stigma and uncertain economic future, Ballard said she's glad to be feeling better and recovering at her mother's home in Selma. She's worried states will reopen too soon.

""You are just potentially making the problem worse,"" Ballard said. ""It's not something you'll want to go through. ... You don’t want to feel that feeling of your breath taken away when you bend down to tie your shoes. You don't want to go through that, no matter what age you are.""

Dr. Omar Maniya, an emergency medicine resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has seen both sides of the pandemic. Working in the hospital's emergency department, he's treated almost 200 COVID-19 patients, seen them struggling to breathe and had scores of them die on his shift.

One day in early March, Maniya woke up with chills, body aches and a fever that spiked to 102. As was the protocol at the time, he stayed home for a week, until his symptoms passed, then returned to work. He tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign that he probably had the disease.

Maniya said he's worried that as states reopen, they'll experience the surge that hit New York, which leads the nation in confirmed cases (350,000) and deaths (28,000).

""I fear that many people around the country not experiencing this in their state are rolling their eyes thinking, 'It's not going to happen here,' "" Maniya said. ""A majority of states still have rising cases every day. I don’t think this is, by any means, under control.""

Virginia Bennett, 77, is an active grandmother of four. She shuttled between her home in Indiana and her winter home in Naples, Florida, and took line dancing classes five days a week.

In mid-March, she felt suddenly ill in Naples and went to a hospital. X-rays showed her lungs ravaged by the virus. Doctors moved her to an ICU and placed her on a ventilator immediately, where she spent the next 36 days. Family members had no access to her, relying on twice-a-day phone updates from doctors and nurses.

Slowly, in early May, she began to improve and was released from the hospital May 8. Masked doctors, nurses and technicians applauded as Bennett was wheeled out of the hospital to the sounds of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" playing on the hospital PA system.

Bennett was transferred to another critical care hospital, where she would begin her long recovery from the disease, daughter Jennifer Grytza said. Doctors said Bennett might be at her new hospital for several more months.

Before COVID-19 nearly took her mom's life, Grytza, a sales manager at a hotel chain who lost her job early in the pandemic, said she believed states should reopen as soon as possible. Now, she's not so sure.

""I know people need to get back to work,"" she said. ""I want to say, 'Let's reopen, but do it with caution and sensitivity to your neighbors and friends.' ""

Alice Police, a Westchester, New York, breast cancer surgeon, thought she could ride out the virus at home in late March when she was hit with flu-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. As her condition worsened, she was admitted to a hospital in early April.

Doctors discovered Police was experiencing what's known as a ""cytokine storm,"" in which the body releases a surge of immune responses to combat a virus, a condition that could turn deadly.

“It’s like a thunderstorm for the body,” Police, 66, said. ""It’s where the body is basically willing to kill you to kill the virus.”

Police was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was never intubated but struggled to breathe. She suffered from anxiety attacks, especially at night. After a few days, her condition improved, and five days later, she was released from the hospital. Later, symptoms reemerged, and Police returned to the hospital for a plasma infusion.

Recovering at home, she said she feels the country and its leaders are not taking the contagion seriously enough.

“This push to reopen is very, very wrong and short-sighted,” Police said. “The second wave could be worse.”

As the coronavirus began its explosive spread across New York City in March, Wilkins, 62, a well-known trombonist in New York, chose to ride out the pandemic with his mother and relatives in his hometown of San Antonio. In late March, he complained of congestion and fatigue but thought it was allergies flaring up.

On April 4, he texted Patterson, his longtime girlfriend, to tell her he felt ""much better."" Two hours later, Wilkins was rushed to the hospital, unresponsive, and immediately placed on a ventilator.

""It just escalated so quickly,"" Patterson said.

For the next 30 days, Wilkins was heavily sedated and struggling to breathe. The recipient of a kidney transplant six years ago, his only working kidney failed, and he had to be placed on dialysis. His white blood cell count shot up, and his blood pressure plummeted. He received a tracheotomy to make it easier for air to enter his lungs.

Doctors called Patterson to tell her Wilkins might not make it through the day. She rushed to the hospital and spoke to him from the nurse's station via a walkie talkie that a nurse held up to Wilkin's ear in his room.

""Hang in there,"" Patterson told him. ""I know it's not your time, and we'll be hanging out again soon.""

Slowly, in early May, his condition began to improve. He was able to breathe on his own and was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital in nearby New Braunfels. Thursday, he took his first bite of solid food in over a month.

Patterson said she doesn't know how soon Wilkins can return to his music career or whether there will be much of an industry left when he does. Wilkins, an Air Force veteran, has health insurance underthe Department of Veterans Affairs,but Patterson suspects it won't cover most of his medical bills, which she expects will be staggering. She started a GoFundMe.com site and personal website to try to raise money to cover his medical expenses.

Patterson relishes Wilkins' small victories, such as forming a few words using a Passy-Muir speaking valve and regaining the use of his fingers.

""It doesn't matter how old you are,"" she said. ""It's a serious disease with long-term effects.""

Ayatollah Khamenei would have led the Eid prayers at the Imam Khomeini Grand Prayer Grounds in Tehran as in the past, but the event was cancelled due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Nevertheless, Eid prayers were held in 110 mosques in the capital under strict health protocols.

Alireza Zali, the head of the National Headquarters for Managing and Fighting the coronavirus in Tehran, asked those with COVID-19 symptoms, people over 65, pregnant women as well as those suffering from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and uncontrolled blood pressure to skip going to public places for Eid prayers.

The region's rivals see it as a growth opportunity.,"San Francisco Bay Area.

Coronavirus is prompting some tech workers to consider leaving the Bay Area.

They're betting that permanent work-from-home policies will become more and more popular — lessening the troubled region's allure.

Some realtors in other smaller cities across the Western US say they've seen an uptick in interest from Bay Area residents looking to decamp.

And regional organisations and preparing to launch programs to attract remote workers to their states.

Coronavirus has some tech workers reconsidering their commitment to the San Francisco Bay Area.

The region's high cost of living, traffic, and housing crisis have long been pain points for professionals in the technology industry headquartered there — but now offices closures and work-from-home policies are prompting a renewed questioning of whether it's still worth it.

With companies like Twitter announcing that it will allow employees to work remotely even after pandemic lockdowns lift for good, some industry-watchers are predicting the city will rapidly lose its luster as workers decamp for more appealing locales.

In conversations with Business Insider, realtors in smaller cities say they're seeing increased interest from potential Bay Area buyers, regional development groups are scrambling to put out the welcome mats for remote workers, and investors are said to be looking to capitalize on the trend.

Balaji Srinivasan, a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur, predicted on Twitter that the lockdown and new work-from-home policies are removing some of the few incentives left for people to stay in the Bay Area. ""The office isn't used, the industry is going remote. So SF is just pure repulsion. And people will fly away,"" he wrote.

The prohibitive cost of living in the Bay Area and lack of housing stock has already forced many — particularly younger generations — to consider relocating in recent years, said Skylar Olsen, senior principal economist at real estate listing firm Zillow. If permanent work-from-home policies become more and more prevalent post-lockdown, that may well accelerate the trend.

The multimillion-dollar question is whether that will translate into workers moving out to the suburbs, or going further afield.

Even if they can work remotely, workers are still likely to favour metropolitan areas with access to creature comforts over more far-flung locales: think a condo in downtown Bozeman, Montana rather than a cabin in the depths of Kootenai National Forest. ""Our value we place on amenity-rich, walkable neighborhoods is still really high,"" she said, and that's unlikely to change after the lockdown lifts.

Real estate listing site Realtor.com said they saw a surge in people Bay Area looking for listings elsewhere as lockdowns came into affect. ""The Bay Area's balance of within-metro and outbound home searches tipped substantially toward outbound starting in mid-March,"" spokesperson Cody Horvat said. ""The share of traffic from the Bay Area looking outside of the area jumped up 3.4 percent in April compared to the same period last year, marking the largest jump in outbound traffic share so far in 2020.""

That surge has since subsided, and the areas that saw the most interest from Bay Area users were Los Angeles and Riverside in California, Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.

It's hard to quantify any potential lockdown-influenced increase in sales this early, with deals typically taking a month or more to close. But Tony Levison, a realtor in picturesque Bend, Oregon, said he's seen an uptick recently in interest from Bay Area buyers.

""It's a direct flight to most of the major cities on the West Coast ... you can get anywhere pretty fast, and you don't have ot deal with the city lifestyle any more. Lots of outdoor activities, smaller town, and for a lot of people in the major cities, it's a lot more affordable, too.""

In Bozeman, Montana, Noel Seeburg, a realtor with Bozeman Real Estate Group, also said he's seen some increased interest — in particular from investors looking to buy up properties to rent to workers who might be relocate.

In Nevada — home to beautiful Lake Tahoe and bustling Reno — the government-backed Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) is actively developing a new program in response to coronavirus to try and attract new remote workers to the state, Mike Kazmierski, the organization's CEO said, to be rolled out after the lockdowns lift.

""There's no need for that workforce, regardless of the lockdown, to be stuck with high prices, traffic, all those other issues ... associated with California, when they can do the exact same job 30 minutes away from a ski slope.""

That said, there's at least one group predictably confident that the Bay Area won't lose its allure any time soon: San Francisco realtors.

Mariana Pappalardo, a realtor with Sotheby's, said she's seen some uptick in interest in people looking to get out of the city (one client is ""more motivated than ever to get out of here and move to Tahoe"") but predicted that work from home won't become the norm.

""Eventually, people are going to want to see people in the office,"" she said. ""I think this trend of working remotely is going to be popular for a year, tops, and then the shareholders are gonna want to see some faces.""

Plus, she added, San Francisco's incredibly dense network of talent will long continue to be a major draw.

""We have such a strong population ... nine out of ten of my clients have a PhD, where else do you get that? Those people are going to move to Montana and be bored out of their minds.""

Tesla’s plans to reopen its California factory are not in compliance with a local health order.
Tesla has told employees it intended to restart its factory in Fremont, Calif., on Friday. But the electric car company’s plans do not comply with a local government order that has not yet cleared large manufacturers to resume operations.
The company informed employees of the plan in company emails that were reviewed by The New York Times. The emails were sent after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said manufacturing companies could resume operations even as other businesses were to stay closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The governor also said that local governments could impose tougher restrictions than those that apply statewide.
A coalition of health officials from six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area and the City of Berkeley have chosen to maintain to stricter limits in their most recent order, issued on May 4.
That order allowed construction, landscaping, agricultural and other outdoor businesses to resume operations, but restaurants, bars or other indoor businesses “that do not permit physical distancing or have high-touch equipment” must remain closed.
“Tesla has been informed that they do not meet these criteria and must not reopen,” Neetu Balram, a spokeswoman for Alameda County, said in a statement.
Tesla representatives did not respond to a request for comment.April’s job losses highlight the depth of the pandemic’s devastation.
The Labor Department said Friday that the economy shed more than 20.5 million jobs in April, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7 percent — devastation unseen since the Great Depression.
The report underscores the speed and depth of the labor market’s collapse as the coronavirus pandemic took a devastating toll. In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, a half-century low.
The April job losses alone far exceed the 8.7 million in the last recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. The only comparable period came when the rate reached about 25 percent in 1933, before the government began publishing official statistics.
If anything, the report understates the damage. The government’s definition of unemployment typically requires people to be actively looking for work. And the unemployment rate does not reflect the millions still working who have had their hours slashed or their pay cut.
Women are embracing a natural appearance in lockdown.ImageSales of higher-end beauty products sold through department stores and retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora dropped about 14 percent in the first quarter.Credit...Taylor Johnson for The New York Times
The coronavirus shutdowns have upended many daily routines, including those around beauty, skin care and hair care.
Some people are taking matters into their own hands, sending sales of do-it-yourself hair color kits, hair trimmers and nail polish soaring at retailers like Walmart and Hy-Vee, a Midwest grocery store chain, in recent weeks.
But other people have simply stopped morning makeup regimens. For beauty companies and retailers, the combination of store closures and consumers who see little need to put on blush or mascara when they’re stuck at home is a serious issue.
In late March, E.L.F. Beauty said it saw a “significant decline” in retail sales in the last two weeks of that month. The company’s stock is down 40 percent since mid-February. Sales at Estée Lauder Companies dropped 11 percent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. Its stock is down 20 percent since mid-February.
Sales of higher-end beauty products through department stores and retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora dropped about 14 percent in the first quarter, said Larissa Jensen, a vice president at the NPD Group, a research firm.
But sales of skin-care products had been on the uptick for the last three years, Ms. Jensen said. And in recent weeks, sales of skin-care products surpassed makeup sales for the first time ever, she said.
Apple plans to reopen a few U.S. stores next week.
Apple said on Friday that it would reopen stores in four states next week, instituting temperature checks for customers and employees and limiting the number of people inside each store at any given time.
The company will also provide face coverings for customers who want them.In March, Apple had closed more than 450 of its stores, or nearly every location outside of China, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. In recent weeks, it has begun to slowly reopen some stores, including in Australia, Austria and South Korea.
Next week, the company will add stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina to that list, starting with its store in Boise on Monday. It has six stores in those states, but an Apple spokesman said not all would open next week.
The E.U. laid out its rules on how governments can take stakes in local companies.
The European Union said on Friday that governments in the bloc would have to restrict dividends, share buybacks and bonus payments at companies that receive economic relief in the form of a stake sale or certain kinds of debt.
“As the crisis evolves, many businesses will also need capital to stay afloat,” the E.U.’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. “If member states decide to step in, we will apply today’s rules to ensure that taxpayers are sufficiently remunerated and their support comes with strings attached.”
A government should only buy a stake in a business if there is no other option, the E.U. said, and any “aid must be limited to enabling the viability of the company.”
The plan to allow stake sales came hours after Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said the European Union should deploy more financial firepower to help the worst-hit members.
“If not all countries are cured from this crisis, the others will suffer — and not just in terms of health, but economically too,” Ms. Lagarde said at an event organized by the European University Institute.
Countries may need to issue as much as 1.5 trillion euros, or $1.6 trillion, in new debt to pay for corporate loan guarantees, unemployment subsidy programs and other measures to keep their economies afloat, Ms. Lagarde said. That is three times as much as European Union leaders have jointly committed so far.
Rent payments are holding up this month, a landlords’ group reports.
Apartment rent collections are surprisingly strong so far this month, with an industry survey showing that a vast majority of tenants have made payments.
Through the first six days of May, 80.2 percent of tenants paid at least some of their rent, compared with 81.2 percent a year earlier, according to a survey of 11.4 million apartments by the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for large apartment owners. That was better than the first week of April, when 78 percent of tenants paid some or all of their rent. By the end of the month, the figure had risen to almost 95 percent.
A similar story has played out in state surveys and corporate earnings reports, with publicly traded apartment companies reporting strong rent collections in April and May.
Government stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits appear to have helped backstop consumer finances. Still, there are concerns about the trade-offs that low-income renters must make to pay their rent, and how long they can continue to do so with millions of new unemployment claims filed each week.
Two Democrats, Representative Denny Heck of Washington and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, introduced bills on Friday providing $100 billion to cover about six months of housing costs for tenants. “This bill will help tenants pay their rent, without placing the burden on landlords,” Mr. Heck said in a statement.
The handling of the Paycheck Protection Program was faulty, inspector.The Small Business Administration’s inspector general said on Friday that flaws in how the agency put the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program into place were likely to have left rural, minority and women-owned businesses unable to get loans and could leave thousands of borrowers saddled with debt.
The report represents the first formal review of the embattled Paycheck Protection Program, which is the centerpiece of the government’s economic relief effort. The program, created as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act, has funneled billions of dollars to firms struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, but has been criticized for favoring bigger businesses and for complex requirements that are out of step with economic realities.
According to the inspector general’s report, the S.B.A. did not issue guidance to ensure that lenders would prioritize underserved communities, as required by law.
The report also highlights another concern that has gripped borrowers: the S.B.A.’s rule that 75 percent of loan proceeds be used to cover payroll costs and 25 percent go overhead costs such as rent.
Because so many businesses will remain shuttered after the eight-week loan period, and because many workers have opted to take more generous unemployment insurance benefits, businesses are fearful that they will be unable to spend enough of the loan money on payroll. In that event, parts of the loans would not be forgiven, saddling the borrowers with debt.
Demand has dropped sharply for small-business loans to cover payroll.
Nearly two weeks after the Paycheck Protection Program began making its second round of loans, nearly 40 percent of the funds remain unclaimed — surprising lenders who thought the money would vanish fast.
Just over $185 billion of the program’s $310 billion had been allocated as of Thursday evening, the Small Business Administration said in its latest report. Intended to help small companies keep their workers employed, the program offers a forgivable loan to cover eight weeks of payroll and certain other operating expenses, like rent.
But growing concern among business owners over the program’s complex and still-changing rules has damped demand. Some who took the cash are sitting on it. Those who do not spend the money on payroll will not have the loan forgiven, saddling them with a large debt during an economic collapse. For many owners, though, hiring back workers in the face of so much uncertainty does not make sense.
Carrie Morey owns Callie’s Hot Little Biscuit, a small group of restaurants in Atlanta, Charleston and Charlotte, N.C. She got a loan in the paycheck program’s second round, but is hoping for rule changes to make it more flexible. She would like to have a much longer period to bring back workers and still have her loan forgiven.
“Even if tomorrow everything were fine and we were to go back to business as usual, it’s going to take months for us to get customers to come in the door,” Ms. Morey said Thursday at a virtual gathering of business owners.
Stocks rally as investors look past staggering unemployment figures.
Stocks rose on Friday, following global markets higher after upbeat comments from U.S. and Chinese officials about recent trade talks between the two countries.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 1 percent. European markets were higher after a broadly positive day in Asia.
Investors were cheered by the prospects of countries further reopening their economies, despite worries that those efforts could lead to a rise in infections. They were also bolstered by announcements from the United States and China that appeared to back their Phase 1 trade deal, which would bring their two-year trade war to a temporary truce. The White House had openly questioned China’s commitment to the deal in recent days, hurting stocks.
The optimism was widespread. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds, which generally rise in troubled times, were lower. Oil prices also rose.
But more grim economic data was released on Friday. The report on April payrolls in the United States is showed a loss of more than 20.5 million jobs — a breathtaking drop — and a sharp jump in the unemployment rate. Corporate earnings reports, too, are reflecting the heavy toll of the pandemic. Siemens, the European industrial giant, said profit fell 64 percent in the first quarter.
The stock market has shown a remarkable indifference to the dire outlook for the economy since it began to rally on March 23. That was the day the Federal Reserve signaled that it stood ready to pump an unlimited amount of dollars into financial markets to keep key borrowing markets from malfunctioning.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Bed Bath & Beyond announced plans for a phased-in approach to reopen approximately 20 stores by May 22, but the majority of stores would remain closed until at least May 30. The company plans to promote store safety with hand sanitizer and wipes, occupancy limits, social distancing and curbside pickup. Bed Bath & Beyond also owns Buybuy Baby and Harmon Face Values, which sell essential goods and have remained open during the pandemic.The German airline Lufthansa said Friday it would resume flights next month to popular European holiday destinations like the Mediterranean islands of Mallorca and Crete, and Sylt in the North Sea. Starting June 1, Lufthansa will double the number of aircraft in service, to 160.The electronics and engineering giant Siemens, a bellwether for the German economy, reported that first-quarter profit fell by more than half as new orders slumped. Siemens said that sales had slipped a modest 1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2019. But new orders fell 9 percent largely because of lower demand for passenger trains. Profit fell 64 percent.Reporting and research was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Conor Dougherty, Gregory Schmidt, Jack Nicas, Nelson D.

But the coronavirus has thwarted her plans at every turn.

Senter and her husband, Gene, booked a trip from home in Indianapolis to Daytona Beach, Florida, for early May. When the chances of the city reopening by that pointseemed remote, she rebooked for June 15, assuming the pandemic would have played out by then. Now with that date a few weeks away, she figures there's still a heightened chance of contracting COVID-19. That's a risk she's unwilling to take as caregiver to her 90-year-old mother.

""I keep trying to tell myself so many people have it way worse off than we do,"" said Senter, who worries she may lose the $1,000 in reservations she has plunked down already. ""But that doesn't discount my feelings. I am disappointed.""

Other families are facing the same tough decisions about their vacations this year.

A visit to the Eastern shore is a rite of summer for many. From Maine to Florida, Atlantic beach towns attract visitors ready to frolic in the waves, savor fries or frozen custard on the boardwalk or simply soak up rays under a beach umbrella.

But this year, fears of the coronavirus are throwing plans by the wayside. Those who considered the annual trek to East Coast beaches as fundamental as visiting family at Thanksgiving are being forced to reconsider.

The fears go beyond simply a higher risk of catching the virus. Inconsistent policies by states and communities are making it hard to plan as local officials decide how to best try to salvage economies while emerging from strict stay-at-home orders.

Policies vary widely in some states, a hodgepodge of rules from one beach town to the next. In others, the states have rules in place that impede summer visitors.

In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Scarborough and East Matunuck beaches would be the first to welcome beachgoers. But there will be restrictions. The number of parking spaces will be significantly reduced, bathrooms and concession stands will be closed, and there will be no lifeguards.

In Middletown, Rhode Island, the town administrator said details on how to handle summer beach visitors were still being worked out. ""Each beach is different, and the town council needs to decide what's best for Middletown,"" Shawn Brown said in an email.

Tourism-related businesses have been stymied by a policy of requiring out-of-staters to self-quarantine for 14 days.

“I’m hoping it’s the first week of June that the quarantine is lifted, but by July 1 at the latest,” said Walter Andrews, general manager of the Newport Marriott, the largest hotel in Newport, Rhode Island. “It’s crucial we have a date. I can’t make a move without direction from the state.”

New York state beaches will reopen the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. In announcing the reopening, the state joins New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut.

But expect to find new rules at any beach. Those flocking to Cocoa Beach, Florida, must not gather in groups of more than five and must stay at least 6 feet from other groups. Violators face potential $500 fines. Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina has limited groups to 10 and doesn't allow sunbathing or just sitting – only ""non-stationary exercise activities"" like walking, jogging, swimming and surfing/water sports.

As summer nears, the restrictions could ease and the crowds will follow, beach town locals predict.

""People are tired of being cooped up in the house, and once the governor gives that OK, it's going to get crowded again,"" said Devon Byrd, who lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

But if COVID-19 cases start to increase, the rules – and perhaps new ones – could be reimposed. Against that backdrop of uncertainty, families are having to lay bets about whether try to attempt their usual vacations.

Scott Kessler of Stuarts Draft, Virginia, and his family typically visit Virginia Beach several times a year. They stay at the Best Western Sandcastle on 13th Street. They always eat at Captain George’s Seafood Restaurant. They schedule their trips for August or September so they can attend an Old Dominion University football game.

This year, the plan was to go Sept. 4 to watch Old Dominion University play Wake Forest University, and then make a weekend of it by getting in some beach time. Facing COVID-19, Kessler is uncertain if that will happen.

“We're likely going to wait to see what happens to the virus before we make any concrete plans,” Kessler said.

He’s hoping conditions are better later in the summer. Even if he can go, he knows it won't be the same.

Kessler said they probably won’t eat at Captain George’s. They’ll still likely take a swim in the ocean, but do so while practicing social distancing.

Going to a crowded football game is a concern, but if the family goes, Kessler said they’ll wear face masks.

Amie Michael of Mount Sidney, Virginia, usually goes with her family to Virginia Beach shortly after school is out for the year. She’s a teacher and with one child still in high school and another in college, it’s an end-of-school-year celebration. They're waiting to see what happens.

“It has been booked for months,” she said. “We are still hoping to go but will cancel if the beach doesn't open.”

If they do go, dining and activities around towns could be challenges. Even though popular Rehoboth Beach in Delaware's boardwalk and beach have reopened, bars and restaurants are still takeout only. Short-term rentals and hotels are also not yet back.

Merchants, whose fortunes depend on strong summer business, are hoping for the best. They know this will be a summer like no other – both in terms of how many customers to expect and the precautions they will need to take to keep them safe.

""I think it could be a healthy mix of apprehension and excitement,"" said Karen Sphar, executive vice president of the Southport Oak Island Area Chamber of Commerce in North Carolina. ""If you are a business owner, you are extremely excited and ready to go. You may have been limping along a little bit, but now you are looking forward to getting business back into your establishment.""

Vacationers may want to isolate themselves in beach shacks or seaside apartments that they can treat as their own homes with less worry about the coronavirus left behind by past guests. They will be encouraged to shun crowds.

""People want to get away and have a safe vacation,"" said Isaac Baker, marketing director for Treasure Realty in Topsail Beach, North Carolina. ""There's no better place to be than in the sunshine on the beach.""

1259,1492,https://www.politico.eu/article/europeans-losing-patience-with-governments-coronavirus-covid19/,2020-05-19,Polls show Europeans losing patience with governments,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

The device will also be used to track the recovery of patients from their homes and hospital beds.

“It’s like a wireless stethoscope glued to your neck,” John A. Rogers, a Northwestern University professor of biomedical engineering who partners with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.

The device monitors breathing, coughing, temperature and heart rate — data that is uploaded and made available to doctors every night when the wearer puts it on a charging dock.

Though originally designed to help monitor the recovery of stroke patients, researchers realized it could be used to measure the vibratory signatures of coronavirus symptoms.

The devices are being worn by about 10 doctors and nurses working in Chicago. They’re also on about 20 patients who are recovering at home and in hospital beds. Rogers expects that number to soon grow.

Rogers and his team can produce about 100 of the devices a week. If demand outpaces their ability to make the devices, Rogers said he’d find a manufacturer who could handle higher quantities.",real

Durbin hits the ‘frontline’ of the county’s battle against COVID-19,"Sen. Dick Durbin visited Stroger Hospital Friday morning, calling the hospital the “frontline of a battle against COVID-19” ahead of a potential vote on a bill that could provide another round of funding for testing.

The battle against the deadly coronavirus should include more money for testing, Durbin said, standing outside of tents that serve as walk-up and drive-thru testing sites for county health patients and employees on the hospital grounds.

“The good news is that there’s $483 million coming into the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago from that federal appropriation that was announced last night with the Centers for Disease Control,” the Springfield Democrat said.

“That is money that will be used for testing — we absolutely, positively need to have even more. A new bill before Congress that may be voted on today could provide another $75 billion for testing, and when the president stands up and says ‘we have prevailed over COVID-19,’ he is just flat out wrong. ... This is still a battle that we have to win.”

Half of the 250 patients at the county’s marquee hospital have COVID-19, Debra Carey, Cook County Health’s interim CEO, said. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said caring for those who seek the county’s help, sometimes without a means to pay for the care they receive, has proved a “tremendous challenge” for the health care system.

“This health and hospital system has served our county for 180 years. It’s always taken in anyone who comes through our doors regardless of their race or gender, sexual orientation, immigration status or ability to pay,” Preckwinkle said. “And this challenge, this pandemic challenge, just reflects the incredible health inequities that we see in our county and our country ... This is not a red state or a blue state issue, local government all across the country are hurting.”

The county is already facing a $200 million revenue shortfall because of the pandemic’s effect on the economy, and yesterday the county reached a grim milestone, surpassing Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases Thursday, based on a Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.

As of Thursday, there were 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Durbin said more federal help would be needed to help lower the coronavirus case load.

“If we are going to fight this successfully, spare people suffering and death, if we’re going to reopen this economy, we can’t announce we have prevailed,” Durbin said. “We have not prevailed, [the] battle still continues, but testing is critical to prevailing, this $483 million to our state will help. We need more.”",real
1270,112,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186634/bill-de-blasio-elon-musk-ventilator-shortage-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19,2020-03-19,NYC mayor asks Elon Musk to manufacture ventilators for COVID-19 patients,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday night that he’s willing to have his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, make crucial ventilators to help patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to take him up on that offer.

De Blasio tweeted at Musk on Thursday morning, saying New York City “will need thousands [of ventilators] over the next few weeks,” despite already acquiring them “as fast as we can.” The mayor said his team would reach out to Musk directly. “We could use your help!” he wrote. (After this article was published, Musk responded: “Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs.)

“We could use your help!”

Musk had tweeted that he’d have his teams make ventilators “if there’s a shortage,” and by all accounts, there will be. The only reason it might not seem like there isn’t one currently in the US is that we haven’t yet exhausted the short supply. And while President Trump said he’s willing to invoke the wartime “Defense Production Act” on Wednesday to address the shortage, he tweeted later in the day that he’d only do so in a “worst case scenario.”

@elonmusk New York City is buying!



Our country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP — we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks. We’re getting them as fast as we can but we could use your help!



We’re reaching out to you directly. — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 19, 2020

Musk isn’t the first to propose using his company’s manufacturing facilities to make critical equipment. Just yesterday, General Motors said CEO Mary Barra told the White House she was looking into making ventilators at her company’s factories. Ford followed suit soon after. Musk is alone among those peers in underplaying the pandemic, though. He called the “panic” over the coronavirus “dumb,” compared the lethality of COVID-19 to car crashes (which are not contagious), and finished his Twitter conversation about ventilators on Wednesday night by again saying he thinks the “panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.”

As for how Musk might approach making ventilators, the entrepreneur said they are “not difficult” to make. He pointed to how Tesla makes “cars with sophisticated hvac systems,” and SpaceX “makes spacecraft with life support systems,” though he admitted it would take some time to spin up any real production effort. Where they would be built is another question; Tesla is currently locked in a back-and-forth with local authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area over whether the company should suspend production of electric cars amid a shelter-in-place order, and it could run into a similar issue at its Gigafactory in Nevada now that the state has issued a similar directive.

President Trump’s gutting of critical government offices, combined with his apparent refusal to take the threat of the novel coronavirus seriously in the early weeks, has left states and local governments overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. At the same time, Trump’s administration has leaned hard on the private sector to pick up the slack in ways that have repeatedly surprised those companies. He claimed Google was developing a nationwide screening website that will help people learn if and how they should get tested for COVID-19 and said retail companies would offer up parking lot space for testing sites — despite neither of those claims having been completely true before they were uttered aloud.

Still, companies are putting themselves into the mix. Amazon announced it will hire 100,000 workers worldwide and is bumping up its hourly pay to both help with a delivery crunch and provide jobs for people who are now out of work. Gaming company Razer has said it will help make masks, too.

Musk is no stranger to inserting himself into an international crisis. He famously spun up an effort at SpaceX in 2018 to create a submersible vessel to help rescue the soccer team trapped in a cave network in Thailand. If Musk really wants to help out this time around, it looks like he already has one taker in New York City. It almost certainly won’t be the last, either.

(TMU) – For much of the world, it’s been weeks if not months since we entered lockdown. And while humanity hitting the “pause” button has seemingly been a blessing in disguise for some creatures who have used the respite to enjoy clean air and water for the first time in decades, other animals actually may miss us human beings.

Such appears to be the case for the dolphins who hang out at Tin Can Bay in Queensland, Australia, where the sea mammals have been lining up to bring gifts ashore – “apparently because they’re missing interaction with humans,” according to a report by 7News.

Barnacles Café and Dolphin feeding is typically filled with tourists throughout the year, and offers visitors the priceless opportunity to interact with wild humpback dolphins. And the wild dolphins do enjoy the opportunity to be treated to fresh fish by happy visitors.

But Australia began imposing strict quarantine rules in the middle of March, visitors stopped lining up to feed the animals – and the humpbacks may be worried about the sudden disappearance of their land-loving bipedal friends.

According to Barnacles, the local dolphin pod has been presenting gifts to staff at the café, ranging from barnacle-encrusted bottles to sea sponges and fragments of coral.

A post on the cafe’s Facebook page read:

“The pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they’re missing the public interaction and attention. They are definitely missing you all.”

The pod has been bringing us regular gifts, showing us how much they’re missing the public interaction and attention☹️… Posted by Barnacles Cafe & Dolphin Feeding on Monday, May 18, 2020

A volunteer at the café told reporters from ABC that while the pod has displayed this behavior in the past, the gestures have been increasing since the venue shut down.

For dolphin expert and University of Queensland PhD student Barry McGovern, the explanation for the dolphins’ behavior could be far more mundane.

“Nothing surprises me with dolphins and their behavior anymore. They do everything – they use tools, they have culture, they have something similar to names in signature whistles.”

In general, dolphins are one of the most intelligent animal species on the planet. From their playful nature to their sociability and friendliness toward humans, as well as their legendary interactions with seafarers, dolphins have inspired the adoration of humans since time immemorial.

Increasingly, human researchers are discovering that dolphins display skills and sophistication previously attributed only to the human species, including strong problem solving capabilities and a complex system of communication.

However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that we should project our own feelings of longing borne of the quarantine onto ocean mammals. McGovern explained:

“In all likelihood, they probably don’t miss humans per se … They probably miss a free meal and the routine.”

Dolphins are also generally prone to “play-like behavior.” McGovern said:

“They often play with bits of weed and coral and all sorts of things and just leave it on their rostrum (nose).They’re used to getting fed now, so they’re used to humans coming in. When it’s not happening, maybe it’s just out of boredom.”

Since coronavirus restrictions are being phased out, Barnacles Café has reopened and they have resumed dolphin feeding activities.",fake

CEO Aziz Hasan writes that the crowdfunding company has already seen a significant drop in crowdfunding projects being listed on the site, which is how Kickstarter makes its money. Projects are down by about 35 percent, the memo states, with “no clear sign of rebound.”

Conversations are now starting with Kickstarter’s union organizers about “potential layoffs.” Sixty percent of Kickstarter’s 140 employees are unit members, and they successfully voted to unionize in February this year, making them the first major technology company to do so.

“We must look more broadly at ways to restructure the business, including potential layoffs across teams and at all levels of staff.”

Hasan writes that the company brought in $1.27 million in after-tax profit last year, and that money has already been reinvested back into the business. He’s now looking for more “significant cost-cutting,” including reducing senior leaders’ salaries, including his own, not automatically back hiring open roles, and cutting the budget “wherever we can.” Still, layoffs are likely imminent.

“We must look more broadly at ways to restructure the business, including potential layoffs across teams and at all levels of staff,” the memo states. Hasan says Kickstarter is in talks with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), which represents Kickstarter’s union. The OPEIU says it has begun discussions with Kickstarter management, but it’s still too early in the process to comment further.

Kickstarter has tried to encourage creators to keep posting projects during the pandemic. It launched a program that solicits small-scale projects that they can work on from home. At the same time, it started moderating COVID-19 projects to weed out any that pushed misinformation or phony solutions, while still promoting other projects that use the pandemic for good, like social-distancing achievement stickers.

1313,1018,https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/5/15/21260692/face-masks-covering-springfield-downstate-republican-darren-bailey-halbrook-covid-19-coronavirus,2020-05-15,Face off on masks looming in Springfield? Two downstate Republicans balk at COVID-19 precautions,"SPRINGFIELD — With the pandemic now nearing its fourth month in Illinois, most residents have made up their minds on whether to wear masks or other face coverings, but two downstate Republicans say they need a few days to think it over.

“It boils down, in my book, to a matter of personal choice,” said state Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville.

That declaration of personal choice could soon be put to the test.

That’s because next week the Illinois Legislature is scheduled to return to session for the first time since March 5, but that return is not without some changes. Notably, the Illinois House will meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, and legislators will be asked to wear face masks, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and adhere to social distancing measures.

Mulling an about-face, Halbrook and fellow Republican state Rep. Darren Bailey of downstate Xenia said they won’t commit to wearing masks when the House meets on Wednesday, potentially creating a standoff between them and Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan.

Public health officials, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommend people wear cloth face coverings in “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” not only to prevent themselves from getting sick but also to prevent someone from unknowingly contracting the virus and spreading it to others.

And on Friday, Republican House Leader Jim Durkin urged GOP legislators to abide by those rules.

But Bailey, who is suing Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the Chicago Democrat’s stay-at-home order, said he’s not concerned about contracting COVID-19 and that House members who are should stay away from Springfield next week.

“So, if you are concerned about your health then, by all means, you should stay home or you wear a mask,” Bailey said. “If someone doesn’t want to wear a mask, then they’re simply taking the risk themselves.”

Halbrook said he is concerned that wearing a face covering could have negative health consequences for him. While Halbrook did not say whether he had an underlying health condition that could prevent him from wearing a mask, he said he wants to meet with his primary care doctor before he makes that decision.

“I need to understand one-on-one with a professional what the dangers are, what is the upside, what’s the downside,” Halbrook said. “I just want to have that conversation, and I have not been able to get to that person to have that conversation. I’m just trying to make a well-informed decision.”

For weeks, Republicans called for the General Assembly return, but it was only after Pritzker joined that chorus that fellow Democrats Madigan and Senate President Don Harmon agreed.

In a letter to Durkin announcing the return to Springfield, Madigan wrote that he was asking House members to follow “approved precautions” from the Illinois Department of Public Health, which included wearing a face mask.

With Bailey and Halbrook as potential holdouts, Durkin sent a letter his GOP caucus on Friday asking members to “abide by best practices and safety protocols put forth by the Illinois Department of Public Health, which include temperature checks and wearing a protective mask.”

“We have a duty to not only uphold the Constitution but to also protect the health and well-being of our citizens and that includes our staff, House personnel, our colleagues, their families and members of the public,” the Western Springs Republican wrote.

Bailey and Halbrook are the first two Republicans to object.

In response, state Rep. Emanuel “Chris” Welch, D-Hillside, took to Twitter to call for the downstate Republicans and any other House members who refuse to wear face coverings to be “banned from entering the convention center.”

“Your intentional, reckless act to ignore the face mask guidance will risk lives. I’m aware of members in our caucus and your caucus with newborns at home,” Welch tweeted.

Whether any bare-faced legislators will be barred from the Bank of Springfield Center remains to be seen.

Madigan spokesman Steve Brown wouldn’t say whether the guidelines spelled out by the Southwest Side Democrat will be enforced, only that “we remain very hopeful that all members respect their colleagues and staff.”",real

The Los Angeles district attorney's office acknowledged Tuesday that convicted sex offender Weinstein will not be extradited anytime soon to face more sex-crime charges in California due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""The virus has delayed the processing of the extradition paperwork,"" said Greg Risling, spokesman for District Attorney Jackie Lacey, in an email to USA TODAY. ""There is no time estimate on when he will appear in a Los Angeles courtroom.""

His statement reiterates what the L.A. district attorney's office has been saying since former Hollywood mogul Weinstein, 68, was convicted of two sex crimes in Manhattan in February and sentenced in March to 23 years in a New York state prison.

Although Lacey stated publicly she had begun the extradition process, she was vague about when it could be accomplished as the coronavirus spread throughout the country and especially in crowded jails and prisons.

The unlikelihood of immediate extradition became more obvious after Weinstein tested positive for COVID-19 and was placed in isolation in an upstate New York prison where he is serving his sentence for first-degree sexual assault and third-degree rape.

Weinstein's spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, declined to comment on his medical status, and prison officials can't comment on inmates' medical records. But Weinstein, who has various medical problems and was hospitalized twice immediately after his conviction, is believed to have recovered while incarcerated in a medical unit.

In April, Lacey announced she had charged Weinstein with another sex crime in Los Angeles County, adding to the four charges already pending against him. The new charge is a felony count of sexual battery by restraint stemming from an encounter with a woman at a Beverly Hills hotel in May 2010.

The first four charges, including rape and sexual assault stemming from two encounters in local hotels in February 2013, were announced by Lacey on the opening day in January of Weinstein's Manhattan trial.

""At this time, it is unknown when Weinstein will be transferred to Los Angeles County,"" Lacey said in a statement in April when she announced the new charge. ""Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified.""",real

But they now face massive budget deficits.

Without immediate federal aid, states will start be forced to slash their budgets, laying off workers en masse, cutting funds for education and healthcare, and more.

Michael Leachman is Senior Director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

A week ago, President Trump, Democratic leaders in Congress, and the National Governors Association's bipartisan leaders all expressed support for Washington providing fiscal relief for cash-strapped states in the next stimulus measure.

They recognized that, due to what's becoming the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, states are facing budget shortfalls of unprecedented size and — without relief — they'll start laying off first responders, teachers, and health care workers and cutting spending in other ways that will deepen the recession.

Now, however, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other Senate Republicans are suggesting that the state budget crisis reflects the fiscal irresponsibility of Democrat-run states and arguing that Washington shouldn't bail them out because that would only reward their profligacy.

But, as John Adams said, facts are stubborn things. And the fact is that states face a budget crisis not because they've mismanaged their finances. It's because all over America, in states led by Republicans as well as Democrats, businesses have closed and millions have lost their jobs, and, as a result, state tax revenues have dried up at a record pace. States get 70% of their tax revenues from sales and income taxes, and both are collapsing because places where people shop are closed and the millions who are now laid off aren't paying income taxes.

To prevent states from making deep budget cuts and imposing massive layoffs that would make the economic crisis even worse, the federal government must provide significant fiscal relief as soon as possible and ensure that it remains in place until the economy recovers.

States are facing a massive budget crisis

Unlike the federal government, almost all states must balance their budgets each year. As their current fiscal years draw to a close on June 30, their shrinking revenues are creating huge shortfalls that they must fill this spring as well as projections of more enormous shortfalls for the coming years.

At the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we project states will have a combined $650 billion in shortfalls from fiscal years 2020 through 2022. Many local governments will face shortfalls on top of that.

Without significant relief from the federal government, states will have to take drastic action to balance their budgets, such as slashing education and healthcare, laying off teachers and other workers, and canceling contracts with businesses. That would take money out of the economy at just the wrong time, making the recession deeper, delaying the recovery, and hurting millions of families.

States were in good shape before the pandemic

Far from mismanaging their finances of late, states did a reasonable job in recent years of preparing for a recession, with ""rainy day"" funds of about 7.5% of state budgets, which was higher than before the last recession. Their total reserves, which include the year-end balances in their general funds, were also higher.

Also in better shape were the state trust funds that support unemployment insurance programs. The problem is that nobody could have predicted that a global pandemic would send the economy into such a steep nosedive and eviscerate state finances so quickly.

States have hardly been overspending of late. State general fund spending for current operations — basic functions like schools, healthcare, the justice system, and public health — is significantly lower as a share of the economy than before the last recession. Frankly, states have spent too little in some key areas, shortchanging investments needed for future economic growth.

For instance, states have fewer teachers and other school workers than a decade ago, even though they now have many more students. State funding for higher education per pupil is down an average of 13% from about a decade ago in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing colleges to raise tuition and putting college out of reach for more families. And, as a share of the economy, states are spending far less on infrastructure than decades ago, shortchanging another key tool for economic growth.

Funding for critical services

McConnell's suggestion that states would use fiscal relief to bail out their pension systems is badly off-base. For starters, they would put fiscal relief dollars into their general funds, not the separate trust funds that cover pensions.

While states and localities make payments into the pension funds to help cover future obligations, these payments comprise an overage of just 4.7% of state and local general fund spending.

Rather than help the states, McConnell has said that Washington should let them go bankrupt. That would do nothing to help the economy now, however, and it would hurt the states in the coming years.

Bankruptcy lets individuals and businesses ease their debt and cancel their obligations, but state debt isn't high by historical standards and states should be able to meet those obligations when the economy recovers. Since the late 1800s, only one state (Arkansas in 1934) has ever defaulted on its general obligation debt.

Letting states declare bankruptcy could significantly raise their borrowing costs for major transportation and other projects because investors, who would worry about getting repaid, would demand higher interest payments.

Rather than turn an unprecedented state budget crisis into just one more partisan brawl in Washington, the White House and Senate Republican leaders should support the desperately needed fiscal relief that will protect the jobs of many thousands of workers, ease the deep economic downturn, and soften its blow for millions of families.

US retail spending declined by a record amount in April for the second straight month. The contraction comes as the widespread coronavirus lockdown freezes economic activity and consumer spending.

Retail sales plunged 16.4% in April, according to a Friday report from the Commerce Department. The decline was more stark than economists expected. The median estimate compiled by Bloomberg was for a 12% drop.

The April data shows a fuller extent of government shutdowns designed to contain the coronavirus, compared to the partial impact seen in March. Consumers slowed their spending even further as job losses persisted, sending the unemployment rate to highs not seen since the Great Depression.

Spending decreased in all but one major category: nonstore retailers. The group, which includes Amazon, saw an 8.4% jump for the month. On the flip side, a 78.8% drop at clothing stores led declines, following by a 60.6% decline in electronics and appliances stores.

Food and beverages stores fell 13.1% in April, following a 25.6% jump in March as consumer stocked up. Food services and drinking places also slumped 29.5% during the month.

The plunge has invigorated fears that US gross domestic product will experience a sharp drop in the second quarter. Retail sales account for more than 40% of consumer spending, which in turn is around 70% of US GDP.

""The 23% cumulative fall in retail sales over the last two months this alone is enough to knock more than 6 percentage points off the level of nominal GDP,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, in a Friday note.

Researchers from the University of Lethbridge said a study in April, printed in the online journal Preprints, showed that at least thirteen cannabis plants were high in CBD, which appeared to affect the ACE2 pathways that the virus uses to access the body. Olga Kovalchuk, one of the researchers, said:

“We were totally stunned at first, and then we were really happy.”

The results indicated hemp extracts high in CBD might help block proteins that provide a “gateway” for COVID-19 to enter host cells.

RELATED STORY:

Kovalchuk’s husband, Igor, suggested that cannabis could reduce the virus’s entry points by up to 70 percent, adding:

“Therefore, you have more chance to fight it. Our work could have a huge influence — there aren’t many drugs that have the potential of reducing infection by 70 to 80 percent.”

The researchers emphasized that more research was needed. Still, they said the study gave hope that cannabis, if proven to modulate the enzyme, “may prove a plausible strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility” as well as “become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy.”

RELATED STORY:

The study suggested that cannabis could even be used to “develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products,” with a “potential to decrease viral entry” through the mouth.

Olga said that study suggested that just a handful of more than 800 varities of sativa appeared to help. All were high in anti-inflammatory CBD — but low in THC, the part that produces the cannabis high. She added:

“The key thing is not that any cannabis you would pick up at the store will do the trick.”

RELATED STORY:

The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, was carried out in partnership with Pathway Rx, a cannabis therapy research company, and Swysh Inc., a cannabinoid-based research company.

The researchers are exploring funding to continue their efforts to support scientific initiatives to address COVID-19. The research stated:

“While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is crucial for the future analysis of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19.” “Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered.”

""The phenomenon of Granny working in McDonald's really started to ramp up,"" said Ghilarducci, who leads the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School in New York.

Yet, as bad as it was then, she sees the current Covid-19 recession making life even more uncertain and even more difficult for those in their 50s, 60s and 70s. By her calculations, the pandemic will force another 3.1 million older workers into poverty in their retirement, with many forced to choose between their health and their need for a paycheck.

CNBC spoke with Ghilarducci about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable to this recession, and what the pandemic's fallout has revealed to us about the risks of our current retirement system.

The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

CNBC: How do you see this recession impacting older workers and retirement differently than previous recessions?

Teresa Ghilarducci: The unemployment rate. It's going up among older workers faster than any other group, except for the very young. They probably won't get back into the labor force, or it'll take them a long time to get another job. That means they'll draw down on their retirement savings, they may go into debt and they'll also apply for Social Security earlier, forgoing increased benefits. As a result, people who are middle-class workers now will be poor or near-poor retirees for the rest of their lives.

CNBC: Why are so many older Americans being thrown out of work during the pandemic?

TG: It has to do with the jobs they were in. Education and health care, health care that wasn't involved with Covid care: dentist offices, optometrist offices, home health care, these are jobs that were all lost in the last couple of months and were disproportionately filled by older workers, and older women, by the way. Women have been harder hit than men in the Covid recession, and older women especially.

CNBC: Why is it harder for older workers who've lost their jobs to get re-hired than it is for younger workers? And how could the pandemic exacerbate the problem?

TG: There's the sense that older workers don't have the skills or potential that younger workers have and, in most cases, that's an irrational, discriminatory prejudice. But in this recession, caused by the pandemic, there may be a rational basis for the age discrimination. Older workers coming back to work may face much worse health hazards, and they will need special accommodations by their employers. The employer of an older worker may be concerned about their health and the liability associated with not providing a safe working place.",real

On Thursday, the UK government tasked civil servants with developing a new plan, codenamed Project Defend, to be less dependent on China.

The project will be led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and consists of two separate groups of officials that have been tasked with ensuring that the UK will not be reliant on one single country for the import of strategic goods.

London’s desire to exert control over supply lines comes in the wake of a joint EU recovery proposal published by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.

The two leaders called for greater EU sovereignty over the production of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. They proposed establishing a so-called Recovery Fund, which would provide 500 billion euros ($550 billion) in EU budget spending to support the sectors and regions that were hit hardest. The bloc is yet to reach a consensus on how to fund the economy reboot.

Almost half of the global cases of COVID-19 have been reported on the European continent, as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control announced that 1,773,658 cases of the disease, as well as 166,580 deaths have been reported in the EU, countries of the European Economic Area and the UK.

Reindustralisation of Europe

Last month, the French government ordered more than 2 billion masks from China, as the pandemic situation was becoming direr. Paris also pledged to ramp up its own production of personal protective items due to the acute shortage.

The hardest-hit EU countries have denounced the dependence on other countries as the reason for the initial difficulties of combating the coronavirus internally.

""I fear that we are witnessing a lot of political gesticulation, about ‘re-industrializing Europe’ during this crisis. It is obvious that governments must ask themselves questions of security and public health for essential supplies. It is also true that the liberal policy of globalization has caused Europe to de-industrialize to the benefit of emerging countries which have since become economic giants or the workshop of the world, such as China,"" Michel Liegeois, a professor at the Belgium’s University of Louvain, told Sputnik.

According to Liegeois, the European Union could potentially introduce tariffs on imports from China, but that would lead to immediate retaliatory measures by China.

""I think it is difficult to go beyond the re-creation of strategic stocks, for facial masks for example, and possibly an industrial relocation for the same strategic supplies. A commercial renegotiation with China, if possible, would be very difficult and would require changes to the competition rules,"" the professor noted.

According to Matteo Volpe, sales director for DomusLift – IGV Group, a large producer of lifts in Italy, ""the EU and the national governments have led a policy of laissez-faire, which has resulted in endemic unemployment of low-qualified workers in Europe, since most of the production has been sent to Asia, to reduce costs. Overproduction of the workers has increased labor costs that have pushed companies to delocalize to China.""

Reindustrialisation initiatives, similar to the UK’s Project Defend, will certainly be taken to the parliamentary debates, while proposals made by the Left and Right parties in many European countries would not be immediately qualified as strategic.

What Economists Have to Say

Commenting on repatriating industries and reindustrialisation in Europe, French economist Charles Gave told Sputnik that gaining independence from China would carry a high cost.

""A return to self-sufficiency in Europe would have a cost. Some might try to repatriate pharmaceutical production from India or China, but the costs in Europe are much higher: wages, taxes, social security, binding standards. Even for a very robotized factory, this is not easy. If there is a relocation from China, the manufacturer will prefer to set up the new factory in Vietnam or Ukraine, for example. It is not a zero-sum game,"" Gave said.

According to the economist, keeping industries in China is more profitable as labor costs, environmental requirements and lower security standards are less demanding than those in the EU.

""And paradoxically, the departure of China could increase the globalization of the economy; by dispersing production units elsewhere, from Asia to North Africa. In addition, China could outsource the factories it controls from home to other countries: China could set up a factory in Thailand, or Portugal for example,"" Gave suggested.

Though the test was only authorized for emergency use, this marks the first time the FDA has allowed a CRISPR-based tool to be used in patients. CRISPR technology can quickly find and link onto any genetic sequence in a specimen. The new test, created by the biotech company Sherlock Biosciences, uses one molecule to search for the virus gene in a patient sample. Then, if the molecule finds the gene, it releases a signal that the system can detect.

The standard method for COVID-19 testing, called PCR, also looks for tiny bits of the virus gene. However, that method is slow and takes specialized equipment to run. The recently approved Abbott test gives results in minutes but can only run on that company’s platform. CRISPR-based techniques, on the other hand, are relatively fast and only need basic equipment found in most labs.

Experts say that the United States needs to run hundreds of thousands more tests each day to control the pandemic. Rapid, simple tests could help reach that scale.

Sherlock Biosciences said in a press release that it is working to produce and distribute testing kits. Two other groups, at Mammoth Biosciences and MIT, are also working on CRISPR-based tests.",real

Several other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have imposed new restrictions recently as cases have increased dramatically following the easing of constraints during the holy month.

Qatar’s announcement followed a cabinet meeting Monday. Starting May 22, all citizens and residents leaving their homes must download the Ehteraz tracking app on their phones so that those coming into contact with someone who tests positive can be tracked. Face masks are also mandatory in Qatar, and violators face jail time and fines of up to $53,000.

Qatar has reported 34,000 cases of the virus (more than 1 percent of the population), with 1,365 new ones just on Monday.

The UAE also announced late Monday that the night curfew would begin at 8 p.m. instead of 10 p.m., “in light of what we have observed during the holy month of Ramadan and the increase in the number of covid-19 infections resulting from some of the individuals in the community who were reckless and didn’t take into account the precautionary measures,” said Saif Juma al-Dhaheri of the Safety and Prevention Department.

Cases in the UAE have topped 24,000, more than twice the number before Ramadan began late last month. Dhaheri warned against family gatherings that could further spread the virus. The fasting period will end this weekend with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which is normally celebrated with days of family visits and communal dinners.

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also experienced major jumps in the new numbers of cases over the weeks of Ramadan, and both have reimposed restrictions.

Starting on Eid al-Fitr, Saudi Arabia, the worst-hit country in the region after Iran, will return to a 24-hour lockdown. The kingdom reported 2,593 new cases Monday, for a total of more than 57,000.

In contrast, prayers at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem will resume following the end of Ramadan festivities, as the virus’s spread there has slowed, the Council of the Islamic Waqf, the religious body that controls the site, said Tuesday.",real

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

House Democrats are moving full steam ahead with legislation to provide a new wave of coronavirus relief at a price tag of more than $3 trillion, with plans to call the full House back on Friday to approve it.

Democrats are moving forward without Republican support since bipartisan talks have stalled, and the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival for the GOP-led Senate. But Democrats say the plan, dubbed the Heroes Act, details the priorities they believe need to be addressed as the economic and public health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic worsen.

The more than 1,800-page bill marks a long wish list for Democrats, including nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments and another round of direct cash payments to Americans. It extends unemployment benefits to January, adds hazard pay for front-line workers and expands virus-testing efforts.

""We must think big for the people now, because if we don't, it will cost more in lives and livelihood later,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday. ""Not acting is the most expensive course. We are presenting a plan to do what is necessary to deal with the [coronavirus] crisis and make sure we can get the country back to work and school safely.""

Democrats are viewing the legislation as a critical marker of what they see as gaps left by the previous roughly $3 trillion in spending that has already been enacted in the last two months. Bipartisan talks to reach a deal on a fifth relief bill haven't gotten off the ground as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it's time first to evaluate how the previous packages are working. He is also insisting that any new bill include liability protections for businesses and individuals, a move Democrats oppose.

The chamber's leaders were also quick to slam the Democrats' plan on Tuesday.

""This is nothing more than a messaging exercise from House Democrats,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. ""It is an effort to try and create talking points for the 2020 election. It's not going anywhere, and we know that.""

Among its provisions, the Democratic proposal provides $200 billion to essential workers in pandemic hazard pay. It also adds another $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment efforts.

Many Democrats, including House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., say the coronavirus crisis has exposed significant systemic shortcomings in the way the federal government supports workers and families.

""The coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net,"" Clark said in an interview. ""It has brought into stark relief issues that we knew were there but now we can see their devastating impacts so clearly.""

Clark is advocating for new child care funding and programs to make it easier for families, and women in particular, to return to work as schools and child care facilities remain closed. Democrats say it will be difficult to restart the economy without some intervention to keep businesses afloat and to allow workers to return safely to their jobs.

Some moderate Democrats are wary about approving another large spending bill but have been largely willing to support the additional spending as long as it is closely tailored to the coronavirus response, according to aides familiar with the talks. Most Democrats are referring to the legislation as a follow-up to the CARES Act, which was approved in March, but it is not seen as the final action that Congress will have to take in response to the coronavirus.

The new legislative proposal, released Tuesday, provides large sums for some of Democrats' top priorities, including $500 billion in direct, flexible aid for state governments and an additional $357 billion for local governments and counties. Many Senate Republicans have criticized the push for more state aid, arguing that any new money needs to be tied to the pandemic and not help address budget issues that predated the crisis.

Democrats set aside $3.6 billion to protect federal elections, $25 billion to support the U.S. Postal Service, $100 billion for low-income rent support, $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund and $100 million for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs.

The bill includes some changes to programs that were approved in the CARES Act, including an expansion of the IRS payment program. Democrats want more generous benefits for families, including a $1,200 payment for each dependent. The CARES Act limits payments to $500 per child; adults or other dependents do not currently qualify. The bill provides up to $6,000 per household.

It also expands funding for small-business loans, enhances an employee-retention tax credit program and boosts worker protections.

Republicans have already rejected many elements of the bill, including a suspension of the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was approved as part of the 2017 GOP-led tax cuts.

Democrats also want to extend emergency family and medical leave until the end of 2021. Doing so is part of their broader focus on child care and family support. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the earlier version of the leave provisions, which passed in March and extend through the end of this year, would themselves cost $105 billion. The latest proposal would more than double the length of those benefits.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., on Tuesday highlighted the funding for safe elections.

The plan ""is a further response to this unprecedented challenge to our people, to our health and to our economic well-being,"" Hoyer said.

The House is also planning to vote separately on Friday on a Democratic plan that would allow some members to vote by proxy when they are unable to return to the Capitol because of the health crisis. The proposal also sets up procedures for lawmakers to participate in hearings remotely.

The House Rules Committee is slated to take up the funding bill, as well as the remote voting and hearings bill, on Thursday to ready the measures for Friday's floor action.",real

It’s impossible for the half a million motorists driving by the cemetery everyday on the 405 freeway – the nation’s busiest – not to be moved by the sight of 90,000 small flags rippling in the wind, commemorating the men and women service members buried there.

It’s an awesome sight. But, this year there will be no flags, no Boy or Girl Scouts kneeling at every gravesite and standing to salute them – no visual, emotional impact to make motorists driving by on the 405 snap out of their freeway trance, and feel a surge of national pride.

The coronavirus has seen to that, too.

“We can’t have a public celebration on Monday, either,” says Thomas Ruck, director of the national cemetery. “The National Cemetery Administration says we must follow the guidelines of the city we’re in, and Los Angeles has no gatherings of more than six people.”

Channel 7 is broadcasting a live ceremony Monday at 10 a.m. of speakers and patriotic singers on different stages socially distanced throughout the cemetery, but there will be no audience, no crowd to cheer.

Just TV cameras standing in for us.

Even if there was a way around it, Ruck says Boy Scout organizers have told him there normally would be 5,000 to 6,000 scouts signed up by now for the flag placement program on Saturday, but so far there’s less than 1,000 because parents are rightfully concerned.

They’d rather be safe than sorry, he says. Totally understandable. No one wants to put their kids in harms way.

“It is definitely disappointing to all of us in the scouting community,” says David Goldenberg, Memorial Day flag placement chairperson for the LA County Council of Boys Scouts of America.

“It’s been something like 30 to 40 years we’ve been doing this. It’s the largest yearly event where scouts come together from all the different organizations.

“Sure, people are concerned right now on what to do. Our whole scouting program has changed to being online to keep active and moving forward. If only one person got sick for coming out and participating in this (the flag placement), well…”

He didn’t need to say any more. It would be tragic.

“We’re working on plans now to have our scouts dress in uniform on Monday, go outside their homes at a designated time, salute the flag, and have a moment of silence, so we can do something” says Goldenberg, scoutmaster for troop 22 in Woodland Hills.

What can we, the public do? A person coming into the cemetery is only allowed to place a flag at the gravesite of a loved one, according to cemetery rules. No other graves.

It’s not the only Memorial Day event that’s had to shut down this year. It’s happening all over Southern California, with “virtual” events replacing the real thing.

Grocery store sales of products like Beyond Meat and Tofurky were up 264 percent during a nine-week period ending on May 2nd, according to Nielsen (via The Wall Street Journal). Overall, retail sales plunged 16.4 percent from March to April. The popularity of faux meat exploded starting in March, with sales of fresh meat alternatives surging 206 percent the first week of March and rising 279 percent the week ending on March 14th, according to Nielsen.

Plant-based meat products still lag behind their animal-based counterparts in terms of market size. The 264 percent uptick of faux meat sales represented an increase of $25.7 million, while fresh meat sales — up only 45 percent during the same period — saw a $3.8 billion total increase. That’s despite production of meat products declining 28 percent year over year, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.

The US meat industry has been rocked by the pandemic, with major producers shutting down production and thousands of workers infected with the novel coronavirus in 19 states. At least 20 meat plant workers have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, the CEO of JBS, the largest beef producer in the US, said the impact of the novel coronavirus will be felt across the meat industry for months.",real

A hospital in Tennessee that has been closed for nearly a year received $121,000 in COVID-19 relief money from the people of the US, and that unconstitutionally, while still owing $1.2 million in federal income taxes.

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, something else not authorized in the Constitution, the Rennova-owned Jamestown Regional Medical Center, which has been closed since June 13, 2019, received $121,722 in federal relief money from the unconstitutional coronavirus stimulus passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.

WTSP reports:

As the Rennova-owned hospital cashes taxpayer dollars, WBIR found it owes more than $1.2 million in unpaid federal taxes.

“It’s disgusting in a way,” former Jamestown nurse Karen Cooper said. “There are hospitals and things that are seeing the COVID patients that could’ve utilized that money.”

Cooper is part of a class-action lawsuit alleging Rennova did not pay Social Security or federal payroll taxes withheld from employee’s paychecks.

Rennova appears to be in deep financial trouble at the other two hospitals it runs, the Big South Fork Medical Center in Oneida and the Jellico Community hospital in Campbell County.

It is behind on federal taxes for both locations, with records indicating IRS liens of more than $4.4 million.

Despite the back taxes, Rennova said in financial filings last week the federal government gave it $7.4 million in taxpayer money through the coronavirus relief fund.

Did you get that?

The federal government unconstitutionally gave the corporation owning these hospitals $7.4 million of your money while they owed more than half of that in taxes!

Talk about crony capitalism!

It’s even worse than that.

The corporation also received another $2.3 million in payroll protection loans.

“While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds will meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loans, we cannot assure you that we will not take actions that could cause the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loans, in whole or in part,” Rennova said in a financial filing.

Can you believe that?

More than a week ago, HHS stated that it would “force repayment” of stimulus funds from closed institutions, but the real question is, why were they sent the funds in the first place if the hospital was closed?

Is anyone going to be held responsible, and I’m not necessarily talking about the hospital? I’m talking about the politicians that passed the unlawful legislation and the president that signed it?

Nope, cause everyone is just ok with thugs and thieves taking their money and spending it on things they never authorized them to spend it on.

This is not how you make American great.

It’s just another way that God is judging our country (Deuteronomy 28).

The Motley Fool

The COVID-19 crisis has done extensive damage to the U.S. economy already, and the longer it drags on, the tougher our recovery is apt to be. But as difficult as things have been for individuals, the companies that employ them have been thrust into a very tricky set of circumstances, too.

The good news? Most workers are pleased with the way their employers have handled things in light of COVID-19, according to a recent survey by Workfest powered by Zenefits, an HR software company. Specifically, 67% of employees believe their employers genuinely care about their well-being and have taken steps to make that clear during the pandemic. And 74% think their employers took the right precautions to ensure employee safety during the crisis.

A big part of protecting employees boils down to clear communication, and in this regard, 68% of employees agree that their employers have stepped up. But despite all of this positive news, workers remain concerned about their jobs.

Specifically, 51% of employees surveyed are anxious about their employment status given the state of the economy. And about half of workers think that the companies they work for won't last longer than three months without some type of financial assistance, or without the economy being able to open back up.

If you're worried about losing your job in the course of the ongoing crisis, you're clearly not alone. Here are four steps to take if that's a major concern.

1. Talk to your employer

Your employer may have more financial reserves than you'd expect. Before you spend sleepless nights worrying about a potential layoff, have an honest conversation with your boss. Express that you're concerned about losing your job and ask for a realistic view of where things stand in that regard. Your boss may tell you that your department is last on the chopping block, which could help you breathe easier. Or you may learn that your worries are legitimate, in which case having that knowledge can help you prepare for a layoff accordingly.

2. Assess your savings

Part of the reason so many Americans are struggling financially right now is that they don't have cash reserves in the bank. But if you have a healthy level of emergency savings, you may be in a stronger position to ride out a layoff should that come to be. Look at your savings balance and compare it to what your expenses entail. You may get some peace of mind if you see that you can easily cover three or four months' worth of bills without having to resort to a backup plan.

3. Read up on unemployment benefits

Generally speaking, you're entitled to unemployment benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own. These days, unemployment benefits are more generous than they've been in the past. As part of the COVID-19 relief package that was passed in March, you're now entitled to an extra $600 a week in addition to your regular unemployment benefit. This holds true even if that $600 boost results in a raise. Unemployment has also been extended by 13 weeks, which means you may be entitled to up to 39 weeks of benefits.

4. Figure out what you'll do about health insurance

You may have a decent chunk of cash in emergency savings, and you may be entitled to a respectable unemployment benefit should your job be taken away. But what about health insurance? At a time like this, you can't afford to not have coverage, so spend some time researching your options. You may be able to retain your existing insurance, albeit at a cost. Or your employer may agree to extend your coverage for a while and subsidize your premiums. It's certainly worth having that conversation.

Though it's encouraging to see that most employees think their employers have handled the ongoing crisis well, that doesn't negate the fear of losing their jobs. If you're worried about layoffs, take the above steps. The more information you gather, the more empowered you'll feel at a time when so much uncertainty abounds.

But the 2020 graduate from the University of Illinois at Chicago did so from the backyard of her family’s Berwyn home, not on campus with the momentous ceremony she’d always imagined.

“It was a little bit strange — maybe, in some ways, disappointing,” said Mendez, a first-generation college grad. “Just because I didn’t get to walk across the stage.”

She joined more than 5,000 UIC students — and tens of thousands more at other Illinois schools — left with no choice but to celebrate their graduation with an online ceremony in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

UIC still plans to hold an in-person commencement for their 2020 class sometime later this year, but with the state’s stay-at-home order banning large gatherings, the virtual stand-in will have to do for now.

And for Mendez, like millions of students nationwide, the COVID-19 shutdown has disrupted far more than just graduation.

Mendez and two of her classmates were the first to come out of UIC’s revamped Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Education program, which resumed in 2017 after a long hiatus.

The culmination of Mendez’s UIC experience — a student-teaching tenure at Benito Juarez High School in Pilsen, where she mentored sophomores and seniors in art classes — was nonetheless cut short by the pandemic.

“I didn’t really get to say goodbye,” she said. “I knew things that they were going through, but we also got to learn from each other. I feel like maybe they could see themselves in me, just because there’s not a lot of teachers of color or women of color that teach in Chicago Public Schools.”

Mendez entered UIC eyeing a career in medicine, but an elective art class she opened her eyes to a field that fulfilled her creativity, her desire to create positive change and her struggles with her own identity.

“I wanted to... give younger students the opportunity of taking art courses that I didn’t have when I was in high school,” she said. “It’s really therapeutic to do so, [because] art is a way to figure out or reflect on your experiences and find your identity and go back to your roots. Because when you are a first-generation [college student] and a Latina, it’s hard to connect when you have these two sides of yourself.”

Her career passion as an art teacher cemented, Mendez has already been accepted into Chicago Public Schools’ early offer program, which guarantees her a job somewhere within the district next school year.

She’s still applying for specific positions, ranging from elementary to high-school level, while planning out how to earn a master’s degree in Latino Studies at some point down the road.

While her final months as an undergraduate might not have gone as planned, Mendez says she finds positives even in that inconvenience.

First, experiencing online classes as a student could help her teach them in the future — perhaps from the get-go, with no guarantee on when in-person classes will be able to resume anywhere in the state as the pandemic unfolds.

And second, “if this wasn’t happening, my dad is constantly working, so he probably wouldn’t have been able to make it [to my graduation],” she said. “But because of this virus happening, he was able to be here, and friends and family were able to congratulate me.”

Mendez is also going to order a cap and gown soon, despite knowing she might not ever get to wear them onstage.

Because those tangible symbols, as thousands of other 2020 college graduates are discovering, are sometimes the only things making the accomplishment feel real these days.

“This all feels surreal because it’s not in-person and it’s not in the traditional way, but it’ll be really exciting,” Mendez said. “That’s finally when it’s going to hit me that I graduated.”",real

Favipiravir/Avigan is an antiviral that has been showing positive outcomes in clinical trials involving 340 patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen according to a statement made by Zhang Xinmin in a report in The Guardian. ""It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,"" Zhang said.

Favipiravir/Avigan was developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical and is being manufactured by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical; and it recently received approval as an experimental treatment for COVID-19 infections, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.

Shenzhen patients positive for COIVD-19 who were given the drug tested negative only 4 days after administration, as compared to a negative test 11 days later for those with no drug treatment. Additionally, lung conditions as shown in X-rays improved in 91% of those taking the drug as compared to 61% of those not taking the drug.

While not as effective in those with severe symptoms, according to Pharmaceutical Technology, Wuhan patients also have had positive results in shortening of duration with fever reduction from an average 4.2 days to 2.5 days.

""We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,"" a source from the Japanese Health Ministry told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, according to The Guardian.

Favipiravir/Avigan is made to treat RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 which are viruses with the main genetic material of RNA rather than DNA, by stopping replication via crippling RNA polymerase enzymes that build RNA. Without the enzyme being entact the virus is not able to duplicate its genetic materials once inside a host cell, according to the drug description published in the journal Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Ser. B, Physical and Biological Sciences.

The Guardian reports that this drug is being used in Japan to treat those with mild to moderate symptoms with positive results, and preliminary findings of these trials have not been published in a peer reviewed scientific journal as of yet.

Other trials have begun to test other drugs and an experimental vaccine in humans. 45 participants are expected to enroll in a vaccine trial in Seattle over the next 6 weeks to test its safety as well as the ability to trigger immune system responses to fight off the coronavirus. If this trial goes well this will be followed up with 2 clinical trial phases that could take up to 12-18 months.",fake

Coronavirus transmission is not black and white — some activities are riskier than others, while some should cause little worry.

As states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all-out quarantine, the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what's safe and what should be avoided.

Harvard Medical School professor Julia Marcus recently argued in The Atlantic that we should remember risk is not binary, and an abstinence-only approach — like that used in some sex education — won't help. ""Likewise, asking Americans to abstain from nearly all in-person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay — at least not forever,"" she wrote.

The company originally announced in March that, as part of its hiring increase to contend with the huge surge in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, it would raise warehouse worker pay by $2 an hour.

The pay increase was temporary, slated to end by May 1st. Now, Amazon is extending the pay bump to help incentivize workers to continue staffing its warehouses and its grocery and package delivery platforms.

“We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community,” an Amazon spokesperson tells CNBC. According to the report, Amazon is currently employing more than 250,000 fulfillment center workers across 110 facilities in the US alone.

Despite these added benefits, Amazon has faced fierce criticism for its handling of health and safety issues during COVID-19. Employees have complained of warehouses remaining open despite workers testing positive for the virus, and Amazon has also been accused of failing to notify employees when they may have come into contact with co-workers who later test positive.

A warehouse worker strike in New York City last month drew national headlines after Amazon fired one of its organizers, claiming he was violating self-isolation guidelines. Leaked documents later revealed Amazon executives’ plans to smear the organizer, Chris Smalls, to discredit the growing labor movement within the company.

Earlier this month, the first Amazon warehouse worker died of COVID-19, and since the Smalls incident, Amazon has fired both corporate employees and other warehouse workers, in what activists and the employees affected say is retaliation for speaking out about the company’s handling of safety issues during the pandemic. The National Labor Relations Board is now looking into whether Amazon is violating its employees’ rights. And today, Amazon tech workers are calling in sick to protest the company’s actions.

“We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies,” an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge with regard to its termination of corporate employees. In relation to warehouse workers it has fired, the company also says the rights it affords to employee to protest “do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.”

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Opinion contributors

In the spring of 1920, spirits in America ran surprisingly high. Despite being in the midst of a temporary economic contraction, the forces that brought about our nation’s infamous booze ban — a blend of progressive elites, religious groups and anti-immigrant advocates — were ecstatic.

In addition to celebrating their political victory in the 18th Amendment, they were already applauding Prohibition for curing many of society’s worst ills. News coverage was often gushing. In January 1921, The Times-Picayune inNew Orleans felt confident enough to (dubiously) assert that Prohibition had created “more money for the poor, more money for the businessman, more money for the workman, more money in the banks.""

But the longer Prohibition wore on, the worse its impact became. Similar to other alcohol-banning experiments throughout human history, the higher the government raised the barriers to obtaining legal alcohol, the riskier the steps people took to get hooch. Black markets ran wild, followed by highly organized — and violent — criminal syndicates that turned booze smuggling into a lucrative business. Americans grew weary of the never-ending enforcement raids and expensive prosecutions.

Spirit of Prohibition is still with us

In 1933, barely a decade after it took effect, Prohibition was relegated to the dust bin of history. Well, at least that’s the popular version of the story. In reality, the 21st Amendment, which officially ushered in Prohibition’s repeal,granted state and local governments vast powers over alcohol. In the immediate aftermath of Prohibition, regulators used this newfound power to enact rules that severely limited access to booze.

Most producers were forced to sell their products through middlemen wholesalers, rather than being able to sell directly to customers. Some states took over wholesaling and retail markets for alcohol entirely. A complicated — and often expensive — licensing system arose that created substantial compliance headaches and a host of difficult to understand retailing rules.

As these laws ossified over time, protectionist forces resisted any attempts to modernize them. Licensees in one sector of the industry, such as restaurants, were often reluctant to allow other types of licensees to encroach on their territory. Powerful wholesalers continued to resist producers being granted the right to sell directly to the public.

Now, a century later, the COVID-19 crisis has triggered — virtually overnight — a mass rethinking of this sclerotic industry. Once the virus hit and government officials were forced to prioritize public health above all else, it became painfully apparent that many of our nation’s alcohol rules were not related to health or safety at all.

Many locales had long forbidden restaurants from selling to-go cocktails, but reform-minded officials started asking: Why? Finding no good answer, places like New York, Texas and Washington, D.C., promptly scrapped these restrictions and allowed carry-out drinks.

Home alone:Ancient advice for drinking at home during coronavirus self-quarantine

Likewise, breweries and distilleries have traditionally been prohibited from delivering beer and spirits in many states, but again, was there any real reason for this? Numerous states decided there was not: Kentucky passed landmark legislation allowing producers of all types of alcohol to ship products directly to in-state customers, while Virginia permanently granted distilleries the right to hand deliver spirits.

Restrictions aren't always safe

At the same time, states like Pennsylvania conveniently demonstrated how a prohibitionist mentality toward alcohol was not only unrelated to health and safety but sometimes actively antithetical to it.

When COVID hit, Pennsylvania shuttered its system of government-run Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores, which led to residents flooding across the border to liquor stores in neighboring states like Ohio, West Virginia and New Jersey. If anything, Pennsylvania’s response jeopardized public health by incentivizing residents to travel far distances rather than sheltering in place.

Crammed into bars:Wisconsin's reopening and it's a hot coronavirus mess. Don't do what we did.

To be sure, there are legitimate state interests around health, safety and welfare when it comes to alcohol. Government has important and laudable goals such as preventing the sale and service of alcohol to minors and intoxicated individuals, limiting negative consequences like drunken driving, and establishing basic rules to stop fraudulent or dangerous products from reaching the market.

At the end of the day, however, alcohol products are not substantially different from many other types of products we regulate in a more modern way. For instance, at the same time many states were restricting alcohol delivery, they were allowing home delivery of pharmaceutical products.

It’s unfortunate that it has taken an international pandemic to force America to reconsider its outdated and protectionist system of alcohol rules. But for the first time in a century, we may finally be turning the page on our prohibitionist past.

Students could have a “Hey Day” and graduation inside Minecraft, just as a Japanese elementary school had organized days earlier.

Quickly, “Penncraft” students began to recreate dormitories, food trucks, and local sculptures in-game. Makarios Chung, an early builder, measured buildings’ dimensions and streets positions constantly to ensure their scale was as accurate as possible. The first day of building, students took an hour to decide the placement of one street. Their main goal was to have a completed campus, specifically Locust Street, for graduating seniors to walk down in-game now that COVID-19 ensured they wouldn’t return to campus and complete this UPenn tradition.

“I’m the first in my family to graduate from college so it wasn’t just my commencement, it was for the rest of my family too,” senior Nyazia Sajdah-Bey says. She left campus suddenly, and is now helping rebuild it in Minecraft, days after departure. “I didn’t have the chance to properly mourn or, finish out my senior bucket list, say goodbye to my friends and teachers,” she says. “I’m still trying to process that loss. So it’s really sweet working on the campus. It’s making the process of leaving feel less sudden and more gradual.” Guo, Chung, and Sajdah-Bey are a few of the hundreds of college students on similar paths of departing and virtually rebuilding.

Students from Boston University to UCLA, from South Louisiana Community College to Northwestern University, have recently created or resurrected Minecraft servers and shared their creations on Discord chats, in Facebook meme groups, and on Reddit threads. The boom of college Minecraft servers has begun. These servers have the express purpose of bringing students together and building, oftentimes focused on recreating their college campuses. Searches for Minecraft server hosting have peaked to unprecedented levels in the last few weeks, and thousands of students are discussing college servers, most notably on the Facebook group “Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens.” Smaller groups and clubs, like Bowdoin College’s men’s ultimate frisbee team or University of La Verne’s debate team, have found ways to bond in survival mode servers after their practices and championships were canceled. Zoom isn’t nearly enough, and it doesn’t carry the ten years of memories that Gen Z has for Minecraft.

“I’m not going to see campus as I remember it.”

An overwhelming number of colleges recently closed their campuses and moved to online courses, which felt like a painful shock to students, especially seniors, who expected to have months more time on campus. I was gutted when I had to pack away my Oberlin College dorm room and drive homeward over a weekend. As I entered self-quarantine, I created an Oberlin server for Minecraft, a game I’ve had for a decade and one that has catalyzed dozens of relationships with people I’ve never met in real life. Our server is small, but I’m able to spend time building a home with my partner and adventuring with seniors that I never said goodbye to. Minecraft has become a salve for many students like myself, and college servers have started to become a place where students can log in to process the sudden loss of an on-campus community — or maybe rebuild it.

“I’m not going to really see campus alive again. I can go to the buildings, I can go to the space, I can go to the actual square, the plot, but I’m not going to see campus as I remember it,” Jay Gibbs, a University of Chicago senior, says. “So from my point of view, it’s basically gone at this point.” Although Minecraft does allow for building 1:1 scale replicas of campuses, just as importantly it allows students to fill campus spaces and interact with each other. After the Penn Relays — the oldest track and field competition in the United States — was canceled for the first time in 125 years, Penncraft started to work with the competition’s staff to host a virtual “speedrunning” version of the Relays in Minecraft. Once each college has a completed in-game campus in the coming weeks, it will be easier to host events; Brown and Columbia are discussing intramural Minecraft Hunger Games.

Even without formal organization, students have come together in college servers in curious ways. In the Oberlin College server I created, I returned one day to find an impromptu food cooperative, a throwback to the famous and culturally significant Oberlin Student Cooperative Association that feeds a fourth of the student body with meals cooked by their peers. This Minecraft version mostly consisted of a chest filled with inedible seeds and raw chicken. On the University of Minnesota server, two students played spikeball on the campus green, tossing a sunflower to each other. In the University of Texas server, students held an in-game birthday party at the top of the famous UT Tower where they set off fireworks and ate cake.

Come May there will be in-game graduations. Inspired by the aforementioned Japanese elementary school, Boston University seniors Rudy Raveendran and Warren Partridge created “Quaranteen University.” This is a new server specifically made to host a Class of 2020 graduation for students from hundreds of different universities. 706 students from 278 institutions have signed up in the last week, and one mom has already emailed Raveendran asking how she can get an in-game seat to this massive ceremony on May 22nd.

The boom of servers has inspired others to quickly organize around them, like Jasper Ty, a Drexel University freshman, who recently recorded and uploaded a Zoom presentation where he ranks the top five college campus builds. “I have heard people call me a college Minecraft server connoisseur,” he says. Spurred by friends, he is considering starting a series of guided tour videos through Minecraft campuses.

Nearly all builders say that they will leave their projects with a newfound appreciation for campus architecture, especially the spots they never visited or overlooked. “It makes me feel like I took this for granted,” Jan Rubio, a UT freshman, says. “Especially knowing that people have toiled to recreate these views and these buildings,” adds Jasper Ty.

It’s true that people have toiled, especially inside the BU build. Last week, Will Pine, a BU junior, journeyed through the deserted BU campus snapping reference photos for the building team, making special note to capture emergency evacuation maps on each floor of the engineering building: they double as well-measured blueprints. On other build Discords, students shared floor plan PDFs that fill in their blindspots for reference photos or memory. Builders can get caught up in small details; a pair of Girl Scouts selling cookies at a crosswalk in the University of Minnesota, or Domino the Cat lounging outside the UT student union building. University of Washington builders went as far as creating a “Building Standards” channel on Discord to formalize road widths, the variety of wood for signs, and the color of concrete blocks used in brutalist constructions.

I won’t be walking through Oberlin College’s Wilder Bowl or Terrell Library anytime soon, and my memory will inevitably erase details of the spaces I spent years in. A campus build server could be a mind palace for me, as it has been for others. “There have been some parts of [the Penncraft] campus where I can stand there and I can feel like I’m standing in the same place in real life, or at least I get the same brainwaves,” Makarios Chung says, remembering a particular frozen courtyard puddle that he slid around on one day. In a moment of new and tragic memories, many students are searching for familiarity. That courtyard is now constructed in the server.

The server boom can be measured. Mitch Smith, the managing director of Minecraft server hosting service Shockbyte, has seen demand for Minecraft servers spike five times higher than their normal daily orders, starting on March 12th (the day after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic). Beyond providing servers to colleges, Smith said in an email that the company’s Shockbyte for Education program has begun hosting servers for “scout groups, kindergartens, homeschooling parents, daycares, and summer camps.” But the graduating class of 2020 have a unique relationship to the game. We grew up with Minecraft updates from middle school to today, the game getting more complex as we aged. Most interviewed students purchased Minecraft during early alpha development, and returning to it now, in their childhood bedrooms, is like returning to an old toy — one with no real endgame.

“I have heard people call me a college Minecraft server connoisseur.”

“If I have an indefinite bit of free time that might end whenever, I would want something I could just play and stop playing whenever I want,” Jay Gibbs says, speaking about why students are flocking to Minecraft during indefinite self-isolation. Years from now, the spires and statues of Quaranteen U might still stand tall. Students might be playing capture the flag in the Frankensteined mix of campuses below. But these servers aren’t collegiate graveyards; they are small wonders currently under construction.

The Berklee School of Music campus build is constructed on a strange lie: some blocks that players see are actually disguised sand. In Minecraft, players can construct a few half-block slabs, but Berklee E-Sports Club President Marc Yu wanted their campus to have slabs of terracotta, glass, and other materials that Minecraft didn’t offer. To get around this, the Berklee builders created dozens of “falling sand” entities in-game that they could re-skin as building materials. Many details of the Berklee build are, technically speaking, a series of sandcastles that are falling apart and being reconstituted almost imperceptibly quickly thanks to the ingenuity of students. Builders like Yu have created an anti-Ozymandias, as their sandcastles will live on as long as the server chugs forward.

For me, there have been many times when Minecraft has been more reliable than Oberlin College. I hope that won’t be the case for graduation. When the world becomes safer, I want to travel back to the town and campus that has meant so much to me and hold commencement in-person. But this May, I might walk across a blocky stage in Quaranteen U to receive my Oberlin diploma. According to the sign-ups, my avatar will be standing beside nursing school seniors, business school seniors, seniors from my hometown college, as well as Canadian and Turkish universities. When I walk across the stage, I will be proud to be with the Class of 2020 in whatever strange and ragtag form that takes.

In a 2015 TED talk, Gates said the world was ""not ready for the next epidemic.""

And in a 2018 discussion about epidemics hosted by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the New England Journal of Medicine, Gates said a pandemic could happen within the next decade.

He presented a simulation by the Institute for Disease Modeling which found that a new flu like the one that killed 50 million people in the 1918 pandemic would now most likely kill 30 million people within six months.

The likelihood that such a disease will appear continues to rise in our interconnected world, he said, whether it happens naturally or is created as a weaponized disease.

""In the case of biological threats, that sense of urgency is lacking,"" he said. ""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.""

Gates said in an April interview with the Financial Times that a viral outbreak will likely happen ""every 20 years or so."" The coronavirus pandemic outbreak will cause future governments to have ""standby diagnostics, deep antiviral libraries, and early warning systems,"" he added.

""The cost of doing all those things well is very small compared to what we're going through here,"" he said. ""And so now people realize, 'OK, there really is a meaningful probability every 20 years or so with lots of world travel that one of these [viruses] will come along.'

Previously the federal organization listed fever, cough, and shortness of breath as symptoms of possible infections, now with the addition of “chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell,” the total has been brought to nine. The additions were made because people “have had a wide range of symptoms reported,” the agency writes on their website in what is the first time they have increased the number of signs of the disease.

These additions have been reported by many who have been confirmed to have COVID-19. But these are not the only symptoms being widely reported in common to those confirmed with the virus, others are reported to include skin rash, runny nose, red eyes, diarrhea, and fatigue. Additionally left untreated it does not take like for even mild symptoms to turn serious as the virus invades the lungs.

According to the CDC those who have “trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in their chest, new confusion or inability to arouse or have bluish lips or face” should seek immediate medical attention.

From the CDC website:

Older adults and those with severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at a higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

Those with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.

These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus:

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Chills

Repeated shaking with chills

Muscle pain

This briefing has ended. Read global live updates on the coronavirus here.

Countries around the world are weighing the costs and benefits of reopening society.The coronavirus pandemic continued its global assault on Saturday, with more than 1.7 million known cases recorded worldwide and at least 107,000 deaths.
But even as some countries join the list of those with broad lockdown orders and others maintain or extend sweeping shutdowns, others have begun eyeing the benefits of reopening at least some parts of society.
In Iran, the hardest-hit country so far in its region, some government offices and shops, factories and other businesses began reopening on Saturday as the national lockdown is lifted in phases. President Hassan Rouhani had said last week that economic and government activity must continue. On Saturday, he said that people should still observe social distancing.
The lifting of restrictions came despite warnings from the country’s health ministry that the reopening could cause a new spike in cases and tens of thousands of additional deaths.
Some of the most grievously hit countries in Europe, while still recording hundreds of new deaths every day, say that the worst appears to be past. Their plans to ease some restrictions, they caution, will not bring normalcy, but instead a new phase of learning how to safely live with the pandemic.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Spain, with the world’s highest caseload after the United States, is preparing to allow some nonessential employees to return to work on Monday. The country has reported a falling death rate and a daily growth in new cases of about 3 percent, compared with 20 percent in mid-March.
But officials stressed the limits of that easing. “Spain continues in a state of lockdown,” Health Minister Salvador Illa warned  on Friday. “We are not yet in a de-escalation phase.”
Italy, which follows Spain in cases but has the highest death toll after the United States, will allow some bookstores, children’s clothing shops and some forestry-related occupations to resume operations after the current restrictions expire on Tuesday.
Austria plans to reopen smaller shops after this weekend. The Czech Republic is opening small stores, and people can play tennis and go swimming.  Denmark may reopen kindergartens and schools starting next week, Norway will allow pupils to attend kindergarten.
And China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged.For many countries, the question of whether to ease restrictions does not have a clear answer yet. In the United States, President Trump — and governors of each state — are balancing calls from medical experts to keep restrictions in place with pleas from bankers, corporate executives and industrialists to ease them.
India, on the other hand, appears set to extend a 21-day lockdown for all 1.3 billion citizens for two more weeks, carrying it to the end of April. During a meeting with top officials, Mr. Modi said the lockdown had helped blunt the outbreak but that “constant vigilance is paramount,” according to a statement from his office.
Some countries put in place new measures. Turkey on Friday ordered a two-day curfew for 31 provinces. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has ordered air traffic to the country halted after more than 70 people who arrived from Newark, N.J., on Saturday morning left Ben Gurion Airport without official verifications of their mandatory quarantine plans and checks of their temperatures.
A Times examination reveals the extent of President Trump’s slow response to the virus, which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives in the U.S.
Throughout January, as President Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues, an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.
Dozens of interviews and a review of emails and other records by The New York Times revealed many previously unreported details of the roots and extent of Mr. Trump’s halting response.  Read the full investigation.
The country now has more than 515,000 confirmed cases, by far the world’s largest count, and more than 20,000 deaths, surpassing Italy’s as the world’s heaviest toll.  More than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs.
Here’s what else is happening in the United States:On Saturday,  the U.S. surpassed Italy in the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus with 20,109. Government projections obtained by The New York Times  found that without any mitigation, the death toll from the virus could have reached 300,000 — and that it could reach 200,000 if the Trump administration lifts 30-day stay-at-home orders.  Read the latest updates for the United States. Christians across the United States prepared to celebrate Easter by gathering virtually on Sunday, largely following stay-at-home orders and guidance from health officials. A handful of lone pastors in states like Louisiana and Mississippi plan to hold in-person services in defiance of restrictions on mass gatherings, citing their religious freedoms. President Trump said in a tweet that he will watch the online service of First Baptist Dallas, led by Robert Jeffress, one of his prominent supporters.The largest states are split on when and how to reopen. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have started talking about reopening businesses and schools, echoing signals from Mr. Trump. But the leaders of California and New York, both Democrats, are sounding more cautious notes. Top officials in New York,  the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 180,000 cases, appear to disagree over whether New York City schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Read the latest updates for the New York region.Citing the virus, the Trump administration announced that it would issue visa penalties on countries that refuse to accept people the U.S. aims to deport. With so many restaurants and schools closed and other sources of demand disrupted, many of the largest farms in the country are  being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they haven’t been able to sell or donate to food banks, which can only absorb so much perishable food.
As coronavirus cases rise in Latin America, murder rates fall.
As countries contend with escalating body counts from the pandemic, some are experiencing an unanticipated decline in a different form of death: murder.
Lockdowns have reduced opportunities for homicides and other crimes, and the virus has taken some criminals out of action as they hunker down in their homes. Some gangs have even led efforts to impose curfews in neighborhoods where they hold sway.
The drop in murders is especially notable in Latin America, the region with the highest homicide rates in the world outside of war.
In El Salvador, for example, there were just 65 homicides in March, down from 114 in February. Neighboring Honduras has also seen a falloff in killings in recent weeks, as has Colombia and the most populous state in Mexico.
The pandemic is “taking people off the streets,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. “The rule of thumb is: the stricter the lockdown, the bigger the effect on crimes committed against strangers on the street.”
Here are other developments in the pandemic around the world:Italy’s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world’s deadliest, counting more than 152,000 cases and more than 19,450 deaths. Health care workers have been hard-hit, and so has another force on the front lines: The virus has killed nearly 100 priests.France, which has the world’s fifth largest known outbreak, reported on Saturday that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the third day in a row, to roughly 6,880. With nearly 94,000 cases, the country has logged more than 13,800 deaths.Tokyo reported a record number of new cases on Saturday, at 197. The city has confirmed a total of 40 deaths from the virus. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan had not yet hit its target of reducing commuting by at least 70 percent, and asked all businesses to let employees work from home.Chile will start handing out certificates to people who have recovered that will exempt them from quarantines and other restrictions.The World Health Organization said that it was looking into reports of some recovering Covid-19 patients testing positive again after testing negative, a day after South Korean officials said that 91 previously cleared patients had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus might have been “reactivated” rather than the patients being reinfected.
China delays exports of ventilators and other crucial medical supplies for quality checks.
The Chinese government has ordered that no more N95 respirators, ventilators, hospital gowns and other key medical supplies be exported until customs officials perform quality inspections on each shipment.
The new policy, announced by China’s General Administration of Customs on Friday, produced immediate delays to cargos on Saturday as manufacturers, freight agents and traders tried to understand how to comply. China is the world’s dominant producer of a wide range of medical supplies, and its manufacturing lead has widened in many sectors as it has engaged in a nationwide mobilization of medical supplies production since late January.
The Chinese customs agency said that it had previously checked whether medical supplies were accurately counted, whether they infringed foreign patents and other intellectual property, and whether they had fraudulent documents. But now the agency will also assess the quality of goods.
The agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing might take.The policy comes after a series of complaints from Europe that medical supplies from China had problems. Chinese officials have countered that many of these supplies were industrial respirators that were not designed to meet medical standards and should not be expected to do so.
The new rules cover China’s exports in 11 categories: medical respirators and surgical masks, medical protective clothing, infrared thermometers, ventilators, surgical caps, medical goggles, medical gloves, medical shoe covers, patient monitors, medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants.
Montreal police open a criminal investigation into deaths at a nursing home.
The police in Montreal said on Saturday night that they had launched a criminal investigation into a private residence for the elderly after 31 people had died there since March 13, at least five of them from confirmed cases of Covid-19.
Quebec’s premier, François Legault, said that the government had learned of the deaths at the 150-bed Résidence Herron, in a suburb west of Montreal, on Friday, and that he believed they amounted to “gross negligence.”
“This is terrible what happened,” Mr. Legault said on Saturday, adding that when officials from the regional health authority had arrived at the residence on March 29 to investigate, “almost all the staff was gone.”
At that point, he said, the authority dispatched a team of health workers to care for the residents, and it has now taken over the running of the residence.
An investigation by Montreal Gazette, a local newspaper, said that residents had been discovered unfed and wearing clothing covered with feces.
Mr. Legault said that it was “unacceptable” how the elderly were being cared for in Quebec, and that staff shortages and insufficient salaries had been an ongoing issue at privately run residences. “I am not proud to see what is happening,” he said.
Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company called Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. The company was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. But it previously said it had been doing its best under challenging circumstances.
Quebec has been hit hard by the coronavirus. As of Saturday, it had 12,292 confirmed cases and 289 deaths. More than 90 percent of those who have died were 70 or older.
Officials said Saturday that after one resident at the Herron had tested positive for the virus, regional health authorities had reached out to the residence to learn more about the status of its residents, but were rebuffed. The authorities then obtained a court order to gain access to medical files, and learned of the number of deaths on Friday.
Quebec’s minister of health, Danielle McCann, ordered checks of private residences for the elderly across the province.
More than 50 workers chose isolation at their power plant to keep Vienna’s lights on.
The global pandemic has forced countless people into isolation. In Vienna, for the sake of the entire city, 53 people volunteered.
They raised their hands to ensure that whatever else happens, the power plants that provide electricity to Austria’s capital and its 2 million people would keep running.
The 53 employees of the Wien Energie company have been holed up in four power plants since March 20, after volunteering to go into their own version of a lockdown until April 16. Depending on how things go, they could be asked to stay on longer.
The workers miss their families, but shrug off the idea that they are making a big sacrifice, pointing out that doctors, nurses and other health workers had it much tougher.
“We are just a cog in a much bigger wheel,” said Steven Sacher, 24, an engineer at the Flötzersteig plant.
Wien Energie turned conference rooms into dormitories, and outfitted the plants with washing machines, fitness equipment, wireless internet — and, crucially, board games and jigsaw puzzles.
“We have finished about 20 puzzles with 2,000 pieces,” Mr. Wallner said. “Everyone who has time stops and works on it a bit.”
Mr. Sacher said his team has been piecing together a puzzle showing the Brooklyn Bridge at night, which gives way to an evening ritual.
“Every night at 9 p.m. sharp, the four of us who aren’t working get together and play Parcheesi,” he said.
Pope Francis will say Easter Mass and deliver an annual message by live-stream.
Last year, the Vatican’s police force estimated that 70,000 faithful crammed into St. Peter’s Square on Easter morning to hear the pope deliver his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) message after the Easter Mass.
But on Sunday, Pope Francis won’t impart his Easter message and blessing from a window in the apostolic palace, from where he greets the faithful most Sundays. Instead, Francis will live-stream the Mass, followed by the message and a blessing, on the Vatican news website, starting at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. Eastern).
People are prohibited from gathering in the square. And the Francis will celebrate Mass with just a few assistants inside the empty basilica.
The Vatican also live-streamed the Via Crucis, the traditional Good Friday procession that evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ’s crucifixion, in St. Peter’s Square instead of Rome’s Colosseum, where it is traditionally held. At the end of the procession, Francis prayed silently before a wooden crucifix that had been carried during Rome’s 16th-century plague.
Earlier Friday, Francis called an Italian state TV Good Friday special to say he felt close to the victims of the pandemic, and that he was thinking about the “doctors, nurses, nuns and priests who had died on the front lines as soldiers, giving their life for love.”
In this pandemic, many are resisting, in their communities, in hospitals, caring for the ill. “Even today people are crucified, and die for love,” Francis said.
At over 100 years old, they’ve defied the odds and beat the virus.
As the coronavirus pandemic takes a disproportionate toll on older people around the world, several over the age of 100 have survived the brutal toll the disease takes on the body.
Cornelia Ras, 107, of the Netherlands is believed to be the oldest known survivor of the new coronavirus. She became ill last month after attending a church service on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the southwest part of the country.
Ms. Ras was given the all clear by her doctor on Monday.“We did not expect her to survive this,” her niece Maaike de Groot told the Dutch newspaper AD. “She takes no medicines, still walks well and gets down on her knees every night to thank the Lord. From the looks of it, she will be able to continue to do so.”
Keith Watson, a 101-year-old man from western England, was in a hospital last month awaiting surgery when he developed a fever that prompted doctors to test him for the coronavirus, local health officials said.
But he pulled through, and on Thursday, he was discharged after recovering from the virus. “He’s amazing for his age,” his daughter-in-law Jo Watson told the BBC.
On March 9, Ada Zanusso, 103, was one of several residents of a nursing home in the town of Lessona, Italy, to become ill with the coronavirus. Twenty people had already died there, the newspaper La Repubblica reported.
“She was ill for a week, even with critical moments,” said Carla Furno Marchese, Mrs. Zanusso’s family doctor since 1986, who also works with the nursing home.
Then, “miraculously,” Dr. Furno Marchese said in an interview, Ms. Zanusso improved. “She reacquired some strength, started eating again and then she got out of bed,” the doctor said. “Now she’s perfectly normal, like before. She’s doing great. She remembers everything.”
Her recovery has been embraced by many Italians still reeling from the toll the virus has taken on the country, which is enduring a lockdown. Ms. Zanusso had lived alone at home until four years ago, when she broke her femur and her children decided she would be better off in a care home. She had always been in good health, and has a deep faith.
 “She accepts everything that happens to her,” the doctor said.
Tech giants team up to track the virus, as South Korea tightens its leading program.
In one of the most far-ranging attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it.
The technology giants, usually fierce rivals, said they aimed to release the tool within several months, building it into the operating systems of billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world.
Users would opt in and voluntarily report if they became infected, and the smartphones would log other devices they came near, enabling “contact tracing” of the disease, a measure that has proved effective, alongside mass testing in places like South Korea.
“It could be a useful tool, but it raises privacy issues,” said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who is helping San Francisco officials with contact tracing. “It’s not going to be the sole solution, but as part of a robust sophisticated response, it has a role to play.”
South Korea, which has used a government-issued tracking app to trace contacts and enforce quarantine, said on Saturday that it planned to strap tracking wristbands on those who violated self-quarantine orders.
Health officials worry that some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home for two weeks have slipped out, leaving their smartphones behind.
Yoon Tae-ho, a senior disease-control official, told reporters on Saturday that the bands would be deployed within two weeks.
Officials admitted that they lacked a legal power to enforce wristband-wearing, but could consider lighter quarantine-breaking penalties to those who agreed to wear them.
South Korea has reported between 27 and 53 new cases per day this week compared with several hundred a day between late February and early March.
A British minister draws backlash for urging no ‘overuse’ of protective gear.
The British health secretary, Matt Hancock, has sparked anger among workers in the country’s National Health Service after he urged them not to waste personal protective equipment.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned on Saturday that supplies of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., were dangerously low in London and part of northern England, and said that doctors were putting their lives at risk to treat patients with the coronavirus.
“It’s really important that people don’t overuse P.P.E.,” Mr. Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Saturday. “It’s a precious resource.”
At a daily briefing on Friday, he said that masks and aprons did not have to be changed after treating each patient.
But the Royal College of Nursing’s general secretary, Donna Kinnair, told BBC’s “Breakfast” show: “I take offense, actually, that we are saying that health care workers are abusing or overusing P.P.E. I think what we know is, we don’t have enough supply.”
The opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, also said on Twitter: “It is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe.”
Mr. Hancock also said on Saturday that 19 health service workers had died so far in the outbreak. Britain reported a daily total of 917 deaths in hospitals on Saturday, after a high of 980 on Friday. The total death toll stood at 9,975 as of Saturday.
He said the outbreak had yet to peak, although there were signs of hospital admissions “starting to flatten.”
With temperatures expected to reach up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend, government officials have warned the British public to continue to abide by lockdown restrictions.
The condition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has continued to improve, his office said in a statement on Friday, adding that he had “been able to do short walks, between periods of rest.” He left intensive care on Thursday after three nights but remains in a hospital.
After giving a rare televised address to the nation on Sunday, Queen Elizabeth II again delivered a message to Britons. She encouraged people to continue practicing social distancing and said that “Easter isn’t canceled.”
“We know that coronavirus will not overcome us,” she said. “As dark as death can be, particularly for those suffering with grief, light and life are greater.”
The pandemic is bringing old internet dreams to life.
It’s been decades since utopian thinkers dreamed that cyberspace would miraculously fix societal woes. Yet the pandemic has prompted some to realize that social media — where we normally just promote ourselves — can be mobilized for building a sense of community.
In the United States, artists are singing opera, reading poetry and doing standup comedy on You-Tube and Instagram. These days, our reporter writes in The New York Times Magazine, online performances feel “as though they were really less about pure entertainment and more about serving a nation, a world even, that was suffering in isolation and fear.”
Healing practitioners have also made meditation sessions, yoga classes and other mental-health assistance available free online. And GoFundMe is a vehicle for distributing money to people hit hardest by the crisis, including sex workers and underinsured artists.

As spring turns to summer and then fall, and we’re be able to take fuller stock of the devastation, we’ll know which industries came out stronger, which need to reinvent themselves, and which unfortunately will never come back. With the benefit of hindsight, one thing that will be made abundantly clear is the need for organized labor in times of crisis.

Opinion

In late March, when Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued stay-at-home restrictions for Illinois residents and required most operations to close, he exempted essential businesses and encouraged them to remain open. Construction workers, many of whom were building hospitals, long-term care facilities and other vital infrastructure, were asked to stay on the job.

The hardworking men and women of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters answered the call. This was not a decision members took lightly. They knew of the health risks involved with projects such as converting McCormick Place into a 3,000-bed alternate care facility. But, as our members said, “Sometimes you have look past yourself.”

But it’s not just a sense a duty compelling the thousands of union carpenters doing their part to help contain the spread. They go to work knowing their union has their back every step of the way. Among the many lessons we will learn from the COVID-19 pandemic is its demonstration of the importance of union membership for essential workers.

Of all the injustices exposed by the pandemic, the risks faced by non-union workers have become the most apparent. Non-union workers are being asked to risk their safety with little or no protections of their own. This is why we’re seeing a groundswell of strikes and walk-offs from delivery drivers and other workers on the front lines.

The construction industry is no different. Many non-union construction workers do not have health insurance — about 54%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Because they often are paid under the table, non-union workers also can struggle to access unemployment benefits. Their unemployment insurance, Social Security and other benefits are not withheld from their paychecks.

Compare the experience of non-union construction workers with what building trades unions across the country are providing for their members. The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters has a dedicated safety department and staff working round the clock answering questions and visiting job sites to make sure they are compliant with CDC health and safety guidelines. We’ve also extended health insurance eligibility for members who lost coverage due to a reduction of hours worked and are providing 100% coverage for testing, office visits, ER and urgent care visits relating to COVID-19, among other benefit adjustments.

Our number one priority will always be fighting tooth and nail for our members. We’ve been doing that since 1881 and will never let up.

It’s important to remember that union efforts don’t just benefit the members we represent. Unions raise wages for everyone, especially the middle-class. A recent study done by researchers from the Illinois Economic Policy Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and University of California, Irvine found that labor unions boost worker incomes by lifting hourly wages by an average of 11%.

The Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters is proud of our record of service, protecting our members’ health and welfare, and raising the standard of living for the middle class. We look forward to new members joining the union movement and having a collective voice.

While we’re strong alone, we’re unstoppable together.

Gary Perinar is executive secretary-treasurer of the Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters.

1442,1073,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/face-masks-gloves-appointments-gyms-amid-covid-19/story?id=70628201,2020-05-15,Face masks? Gloves? Appointments? What gyms will look like amid COVID-19,"Face masks? Gloves? Appointments? What gyms will look like amid COVID-19 An expert shares five tips to stay as safe as possible back at the gym.

Gyms are known for being social places where people share equipment, are often in close quarters with strangers and sweat together.

All of that is changing as gyms start to reopen in parts of the U.S. amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In Oklahoma -- where gyms were allowed to reopen on May 1 with social distancing and sanitation protocols in place -- some gym members are wearing gloves and masks as they exercise, according to Julie Hibbard, who owns an Anytime Fitness franchise in Ardmore, Oklahoma.

""I added restrictions like a strong suggestion to wear masks, mandatory wiping down of equipment and we only have 25% capacity [of members inside the gym],"" said Hibbard, adding that she watches the gym's security cameras to make sure protocols are followed. ""I also added social distancing, so [members and staff] have to keep 15 feet away from people inside the gym.""

Hibbard, who also owns three gyms in Texas, said she also has a professional cleaning staff that cleans the gym every day and a staff member who cleans the gym hourly, a sign of the additional precautions most gyms will be expected to take.

In Texas, where gyms will be allowed to open on May 18, Kaitlyn Gannon, the owner of Dallas Iron Fitness, is busy making adjustments to her two private, boutique gym locations so that they can reopen.

""All of our members, upon entering, will have to wash their hands. We'll have spray bottles around the gym and members are required to spray down equipment after the first touch,"" she told ""GMA."" ""Every member has to wash their hands when they’re done and we have antibacterial hand sanitizer at the front and they have to put that on as they leave.""

The gym's personal trainers will rely on verbal cues in order to maintain a safe distance from clients and will wear masks as needed and members will have to book appointments to work out, according to Gannon. The gym will start a modified class schedule one week after it opens, with only two to five people per class instead of the usual 15.

""The environment is just going to be totally different and the support we need is immeasurable,"" said Gannon, whose second gym location opened the day before stay-at-home orders were put in place in Texas. ""Know that gym owners and staff are doing everything possible to open up in a clean environment.""

Nationally, gyms and boutique studios -- even ones that have not yet announced plans to reopen -- are already giving their members a glimpse of what the future will look like.

Equinox, a national gym chain, has told members they will need to book visits via the gym's app and will have their temperatures checked upon entry using touchless thermometers. Members will also be required to wear masks except while ""vigorously training"" and have to follow guidelines to accommodate for social distancing.

Extra luxuries like saunas, pools, showers, kids' clubs and basketball courts will also be closed during the initial reopening of gyms, according to Equinox.

Soul Cycle, a national chain of cycling studios owned by Equinox, is planning to limit the number of riders in each class to allow for social distancing and is encouraging riders to wait outside or in their cars before class. They will also check the temperatures of their staff members and also riders if required by state or local governments, according to the chain's website.

And Gold's Gym, which already has opened around five company-owned gyms and over 20 franchise gyms across the U.S., has spaced out its cardio and strength equipment to meet social distancing standards. Company-owned gyms are requiring staff to wear face masks and gloves and recommending that members wear masks as well, in addition to instituting additional cleaning protocols such as a cleaning intermission between 1 and 2 p.m. local time.

The gyms that have already reopened are reporting a record number of people signing up for new memberships, according to Gold’s Gym President and CEO Adam Zeitsiff.

""They'd never been a member before. They just wanted to be active, wanted to be healthy,"" Zeitsiff told ABC News of the new members. ""They probably were sick of being at home and decided this was time for me to make that emotional decision.""

How to know if it's safe to return to the gym

The reopening of gyms across the U.S. is happening at the same time that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to rise in this country, reaching more than 1.3 million diagnosed cases and at least 82,548 deaths.

People who live in areas where COVID-19 still has a major presence and are viewed as vulnerable -- those age 65 and older and people with pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes -- should exercise caution still when it comes to returning to a gym or boutique fitness studio, according to Dr. Simone Wildes, a Boston-based infectious disease specialist.

""If you live in an area with large numbers of COVID-19 cases, it places you at higher risk for contracting the disease, so it might not be wise to return to the gym at this time,"" she told ""GMA."" ""And the vulnerable population might have to wait until vaccines and effective treatments are available. They should sign up for virtual classes or continue to exercise outdoors.""

""However, if you live in an area of low incidence of the virus, and your gym has taken all the necessary steps, then I would return. However, if not reassured by the measures at the gym, I would continue my workout at home and outdoors,"" Wildes added.

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 at the gym comes not from sweat -- there is no evidence that virus is spread through sweat -- but through frequently touched surfaces, like weights, strength machines and treadmills, that you may touch and then touch your face, eyes, nose and mouth, increasing the risk of contracting the virus, according to Wildes.

It is also more difficult to maintain the recommended six feet of physical distance from another person inside a gym than it would be outdoors or inside your own home. The main way the virus is spread is through respiratory droplets via coughing and sneezing, but also when breathing hard and forcefully exhaling, as commonly occurs during exercise, experts say.

If you are ready to head back to the gym, here are Wildes' five recommendations to stay as safe as possible.

1. Practice safe social distancing: Maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people in the gym, recommends Wildes.

2. Clean equipment before and after use: ""Definitely clean the equipment before and after use and use and use hand sanitizer between equipment use.""

3. Wear gloves: ""I would wear workout gloves as well for extra layer of protection from touching high touch surface areas.""

4. Wear a cloth face covering: ""The CDC has recommended that a cloth face covering be worn in public settings where other social distancing measures will be difficult to be enforced especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Wear cloth face coverings that you can breathe through comfortably and your nose and mouth are fully covered. The mask should fit snugly against the sides of your face so there are no gaps.""

""The face covering should be either tied or secured to prevent slipping while working out. Wash mask after use. Try not to touch your eyes, mouth or nose when removing mask from face and wash or sanitize your hands immediately after removal.""

5. Make sure your gym is taking all necessary precautions: Wildes recommends reading your gym's COVID-19 guidelines to make sure the below questions are answered, and asking the gym directly if they are not.

- How will the club limit the individuals in the facility while maintaining social distancing requirements and how will this be managed?

- Will there be signs and floor markers in place to help members?

- Will there be temperature checks or just symptom checks to enter the building?

- What are your cleaning protocols? Will equipment be cleaned before and after use with EPA-approved disinfectants. Any additional cleaning with UV lighting?

- How will staff be protected -- i.e. the cleaning staff, personal trainers and front desk staff -- from coronavirus and will they be given personal protective equipment?

- Do you have a return to work policy in place for employees that are COVID-19 positive?

- Will there be continual training and updates of staff on COVID-19?

- Will there be group exercise or small groups happening?

- How will social distancing on free weights and cardio machines be enforced?

- Will all the members be required to wear a face mask during workouts and do you have masks on hand for those without masks?

- Are childcare services available and what protocols are in place for adequate sanitation?

- Will there be fans and will doors and windows be opened to keep air moving?

- What is the communication protocol for informing members of the gym if others members are diagnosed with COVID-19?

Editor, Health Impact News

As we have previously reported here at Health Impact News, doctors all across the world have seen great success in treating COVID-19 patients with high-dose intravenous Vitamin C therapy.

When we first reported on doctors doing this in China just after the Wuhan outbreak, Facebook tagged us as “Fake News” and took away our ability to advertise and boost any of our articles. See:

Since that time, we have reported on how many doctors and hospitals here in the U.S. have also successfully used the treatment. See:

Now, a doctor in Michigan has actually had his clinic raided by the FBI and arrested being accused of “committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud” because he treated his patients with Vitamin C.

Michigan Doctor Charged with Felonies for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C

by Shane Trejo

Big League Politics

Excerpts:

A Michigan doctor has had his Metro Detroit clinic raided following allegations that he was “illegally” treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C.

Dr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been accused of committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He is being charged in federal court for these supposed crimes.

Mok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.

Federal jackboots surrounded the Allure facility and raided it last week.

Ventura and Santa Barbara got the green light under Gov. Gavin Newsom’s newly amended criteria that accounts for regional variance among the state’s 58 counties, some of which say they are more ready than others to re-open economies and ease stay-home restrictions in place since March.

Under the new criteria, counties must show evidence of meeting key benchmarks to move more quickly. For example:

The county must meet one of these goals that show hospitalizations have stabilized:

The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized each day can’t go up by more than 5%, averaged over seven days.

Or, there can be no more than 20 COVID-19 hospitalizations on any single day during a 14-day period. (This is meant for smaller counties.)

It also must meet one of these goals related to confirmed cases:

Fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days, or

Less than 8% of all people whose test results came back in the past seven days were positive.

And it must achieve this goal related to testing:

A minimum daily testing volume of 1.5 people tested per 1,000 residents per day, averaged over seven days.

Other benchmarks include creating a plan for contract tracing and the workforce capacity for the effort; providing proof that it enough availability temporary housing units to shelter at least 15% of its homeless; securing a strategy for protecting vulnerable communities, such as people in nursing homes; delivering a timeline for opening all the categories of businesses in Phase 2; and doing the math to show the metrics that would use to measure if it’s time re-tighten restrictions.

In attesting to meeting the benchmarks, Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin noted that the average number of patients hospitalized had fallen by 3.4% over seven days ending on May 16; that the cumulative incidence rate over 14 days was at 16.6 per 100,000 residents and that it’s testing capacity — at 1,360 tests per day — remains well above the bencmark of 1,280 tests per day. The county’s volume had not matched its capacity because the Safer-at-Home order has kept the number of symptomatic people needing testing low. But the county was able to show a plan to increase testing, including surveillance testing of vulnerable populations. That will help the county meet the state’s required volume, according to Ventura officials.

Ventura County joins 38 of the state’s 58 counties aiming to move forward quickly in what is called Accelerated Phase 2 of a 4-phase process to ease restrictions that have shut down economies in the effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. That effort has worked to flatten the curve, public health officials say. But it’s also devastated local economies and government budgets, prompting renewed efforts to re-open sooner in areas where that can happen.

Moving further down Stage 2 allows for counties to open up “destination retail (retail stores), including shopping malls and swap meets; dine-in restaurants (other amenities, like bars or gaming areas, are not permitted in Stage 2); and schools with modifications. All this, along with the already allowed curbside retail and other services, such as car washes and pet grooming.

L.A. County — with its 10 million residents — includes nearly 50% of the state’s cases and nearly 60% of its deaths. Nonetheless, it is making progress toward meeting Newsom’s criteria:

Hospitalization: The county’s rate hasn’t just stabilized, it’s been trending down — from 1,742 people on May 14 to 1,516 people on May 21. That comes to a daily average of -1.6%, well under the benchmark.

Confirmed cases: L.A. County would have to drop below 2,543 new cases in two weeks to meet this criteria through the first option — five times lower than its current two-week total. But it can meet the criteria through the second option — only about 5% of test results the county has received in the past week have been positive.

L.A. County needs to average 15,259 tests per day to meet this. Just this week, it has started hitting that target — it’s gotten results back for an average of 18,714 tests in the past seven days, officials have said.

County officials say they are trying to balance the urgency to re-open the region’s economy while also sticking to public health goals to avoid a resurgence in the disease.

In Ventura, officials will start by opening with dine-in restaurants and in-store shopping, which must observe social distancing orders. Destination shopping, such as malls, will not immediately open, according to the county’s plan.

“With reopening and more Ventura County residents coming into contact with one another, we are concerned that cases of COVID-19 may increase, along with hospitalizations, and even deaths,” Ventura officials’ opening plan notes.",real

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the two federal agencies said.

China has denied involvement in any cyberattacks on COVID-19 research organizations.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US federal agencies on Wednesday said Chinese hackers were targeting COVID-19 research operations and attempting to gather information on subjects including vaccines and treatments.

The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday said ""PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors"" had been observed ""attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.""

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the agencies said. ""The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.""

Wednesday's announcement was issued to raise awareness among healthcare, pharmaceutical, and research operations that might be targeted. The FBI and the CISA suggested that at-risk organizations ""maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices,"" such as patching critical vulnerabilities, actively scanning for unauthorized access, and strengthening authentication processes.

Last week, US and UK security agencies issued a joint statement warning of cybersecurity threats to the operations of organizations involved in responding to the coronavirus, saying that unnamed actors were targeting ""national and international healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and local government with the likely aim of gathering information related to the coronavirus outbreak.""

The warning issued Wednesday was more specific, calling attention to suspected Chinese activity in the networks of related organizations.

The Chinese government has denied involvement in such cyberattacks on US organizations.

""China is a staunch upholder of cybersecurity and a victim to cyberattacks,"" a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said this week. ""We firmly oppose and fight all kinds of cyberattacks conducted by hackers.""

""We are leading the world in COVID-19 treatment and vaccine research,"" he added. ""It is immoral to target China with rumors and slanders in the absence of any evidence.""

The FBI and CISA said additional details on the threat posed by cybercriminals would be released in the coming days.

The warning from these two US federal agencies comes at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Beijing, with each side criticizing the other for failures in responding appropriately to the coronavirus.

""What else is new with China? I'm not happy with China, could have stopped it at the source, should have,"" President Donald Trump said Monday when asked about reports that Chinese hackers were targeting COVID-19 research. ""Now you're telling me they're hacking. What else is new? We're watching very closely.""",real
1456,1523,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/covid-19-and-changing-sleep-patterns/,2020-05-20,COVID-19 AND CHANGING SLEEP PATTERNS,"Article courtesy of Joseph Maroon, MD, FACS

Obtaining a good night’s sleep is a vital daily routine that many people just don’t do. Whether it is due to work, child care, a noisy environment, or something else, unfortunately few Americans make sleep a priority. Additionally, even if people try to sleep more, according to a report from the CDC, about 30% of adults in America still have trouble sleeping most nights. Additionally, 68%, or about 164 million Americans, struggle with sleep at least once a week.

Over the last 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemia sleep changes are just one of the innumerable daily activities that have been impacted by the virus. In a report from late March 2020, by the makers of Fitbit(TM), they found that their sleep tracker app was reporting major changes in sleep patterns of millions of Americans.

“People are going to bed later but getting more sleep, as well as more quality rest. For those whose quality of sleep has improved, they have been spending more time in deep and REM sleep” They also noted the importance of adequate sleep. “Your body recharges while you sleep, both repairing and building tissue and muscle. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol fall during the evening. And, getting your recommended seven to nine hours a night also boosts your immunity—something that’s more important than ever right now. “

From a report about one month later by the Smithsonian in late April 2020, researchers began to study other more ominous changes in sleep patterns. Various sleep study centers around the world reported increasingly strange and vivid dreams from those who entered their second month of stay-at-home orders .They reported:

“A growing group is experiencing insomnia, an inability to fall asleep. Both seem to be symptoms of stress, part of the shared anxiety surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These are typical anxiety dreams and it’s acted out with vivid imagination in dreams.”

In the same report, they noted researchers in France, at the The Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, had found a 35 percent increase in dream recall and a 15 percent increase in negative dreams.

“For people not on the front lines of healthcare and emergency response, fears of the novel coronavirus are projected onto threats like zombies, bugs, and shadowy figures, which represent the pandemic metaphorically.”

Dreams tend to occur during the rapid eye movement, or REM, phase of sleep. Anxiety and low activity during the day can make it harder to get a good night’s sleep, and frequently waking up during the night can increase the likelihood that dreams are remembered the next day.

REM sleep, that is associated with dreaming, is thought to help us handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions. Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety. It’s imperative that we give our bodies and brains the rest and relaxation it needs. Not only to allow us to enter REM sleep and cope with stress, a good night’s sleep increases production of the vital hormones and neurotransmitters that our brain needs replenished each day.

According to Sleepfoundation.org, here are some of the ways you can cope with the profound changes of activity and stress that may be affecting your sleep during the COVID 19 pandemic:

Set Your Schedule and Routine – avoid major variation in your daily sleep time –

Same Wake-Up time every day.

Wind-Down Time -relax and get ready for bed

Bedtime – keep it consistent

Showering and getting dressed even if you aren’t leaving the house

Eating meals at the same time each day

Blocking off specific time periods for work and exercise

Avoid Naps

Reserve your Bed For Sleep

Avoid bringing a computer into bed to do work or watch a movie

Frequently changing your sheets, fluffing your pillows, and making your bed can keep your bed feeling fresh to doze off.

See the Light

Exposure to light plays a crucial role in helping our bodies regulate sleep since light-based cues have a positive effect on your circadian rhythm.

If you can, spend some time outside in natural light.

As much as possible, open windows and blinds to let light into your home during the day.

Avoid too much blue light produced by electronic devices that interfere with the body’s natural sleep-promoting processes

We know that those numbers are only a fraction of the families that have been impacted by the virus. Many more are losing income, having hours reduced, getting sick or being forced to choose between getting sick and getting a paycheck.

Magdalena Zylinska, a single mother who works cleaning houses in Chicago, has to choose between continuing to work and put food on the table or staying home to keep her 12-year-old son safe. “I can’t even sleep at night, to figure out which bills to pay or not pay,” she says.

Opinion

First-generation college student Arica Kincheloe lost the jobs that she relied on to pay her tuition at the University of Chicago. While many schools have shifted to online classes, students remain burdened with the same tuition costs that many of them already struggled to pay.

At the end of March, Congress passed the CARES Act, providing for a $1,200 stimulus payment to most Americans. It is clear that this one-time stimulus is not enough to meet Americans’ needs. We must establish monthly payments and we must increase the amount of money received to help people like Magdalena and Arica make ends meet for the length of the COVID-19 crisis.

The economic impact of the crisis have been especially bad for people of color who are disproportionately risking their lives in jobs that cannot be done remotely. More than half of African Americans under 45 have lost their jobs or seen a reduction in work and wages since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Young people, early in their careers and often lacking seniority and the job protections of earlier generations, also are severely affected.

While the new unemployment benefits Congress passed in the first CARES Act are beginning to give millions of people a needed financial boost, we must do more to help Illinois families.

Even before the current pandemic, 40% of Americans were one missed paycheck away from disaster. No one should ever be one crisis away from poverty, but for a large percentage of American families, that is the reality. We are seeing the impact of this economic vulnerability play out over and over again as our nation struggles through these challenging times.

The fastest and most effective way to help the families in Illinois harmed by economic impacts of COVID-19 is with direct cash payments. Millions of people in Illinois have already received their one-time $1,200 CARES Act stimulus check. For many, this stimulus is a lifeline, allowing residents to pay bills that they’ve lost sleep over or to purchase groceries, replenishing cabinets that were looking increasingly bare. $1,200 is a good start, but it’s not nearly enough. The average rent for an apartment in Chicago is nearly $2,000 per month. The $1,200 stimulus wouldn’t even cover one month of rent for most families.

We need bigger, bolder policies to help people — recurring payments that last until the economy recovers and it is safe to return to work. My colleagues and I are pushing for legislation that would establish payments of $2,000 a month for adults and $1,000 for children. These payments would include college students and other adult dependents, and families with one or more members who file taxes using an Individual Tax Identification Number.

We know that the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be felt for years to come. Many are predicting the crisis will last well into 2021, or beyond. Now is not the time for timid solutions. We must take the steps necessary to not only keep our small businesses afloat, but also to keep our families afloat.

Direct payments are an essential tool to help families solve their own problems and to provide resiliency and stability. In the next relief bill, we must step up and ensure that there are no more one-time, Band-Aid solutions for families. Let’s make sure that Illinois families receive monthly payments to give them the financial security they need to ride out this crisis.

1465,819,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254960/facebook-ai-moderation-covid-19-coronavirus-hateful-memes-hate-speech,2020-05-12,How Facebook is using AI to combat COVID-19 misinformation and detect ‘hateful memes’,"Facebook on Monday released a new report detailing how it uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human fact-checkers and moderators to enforce its community standards. The report — called the Community Standards Enforcement Report, which usually encompasses data and findings from the prior three to six months — has a large focus on AI this time around and the progress Facebook is relying more on software instead of people, given the extreme toll the job can take on human moderators.

Facebook is also relying more on the technology nowadays to help moderate its platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is preventing the company from using its usual third-party moderator firms because those firms’ employees are not allowed to access sensitive Facebook data from home computers. The Verge reported on Tuesday that Facebook has settled a $52 million class action with current and former moderators to compensate them for mental health issues, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, developed while on the job. The Verge has reported extensively on the working conditions of firms Facebook hires to moderate its platform.

Every content moderator who worked for Facebook from 2015 until now will get at least $1,000, and is eligible for up to $50,000 in damages.



It's a landmark settlement that fully acknowledges the terrible toll that moderation can on the people who do this work — Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) May 12, 2020

Facebook says the data it’s compiled its most recent report doesn’t contain any larger trends in its enforcement or in offending behavior on its platform because the pandemic hit so late in its reporting period. “This report includes data only through March 2020 so it does not reflect the full impact of the changes we made during the pandemic,” writes Guy Rosen, the company’s vice president of integrity, in a blog post. “We anticipate we’ll see the impact of those changes in our next report, and possibly beyond, and we will be transparent about them.’

Given the state of the world, Facebook’s report does contain new information about how the company is specifically combating coronavirus-related misinformation and other forms of platform abuse, like price gouging on Facebook Marketplace, using its AI tools.

Facebook put warning labels on 50 million coronavirus-related posts last month

“During the month of April, we put warning labels on about 50 million posts related to COVID-19 on Facebook, based on around 7,500 articles by our independent fact-checking partners,” the company said in a separate blog post, penned by a group of its research scientists and software engineers, about its ongoing COVID-19 misinformation efforts published today. “Since March 1st, we’ve removed more than 2.5 million pieces of content for the sale of masks, hand sanitizers, surface disinfecting wipes and COVID-19 test kits. But these are difficult challenges, and our tools are far from perfect. Furthermore, the adversarial nature of these challenges means the work will never be done.”

Facebook says its labels are working: 95 percent of the time, someone who is warned that a piece of content contains misinformation will decide not to view it anyway. But producing those labels across its enormous platform is proving to be a challenge. For one, Facebook is discovering that a fair amount of misinformation as well as hate speech is now showing up in images and videos, not just text or article links.

“We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos,” the company says in a separate hate speech-specific blog post about its recent moderation findings and research. “As with other content, hate speech also can be multimodal: A meme might use text and image together to attack a particular group of people, for example.”

This is a tougher challenge for AI to tackle, the company admits. Not only do AI-trained models have a harder time parsing a meme image or a video due to complexities like wordplay and language differences, but that software must also then be trained to find duplicates or only marginally modified versions of that content as it spreads across Facebook. But this is precisely what Facebook says it’s achieved with what it calls SimSearchNet, a multiyear effort across many divisions within the company to train an AI model how to recognize both copies of the original image and those that are near-duplicates and have perhaps one word in the line of text changed.

“We have found that a substantial percentage of hate speech on Facebook globally occurs in photos or videos.”

“Once independent fact-checkers have determined that an image contains misleading or false claims about coronavirus, SimSearchNet, as part of our end-to-end image indexing and matching system, is able to recognize near-duplicate matches so we can apply warning labels,” the company says. “This system runs on every image uploaded to Instagram and Facebook and checks against task-specific human-curated databases. This accounts for billions of images being checked per day, including against databases set up to detect COVID-19 misinformation.”

Facebook uses the example of a misleading image modeled after a broadcast news graphic with a line of overlaid text reading, “COVID-19 is found in toilet paper.” The image is from a known peddler of fake news called Now8News, and the graphic has since been debunked by Snopes and other fact-checking organizations. But Facebook says it had to train its AI to differentiate between the original image and a modified one that says, “COVID-19 isn’t found in toilet paper.”

The goal is to help reduce the spread of duplicate images while also not inadvertently labeling genuine posts or those that don’t meet the bar for misinformation. This is a big problem on Facebook where many politically motivated pages and organizations or those that simply feed off partisan outrage will take photographs, screenshots, and other images and alter them to change their meaning. An AI model that knows the difference and can label one as misinformation and the other as genuine is a meaningful step forward, especially when it can then do the same to any duplicate or near-duplicate content in the future without roping in non-offending images in the process.

“It’s extremely important that these similarity systems be as accurate as possible, because a mistake can mean taking action on content that doesn’t actually violate our policies,” the company says. “This is particularly important because for each piece of misinformation fact-checker identifies, there may be thousands or millions of copies. Using AI to detect these matches also enables our fact-checking partners to focus on catching new instances of misinformation rather than near-identical variations of content they’ve already seen.”

Facebook has also improved its hate speech moderation using many of the same techniques it’s employing toward coronavirus-related content. “AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove, up from 80.2 percent the previous quarter,” the company says. “In the first quarter of 2020, we took action on 9.6 million pieces of content for violating our hate speech policies — an increase of 3.9 million.”

Facebook is able to rely more on AI, thanks to some advancements in how its models understand and parse text, both as it appears in posts and accompanying links and as overlaid in images or video.

“AI now proactively detects 88.8 percent of the hate speech content we remove.”

“People sharing hate speech often try to elude detection by modifying their content. This sort of adversarial behavior ranges from intentionally misspelling words or avoiding certain phrases to modifying images and videos,” the company says. “As we improve our systems to address these challenges, it’s crucial to get it right. Mistakenly classifying content as hate speech can mean preventing people from expressing themselves and engaging with others.” Facebook says so-called counterspeech, or a response to hate speech that argues against it but nonetheless usually contains snippets of the offensive content, is “particularly challenging to classify correctly because it can look so similar to the hate speech itself.”

Facebook’s latest report includes more data from Instagram, including how much bullying content that platform removes and how much of the content is appealed and reinstated. It applied its image-matching efforts toward finding suicide and self-injury posts, raising the percentage of Instagram content that was removed before users reported it.

Suicide and self-injury enforcement on Facebook also expanded in the last quarter of 2019, when the company removed 5 million pieces of content — double the amount it had removed in the months before. A spokesperson says this spike stemmed from a change that let Facebook detect and remove lots of very old content in October and November, and the numbers dropped dramatically in 2020 as it shifted its focus back to newer material.

Facebook says its new advances — in particular, a neural network it calls XLM-R announced last November — are helping its automated moderation systems better understand text across multiple languages. Facebook says XLM-R allows it “to train efficiently on orders of magnitude more data and for a longer amount of time,” and to transfer that learning across multiple languages.

But Facebook says memes are proving to be a resilient and hard-to-detect delivery mechanism for hate speech, even with its improved tools. So it built a dedicated “hateful meme” data set containing 10,000 examples, where the meaning of the image can only be fully understood by processing both the image and the text and understanding the relationship between the two.

An example is an image of a barren desert with the text, “Look how many people love you,” overlaid on top. Facebook calls the process of detecting this with automated systems multimodal understanding, and training its AI models with this level of sophistication is part of its more cutting-edge moderation research.

“To provide researchers with a data set with clear licensing terms, we licensed assets from Getty Images. We worked with trained third-party annotators to create new memes similar to existing ones that had been shared on social media sites,” the company says. “The annotators used Getty Images’ collection of stock images to replace the original visuals while still preserving the semantic content.”

Facebook says it’s providing the data set to researchers to improve techniques for detecting this type of hate speech online. It’s also launching a challenge with a $100,000 prize for researchers to create models trained on the data set that can successfully parse these more subtle forms of speech that Facebook is seeing more often now that its systems are more proactively taking down more blatant hateful content.

Their puzzle game challenges scientists as well as students and the public alike to build a protein that can block the virus from infiltrating human cells. This puzzle game is on Foldit, which is a 12 year old website created by the university’s Center for Game Science that was designed to crowdsource contributions to important protein research from over 200,000 registered players.

According to the University the most promising ideas that are generated from the game will be tested and possibly be manufactured by UW’s Institute for Protein Design in Seattle.

COVID-19 is short for Coronavirus disease 2019, and it is spreading around the globe infecting thousands of people and accumulating an increasing death toll as it moves. The title of coronavirus is not limited to this single virus rather a class of viruses that includes the common cold as well as SARS that have crown shaped spikes of protein on top. However, the symptoms of COVID-19 are on a level far more serious than what is seen in cold sufferers.

Coronaviruses spread when the spike of proteins on their surface bind tightly to receptor proteins found on human cells, when this occurs the virus can infect human cells and replicate. 90% of the cases thus far appear to be confirmed in China according to a tracker created by Johns Hopkins University, although an increasing amount of cases are emerging in Europe and America.

“In recent weeks, researchers have determined the structure of the 2019 coronavirus spike protein and how it binds to human receptors,” according to the puzzle description. “If we can design a protein that binds to this coronavirus spike protein, it could be used to block the interaction with human cells and halt infection!”

To assist in containment efforts even the tech world is taking serious precautions to avoid further spread of the deadly virus as such the giants Google and Amazon are restricting employee travel; and big tech conferences including Facebook’s F8, the Mobile World Congress, and the Game Developers Conference have either been cancelled or postponed.

So for any that would like to contact or take a shot at playing the game and finding a cure the next time it is opened please feel free to click here and watch for the opening on Foldit to help design an antiviral protein against COVID-19, and good luck to you all.",fake

The layoffs, which were first reported by TechCrunch, are the first major staff cuts by a scooter startup since the pandemic first hit — but they are likely not to be the last.

The news comes after most of the major scooter sharing startups have said they would reduce or eliminate service in most major markets in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a memo from Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden published by TechCrunch, the layoffs were needed to ensure the company stays solvent until the end of 2021.

the layoffs were needed to ensure Bird stays solvent until the end of 2021

Laid off employees will be provided four weeks of pay, three months of health coverage, and an extra 12 months to exercise their stock options, TechCrunch reports.

With “shelter-in-place” orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home and avoiding unnecessary travel, scooter companies are seeing a steep drop in sales and demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a unique challenge for the money-losing scooter industry that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm.

The pandemic notwithstanding, no startup has yet figured out how to earn a profit without relying on tens of millions of dollars in venture capital investment.

Bird’s main rival, Lime, is likely also considering worker reductions. The San Francisco-based company laid off 14 percent of its workforce last January and exited 12 markets, and a recent report in Bloomberg suggested that Lime is close to eliminating up to 70 more positions in response to the coronavirus.

1484,903,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/faucis_song_and_dance.html,2020-05-14,Fauci's Song and Dance,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has never been muzzled by President Trump, as the lamestream media often charged, but maybe he should have been and should be still. Before his tour de farce before the Senate Health Committee, the shy, modest, and unassuming Dr. Fauci emailed a New York Times reporter with a preview of his testimony, an apocalypse now prediction if we don’t hang on to and follow his sage and expert advice:

Dr. Anthony Fauci emailed New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg Monday night with a preview of his message for a Senate hearing on Tuesday in which he warns of “needless suffering and death” if the country opens “prematurely” from the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus lockdowns… Stolberg posted Fauci’s message to Twitter: “The major message that I wish to convey to the Senate HLP committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the country prematurely. If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: ‘Open America Again,’ then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”

Or we could just sit here and wait for a vaccine that may or may not come and may or may not work while our economy atrophies and people turn to drugs, alcohol, child abuse, domestic violence and even suicide as their nest eggs dreams, livelihoods evaporates. Many would argue, and I count myself among them, that Fauci’s consistently wrong advice using consistently wrong computer models has led to needless suffering and death.

Tucker Carlson on his Fox News show recently asked Dr. Marty Makary, professor of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. what he thought of Fauci’s performance thus far and his assessment was not good:

He's a good laboratory virologist. But you know, in terms of preparing this country, he missed it… For two months from January 15th when we had our first case confirmed walking around in the United States on U.S. oil until March 15th, with the country latching on to every word he says, he never once prepared this country with anything beyond simple hygiene and basic virology lessons. He went on the media every day, on every show. Never once did we hear, let's get ready with more PPE. Let's build up our stockpiles. Let's stop nonessential travel. Let's get more swabs. Let's build up capacity with reagents and testing. So, that was a big miss, and I don't know whether or not to blame him because we all make mistakes, or the entire country putting their faith and stock in one doctor.

Ouch. His pronouncements have been dangerously and consistently inaccurate, as when he asserted that the coronavirus was nothing to worry about and we should just get on with our lives. As The Hill reported on January 26::

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said Sunday the American public shouldn’t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China. “It’s a very, very low risk to the United States,” Fauci said during an interview with radio show host John Catsimatidis. “But it’s something that we as public health officials need to take very seriously... It isn’t something the American public needs to worry about or be frightened about.”

Or how about his sage advice on masks and the now-you-need-them now-you-don’t flip-flop on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on March 8:

When it comes to preventing coronavirus, public health officials have been clear: Healthy people do not need to wear a face mask to protect themselves from COVID-19. ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told 60 Minutes. While masks may block some droplets, Fauci said, they do not provide the level of protection people think they do. Wearing a mask may also have unintended consequences: People who wear masks tend to touch their face more often to adjust them, which can spread germs from their hands.

Coronavirus was nothing to worry about. There was no need to wear face masks. Fauci has been the Pied Piper of economic and medical misinformation. After he changed his mind and decided that we needed to shut down the world’s greatest and booming economy, he did so on the basis of bogus models.

First Fauci and Birx used the discredited Ferguson model to persuade Trump to lock down the economy. A New York Times reporter wrote on how apocalyptic nonsense from researcher Neil Ferguson and the Imperial College was used to dupe the White House Coronavirus Task Force and influence President Trump to accept Fauci’s draconian lockdown:

Sweeping new federal recommendations announced on Monday for Americans to sharply limit their activities appeared to draw on a dire scientific report warning that, without action by the government and individuals to slow the spread of coronavirus and suppress new cases, 2.2 million people in the United States could die. To curb the epidemic, there would need to be drastic restrictions on work, school and social gatherings for periods of time until a vaccine was available, which could take 18 months, according to the report, compiled by British researchers… …Asked at a news conference with President Trump about what had led to the change in thinking by a White House task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the task force leaders, said new information had come from a model developed in Britain.

We are trapped in this suicidal national lockdown because Fauci relied on and believed a report from the same doofus who in 2005 predicted that as many as 200 million people would die from the bird flu and in 2009 that British deaths from the swine flu would number 500,000 annually. Deaths numbered 500.

Even Fauci must have realized the absurdities of such numbers, for he soon turned to another model from the University of Washington. But that model’s projections on cases and deaths changed enormously and frequently as new data came in, making accurate projections unreliable. Even Fauci noted:

“As we’re getting more data and seeing the positive of effect of mitigation, those numbers are going to be downgraded, as you’ve said,” Dr. Fauci said on Fox News. “I don’t know exactly what the numbers are going to be, but right now it looks like it’s going to be less than the original projection.”

In an article in the Washington Post quoting Dr. Fauci on computer models, he said

…there are too many variables at play in the pandemic to make the models reliable: “I’ve looked at all the models. I’ve spent a lot of time on the models. They don’t tell you anything. You can’t really rely upon models.”

Who elected Dr. Fauci President? Fauci keeps moving the goalposts. First COVID was not a threat. Then it was. We didn't need masks. Then we did. This is Lucy holding the football for Charlie Brown. Now he tells us we have to wait for a vaccine for his permission to educate our children, worship our God, or visit our doctor?

Home of the brave and land of the free? Thanks to Fauci, we empty our jails so we have room for nail and hair salon owners wanting to feed their children. Fauci warns of needless suffering and death from a premature reopening of the economy he shut down. We are already miserable and dying.

We are dying from conditions not being treated because the hospitals and doctors are limited to so-called essential treatments and services. We are dying from suicide and depression and hopelessness in an atrophied economy. We are dying from vanished nest eggs, retirement plans, and dreams. We are dying from jobs that will never come back and businesses that will never reopen

We are dying in an economy whose upward curve your advice has flattened. You have destroyed the American dream almost singlehandedly and done what no foreign adversary ever could -- brought America to its knees.

Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul rightly took Dr. Fauci apart for his apocalyptic Senate testimony:

“If we keep kids out of school for another year, what’s going to happen is the poor and underprivileged kids who don’t have a parent that’s able to teach them at home are not going to learn for a full year,” Paul said. Paul rebuked Fauci, saying: “I don’t think you’re the end-all. I don’t think you’re the one person who gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there’s not going to be a surge and that we can safely open the economy.”

I don’t think he’s the end-all either. To Dr. Fauci the U.S. is one big clinical trial and we are lab rats in his experiment. As America dies from bureaucratic asphyxiation, it's time we got a second opinion

J.B. Pritzker presented a blueprint for reopening the state, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Thursday unveiled her plans for what the county’s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic will look like.

The “Cook County COVID-19 Response Plan: From Rapid Response to Equitable Recovery,” includes a Council on Digital Equity, which will oversee the county’s efforts to help bridge the digital divide for more than a quarter of county residents who lack high-speed internet or enough bandwidth to manage Zoom classes or handle other online tasks, Preckwinkle said in a livestreamed appearance before the City Club of Chicago.

The county is also launching a new open-learning platform in collaboration with the University of Chicago’s Office of Civic Engagement to provide six weeks of lectures for residents.

The county is moving ahead with its fair transit project, despite the pandemic causing transit ridership to fall.

That project, which was unveiled last year, continues the work of the county’s Department of Transportation and Highways with regional partners Metra, Pace and the CTA to bring “affordable, accessible transit” to more riders on the South Side of Chicago and in the south and southwest suburbs.

The CTA has not agreed yet to participate, but the county is in negotiations with Metra and hopes for a fall rollout.

The plan also includes a community advisory council composed of community leaders and advocates who are being recruited from across the county. They are to provide feedback from their communities on the effectiveness of the county’s plan and on existing gaps in services and explore potential areas for partnership with the county, the board president said. She hopes the council can begin meeting near the end of the month.

Cook County surpassed Queens, N.Y., as the county with most COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Thursday. Cook County, which has a population of 5.1 million, added 2,051 cases in the last 24 hours compared to 336 for the New York county, which has 2.25 million people.

Preckwinkle said the focus of the plan is on communities because the county has a “moral obligation to focus on equity as well” in its recovery efforts, which “must include everyone,” especially black and brown communities that have been “hit the hardest.”

“These initiatives address the root causes of inequity, including our community partners and residents and ensure that when Cook County recovers from this crisis, we will recover together,” Preckwinkle said. “Our recovery will encompass everyone, not just those who have the access to the most resources.”

The county’s response to the virus could change over the next two years as researchers work on developing a vaccine. Bill Barnes, the head of the county’s Emergency Management and Regional Security department, said the pandemic’s effect will “ebb and flow.”

“This is not a typical disaster where, say, a tornado strikes, and response is going in rescuing people, cleaning up debris and then transitioning to a clean recovery period where it’s rebuilding and restoring services,” Barnes said. “Here, we anticipate several waves of infections which are going to mean that we’re going to have to ramp up and down our recovery to respond to the situation on the ground. Simultaneously, there are going to be recovery actions because we can’t wait to begin the recovery actions until this is over, two years from now.”

Dr. Kiran Joshi, a co-director of the county’s Department of Public Health, said as cases decrease the county will step up its contact tracing efforts, which the county is planning for now.",real
1495,534,https://curiousmindmagazine.com/the-most-important-advice-for-parents-to-encourage-math-in-children-amid-lockdown/,2020-04-30,The Most Important Advice for Parents to Encourage Math in Children Amid Lockdown,"Not every child is born with skills to solve math equations and divide and multiply swiftly. Most of them struggle with calculations, algebra, and graphs. And the approach most parents take in pushing them toward the ability is through destructive and degrading feedback. Yes, math is an essential part of the world, and without this basic skill, no person can succeed in life. But there are better ways of infusing this mindset in children than by force.

Administering the latest situation of complete or partial lockdown in all coronavirus infected countries, with no sign of educational institutes reopening, you as a parent may be more than ever worried about the math education of your children. Teachers and school administrations are doing their best with video lectures, but the engagement and productive factors are lessened.

In a time like this, the best thing you can do is take it upon yourself to give your child the math education they truly need. This can be done by showing them real-life examples of math problems. Most kids aren’t good at math because they don’t understand how it works and aren’t able to apply it in everyday life.

In addition to including real-life problems, you can make use of the internet by downloading highly interactive math puzzles, math educating games and apps, fun math videos, and more. Take out the board games that have been eating dust in your attic to play with your kids, as several of them are related to math problem-solving. Or make games by yourself using cutout numbers and math symbols for kids to learn and have fun.",fake

Healight Platform Technology has been exclusively licensed to Aytu BioScience Inc for worldwide commercial development and release which could mean that hospitals around the globe may soon adopt this approach.

According to some reports this method has been billed as being a potential “first-in-class treatment for coronavirus and other respiratory infections,” that utilizes proprietary methods of administering intermittent UVA light using a novel endotracheal device. Preclinical study findings are suggesting that this approach has the potential to help eradicate the spread of this COVID-19 outbreak, as well as “a wide range of viruses and bacteria, inclusive of coronavirus.”

A team from the Medically Associated Science and Technology Program at Cedars-Sinai led by Dr. Mark Pimental, MD have been developing Healight since 2016, and it has a growing body of evidence demonstrating its efficacy as both an antiviral and an antibacterial treatment.

There have been rumors of talks with the FDA about the development of a near term path that could enable early use of this technology to help the COVID-19 patients who are suffering in ICUs, and it may also be useful in treating ventilator associated pneumonia, or VAP.

""Our team has shown that administering a specific spectrum of UV-A light can eradicate viruses in infected human cells (including coronavirus) and bacteria in the area while preserving healthy cells,"" stated Dr. Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai. Ali Rezaie, MD, one of the inventors of this technology states, ""Our lab at Cedars-Sinai has extensively studied the effects of this unique technology on bacteria and viruses. Based on our findings we believe this therapeutic approach has the potential to significantly impact the high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus-infected patients and patients infected with other respiratory pathogens. We are looking forward to partnering with Aytu BioScience to move this technology forward for the benefit of patients all over the world.""

The FDA, Aytu, and Cedars-Sinai are rumored to be working together towards developing a plan for the expedited regulatory approval of Healight to be used against the continued battle against the global COVID-19 outbreak. Those critical ill with this virus may benefit from use of this minimally invasive treatment approach.

Around the globe many hospitals are already using UV light to help clean surfaces and disinfect rooms where COVID-19 patients have been treated, extending the use of such technology to the direct treatment of the virus in patients would appear to be the next logical step.

Natural UV light from the sun appears to be able to destroy most harmful bacteria on the skin as well as viruses and other microbes, similar benefit could also potentially be gained from using artificial UV rays generated by medical devices, and this is what Aytu and Cedars-Sinai are hoping will be widely implemented around the globe.

“We are honored to be partnering with Cedars-Sinai as we believe the Healight therapeutic platform has the potential to help many patients during this coronavirus pandemic and beyond.This first-in-class technology has the potential to be a game changer for clinicians treating patients infected with coronavirus and other respiratory conditions, and our team is working tirelessly alongside the Cedars-Sinai team to determine the safety and effectiveness of this device in humans,” says Josh Disbrow, Chairman and CEO of Aytu BioScience.",fake
1498,798,https://slate.com/technology/2020/05/airlines-flying-after-coronavirus.html,2020-05-12,What Will Air Travel Look Like After the Pandemic?,"Grounded planes at Brisbane Airport on April 21 in Brisbane, Australia Jono Searle/Getty Images

America is grounded on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. Photos of thousands of airliners crammed onto unused runways and any available tarmac space take place in our national lockdown’s gallery of eerie images. Domestic passenger traffic numbers are down about 95 percent from a year earlier. Airlines have canceled most flights as they lose tens of millions of dollars a day, and there is little indication that demand for air travel will pick up anytime soon. The federal government did step in to provide the industry with $25 billion in emergency grants and loans to preserve the nation’s circulatory system and prevent a total collapse—aid conditioned upon the airlines continuing to serve all their domestic markets and avoiding any layoffs until September.

Against this backdrop, Future Tense editorial director Andrés Martinez invited three aviation experts to talk on Slack about when, and how, Americans might take flight again. Seth Kaplan is the transportation analyst for NPR’s Here & Now, the author of Glory Lost and Found: How Delta Climbed From Despair to Dominance in the Post-9/11 Era , and co-host of the Airlines Confidential podcast.* Benét Wilson is the credit card editor for the Points Guy. She’s a veteran aviation journalist who has written for such publications as USA Today and Aviation Daily and is known among her peers as the aviation queen. Christopher Schaberg is the Dorothy Harrell Brown distinguished professor of English at Loyola University–New Orleans and the author of The End of Airports.

On May 21 at 4 p.m. Eastern, Future Tense will host an online event asking, “Will We Ever Fly Again?” RSVP now.

Andrés Martinez: Seth, let me start with you on an, um, easy question: When do you think we will get back to 2019 levels (or those of January, for that matter, when we saw a 5 percent increase in passenger traffic of air travel)?

Seth Kaplan: We’ve never seen anything like this. In fact, not only is this worse than each of the prior crises (9/11, SARS, the Great Recession, etc.)—it’s worse than all of them combined. The answer to when we will return to something resembling normal really depends on the course of the pandemic itself, when there will be a vaccine, etc. If you could tell me the answer to that, I could tell you what will happen with aviation. But it’s difficult to imagine a nearly normal year before 2022, if not 2023.

Benét Wilson: Another big thing is airlines winning the trust of travelers by ensuring that planes are clean enough and there are enough proper social distancing protocols in place, from the time people enter the airport to the time they’re on board in their seats. That’s going to be a challenge.

Christopher Schaberg: Yes, Benét has hit on a key issue: There’s public health, and then there’s personal risk. Both of these collide intensely at airports and on airplanes.

Andrés: In recent years, we all entered into a pact with airlines: Cram however many of us as you need to onto the back of those planes to keep fares low. That’s been the basis of the democratization of flight (though we still complain about being crammed in). Benét, is the current crisis going to result in the end of that bargain? Do you think we are going to see flying again become an elite pursuit, with lowest fares to fly across the country starting at a couple grand to accommodate social distancing concerns? Or will all this pass?

Benét: I’m old enough to have flown regularly on airlines in the pre-deregulation age. My father was an Air Force officer, and we traveled the world back then, when air travel was mostly for the rich. I can envision a scenario where fares will go up, making air travel less accessible. Airlines need to keep butts in seats and their balance books in the black. Frontier had to walk back charging travelers for an empty middle seat. But when you squeeze, that toothpaste is coming out, one way or another.

Andrés: Chris, you recently wrote a moving ode to empty airports. We always assumed there was an inevitability about the continued expansion of travel and shrinking of the world. But did your ruminations about empty airports make you—should they make us—question those assumptions?

Christopher: The unknowns right now are so wildly beyond anyone’s calculations or control. It’s hard to say. But we are now realizing just how much faith we had—for so long!—in the “ongoingness” of air travel basically as a static enterprise. Now we’re suddenly faced with a wide range of possibilities, from back to the status quo on the one side to a near-total wind-down of commercial flight on the other. And it really seems like anything in between could occur.

I think we may have reached—or even crossed—a threshold of growth that is (and has been, frankly) unsustainable. For several decades it seemed like unlimited growth was entirely possible and inevitable (speaking of commercial flight specifically, here), and now we’re having to reassess the assumptions that made such growth believable and possible. It’s hard for me to see how we’ll simply return to the level of flights from a few months ago—and keep growing—because COVID-19 has given a jolt to the system—a jolt that is also connected (if not directly) to broader environmental issues surrounding flight, which are not going away but are only foregrounded now with cleaner and quieter skies, etc.

Andrés: True, flight shaming due to climate was starting to be a bit of a thing pre-pandemic, especially in Europe. Seth, do you think airlines have been worried about this environmental concern as a long-term threat to their business?

Seth: It had certainly moved from the back of their minds to the forefront. An existential threat? I don’t think most of them considered it that. But a long-term threat to one degree or another? Absolutely. Until Greta Thunberg’s journey, I don’t think very many people viewed global travel by air as anything other than aspirational—a force for good. If it’s becoming socially unacceptable among any meaningful number of people—something to be ashamed of—that’s unhelpful for airlines. It’s a question of degree, and I think the best bet now is a measurable but not overwhelming avoidance of flying by some people.

Christopher: It seems like we’ve kind of moved from flight shame to flight fear, but these two things might become increasingly conflated—and equally existentially dangerous for airlines.

Benét: Last week I drove from Baltimore to my family home in San Antonio. I dropped off the car at San Antonio International Airport and looked at everything with the coronavirus lens. Will I use those water bottle fill stations? How will we social distance at TSA checkpoints? How will bins and checkpoint areas be cleaned? How will eateries and retail handle passengers? So many questions that need to be answered.

Andrés: You brought up the Frontier Airlines episode from this week. They wanted to charge passengers $39 to block middle seats; there was an outcry; they backtracked. That reminded me of an interesting story Richard Aboulafia wrote for Future Tense on how the industry has always had an unwritten rule that thou shalt not compete on safety grounds. But in a pandemic environment, it’s going to be hard to distinguish between marketing for comfort and for safety. Is that business class pod just a way to get a nice sleep on your way to London or a means of preserving your life?

Benét: I’m looking at that JetBlue Mint seat with the door I flew on in a whole new light. Same with other airlines that have pods. I feel sorry for the airlines having to walk that fine line between comfort and safety. I fear there will be a few more stumbles of this sort before we settle into a new normal.

Seth: What’s interesting is that a few airlines around the world have, for several years, allowed customers to bid to be seated next to any empty seats, and of course there was no outcry when it was only a question of comfort, not hoping to avoid a deadly virus. Now, granted, the middle seat on Frontier is only 18 inches wide, not 6 feet, so it’s reasonable to say it’s selling only a false sense of security, not true security, anyway. But to Aboulafia’s point, if it had already been offering to block middle seats for $39 prior to all this, that would be different. To the larger point: Decades ago, if you asked fliers what they cared about when they chose an airline, they would mention safety alongside price and schedule. In recent years, they wouldn’t, not because they didn’t care about safety but because they took for granted that all airlines were basically quite safe. Now we see airlines sort of competing, however cordially, for which one provides the most social distance in an environment not designed for social distancing. At some point, maybe after there’s a vaccine, that will start to fade again as a marketing tool, so to speak, but just the fact that we’re there, however temporarily it might be, is remarkable.

Andrés: Beyond the issue of fares needing to match supply and demand, which we alluded to above, do you guys think this crisis will accelerate other trends we were already seeing in aviation?

Seth: I think consolidation is somewhat back in play, because regulators are more likely to approve a merger or acquisition if companies can argue that absent it, one company (if not both) would go out of business anyway. U.S. airlines couldn’t, with a straight face, in recent years, claim to face any existential threats. Now they can. I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but it’s more likely because of that.

Christopher: It seems like one thing we could see (this is a bit dystopian, perhaps), is a stark two-cabin model where $$$ first-class seats have even more space between them, and then in back (after a severe dividing wall) there are the standing chairs (remember those?) for steerage. This probably won’t happen, but I’ll bet at least one airline is looking into it.

Benét: I remember how airlines pulled back on free meals after 9/11, going toward a buy- on-board model. We’re already seeing airlines taking away that option, along with alcohol too.

Seth: Yes, I think we can forget about some of the modest amenities U.S. airlines have restored in economy in recent years. The stroopwafels might have gone away on health grounds (to minimize nonessential interactions between flight attendants and customers), but I don’t think they’ll come back the moment it’s safe. These airlines are back to trying to get through the day, focusing on needs and not wants.

Andrés: I do miss those stroopwafels, United’s great innovation of the past decade.

Christopher: I too remember after 9/11 when all that free food went away. I was working at an airport at the time and used to live on all the extra boxed meals we’d unload at the end of the day. Then, suddenly, they were just gone.

Andrés: To Seth’s earlier point, we take for granted now how safe flying really has been. … We can reasonably assume planes don’t fall out of the air. But occasionally other concerns pop up, such as terrorism post- 9/11, which led to the creation of TSA, the end of being able to meet loved ones at gates, the ritual of taking off shoes and dispensing with liquids at security. Now our safety concerns are shifting and I see TSA relaxing liquids rules and allowing expired driver’s licenses to go through! (Imagine that on 9/12!)

Christopher: I know, all those new 12-ounce bottles of hand sanitizer let through! Really?!?

Seth: Every crisis changes the industry, so it’s reasonable to think the biggest crisis will change the industry in big ways. But typically, there’s an (understandably) big reaction to a crisis, and then things get ratcheted back. Flying became a lot more of a hassle after 9/11, but eventually we got PreCheck and so forth.

Christopher: Or it’s possible that all the empty planes flying overhead right now will be seen as the most ridiculous last grasp at keeping this enterprise called commercial flight alive.

Andrés: So I want to pin you guys down a bit more. It’s 2030 … what is it like to fly? Don’t answer, “It depends on the pandemic.”

Benét: I must resist the temptation to predict we’ll all be in those flying cars we’ve been waiting for since the 1950s …

Seth: I’ll start with an easy one: We are all becoming permanently more germophobic, and we will forever see some number of people, even if just a few, wearing masks on flights—including just domestic flights in the U.S.—even after there’s a vaccine and there’s no specific, immediate threat.

Christopher: I have a hope: that in 2030 commercial flight takes place at a fraction of what 2019’s levels were and people understand that flying is for special, “essential” travel. And airlines have adjusted and contracted to meet this demand. But the more cynical side of me thinks that in 2030 it will look a lot like 2019 but even worse, and yet climate change and other environmental disasters will be making life harder for those living in the poorest nations and hardest parts of the world.

Andrés: You don’t believe it’s beneficial travel has become more accessible and commonplace in recent years?

Christopher: The accessibility of flight was beneficial, to a point—but then it metastasized so quickly.

Andrés: The real explosion in traffic has been overseas, with the rise of the global middle class. Isn’t it hard to tell people elsewhere they can’t enjoy our way of life because they are late to the party?

Christopher: It is a real tension, for sure. But the “party” metaphor is apt: The party can only go on for so long before everyone is throwing up.

Seth: This is why many people feel a true global price on carbon, which includes aviation, is the way forward. The idea is, you let people make their own choices, but pricing in the impact of those choices.

Benét: I see a global contraction, with a governmental organization overseeing the airline industry as the Civil [Aeronautics] Board once did.

It will regulate fleets and schedules, eliminating competition. Fares will be higher, and not everyone will be able to afford to fly. But it will insulate the industry from future chaos, where Sir Richard Branson is offering Necker Island as collateral to save Virgin Atlantic and the Italian government has swooped in to nationalize Alitalia.

Seth: I hesitate to disagree with the Aviation Queen (being that I’m not even a prince), but I expect more incremental change than what Benét said.

Andrés: Seth, if you have enough frequent flyer points, we can upgrade you to Aviation Czar.

Benét: It’s all good. I was looking way into the future—and who will check me in 2030?

Seth: Absent some big, unimaginable, external force—which we’ve all seen is a dangerous game to play, to try to ignore that!—I think we know a lot of what will happen, because airports and airplanes are designed with such longtime horizons. We know, more or less, what kinds of airplanes airlines will be flying in 2030, and they’re not so different from the ones they’re flying today. They’ll be more carbon-friendly—that’s good—but if their efficiency means less money spent on fuel, the benefits of that could flow more to consumers than to the environment (if flying continues becoming cheaper and thus more people do it). The pace of “densification,” as airlines call it— ramming more seats on planes—will actually slow, even absent any COVID-related sensitivities, because many airlines are up against the regulatory limits of how many seats you can put on an airplane.

Andrés: It’s so interesting … to think about the clamor for de-densification that will be such a staple of life, right? On planes, and elsewhere.

Seth: Definitely.

Andrés: I mean, no offense, but I don’t want to get on an elevator with any of you.

Seth: A full dance floor used to be the sign of a great party! What are weddings going to look like now? And so forth.

Christopher: Yes, we are completely reorienting our senses of space: personal space, social space, and psychic space. And airports and airplanes are places where senses of space are felt (and monetized) intensely. There’s no marketing scheme or loyalty campaign that can really mitigate this reality. And regardless of our personal decisions, when it comes to risk, we are going to see a lot of professions reining in travel—if not directly for safety reasons, for cost-saving reasons. Because they now realize they can. People are used to Zoom and all the other telecommuting technologies.

Andrés: Benét, you may be the “Aviation Queen,” but you have a broad view of the travel ecosystem beyond airlines. Do you see demand for travel going down because of factors other than flying … such as what might happen with hotels and credit cards, and attractions like Disney World?

Benét: I just published a story on the Points Guy about my stay in a hotel last week. Think about all the surfaces and that the coronavirus can last five-plus days on. Housekeepers will have to be retrained. Rooms will take longer to clean. Rates will go up—and that’s even if you can convince guests that you’re cleaning properly. We’re already seeing credit cards—especially travel-branded ones—being forced to offer credits and allowing more points or miles per dollar spent on categories such as dining and groceries.

Andrés: Before we finish here I’d like each of you to tell me: When are you next getting on a plane, and why?

Christopher: I have no plans to fly right now. I hope to travel in the fall or spring to give a university talk that got canceled at the end of March. But that’s my only real idea or tentative plan, at this point. I’m certainly not going to rush it.

Seth: I haven’t been on a flight since January and have no current plans, other than a flight I booked for October because it was practically free (figuring I can take it or not, depending on the situation). I do hope to fly before then—just no specific plans, as I wait to see when it seems safe. The first place my family and I will go will certainly be Florida, to see our families whom we didn’t get to see over Passover (when we last planned to visit them).

Benét: I’m the Aviation Queen—and I drove from Baltimore to San Antonio, so that tells you something. I love to travel, but I don’t see myself getting on a plane before November. I’m a germophobe. (I’ve always traveled with Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer.)

Andrés: Thanks to you all. This has been fun, if sobering. I hope to meet all of you in person sometime soon—just not in a middle seat next to me.

Rather than wait, they’re getting hitched alone or with a few local loved ones looking on at a safe social distance as other guests join virtually. Then they plan to reschedule larger celebrations when allowed.

“We were about to put a $15,000 deposit down on a venue when coronavirus hit,” said Kate Whiting, 35, in Northern California’s tiny Lake Almanor Peninsula. “Why would I want to wait to marry my best friend?”

The 300-guest wedding of her dreams, and those of her 40-year-old fiance, Jake Avery, will happen once a COVID-19 vaccine is in place. For now, a close friend recently ordained will marry them in their yard June 6.

Their approach, born of necessity, is a play on micro weddings, the first choice for some couples looking for a more intimate experience or unable to afford splashier affairs.

Before the pandemic so dramatically changed lives, 20,000 to 30,000 weddings happened every weekend in the U.S., with more than 550,000 originally planned for April, May and June this year, according to data from the wedding planning site TheKnot.com.

Worldwide, 93% of couples whose weddings are impacted by the virus are rescheduling, with only 7% canceling altogether, the site said.

The average cost of weddings pre-pandemic was teetering at just under $34,000, and the average guest count at 131.

Nicole Ochoa and Brad Wilkinson, both 27, had an initial guest list of 200-plus before choosing to go micro for their July nuptials. Really, really micro. The Sonoma County, California, couple decided on fewer than a dozen guests for the wedding on a ranch near home that overlooks estate vineyards.

“We just really wanted it to be personal,” Ochoa said. “I hope that other people can pause and consider this as an option. It feels like the wedding industry and wedding trends have turned into such a show.”

Guest lists of 50 or fewer accounted for just 8 percent of U.S. weddings last year, down from 10 percent the year before, according to The Knot, which surveys more than 25,000 couples annually. Weddings with 51 to 150 guests encompassed 54 percent of couples.

Kristen Maxwell Cooper, editor in chief of The Knot, said couples who want to keep their original plans but worry that virus restrictions will drive their guest counts down might consider “shift weddings.”

Once conditions allow, she said, “They can host their ceremony with a group of 25 of their guests while live-streaming to the rest of their loved ones, followed by a reception with the same group who attended the ceremony for a few hours before the next group of guests arrive.”

With the second of three deposits due on their venue, Ochoa and Wilkinson are in the process of asking for a “force majeure” clause in their contract so they can get their money back in case virus restrictions remain in place.

“If the venue denies our request, we’ve decided to keep the date and get married in Nicole’s parent’s Sonoma County backyard,” Wilkinson said.

Ochoa added: “We would be incredibly sad if we can’t be married at the venue we fell so hard for, but there’s something pretty magical about the thought of walking across the lawn in my dress with my Dad, too.”

Vendors focused on micro weddings and organized elopements have seen an uptick in interest since the virus struck, but some couples were ahead of that curve.

Melissa Todd, 50, and Jeffrey Hall, 59, used PopTheKnot.com for their $7,000 elopement with seven guests. They married last November in Chicago, where they live, and wanted to do something quick.

“I’m just one of those people who never dreamed of a big elaborate wedding,” Todd said. “I’m pretty mellow.”

Pop the Knot makes use of downtime at venues around the country. It operates in nine cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Austin, Texas.

“We already were quite busy, but sadly we have been receiving a ton of emails from clients that had their weddings canceled due to COVID and are now wanting to do a small pop-up,” said owner and wedding planner Michele Velazquez.

SimplyEloped.com offers low-cost packages in destinations including the Florida Keys, Lake Tahoe and New Orleans.

“Since the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve had numerous couples come to me every day with similar stories: They’re canceling their big wedding due to travel complications, not wanting to assemble a big group of people or other virus-related problems,” said the site’s editor, Karen Norian.

“These couples are heartbroken, not just about the financial losses, but the thought of pushing their marriages out to some ambiguous future date is devastating,” she said.

Renee McCarthy, 33, and her husband, Ryan McCarthy, live in San Diego and wed at Temecula Creek Inn in Temecula, California, in March 2019, with 24 guests attending.

“We both wanted to focus on the guests we did have there, our families and closest friends” Renee said. “Even for a small wedding it was overwhelming trying to put it together, but we couldn’t be happier with how our wedding turned out.”",real

Our nation has a terrible disease. It goes beyond the coronavirus pandemic that has taken a human, social, and economic toll. It's in the roots of our politics.

We are so divided that not even in the midst of a world-shaking pandemic can we bridge the gap. As the country debates reopening, the lack of unity among politicians and the public portends a dangerous roadmap for future threats.

The opportunity of crisis

COVID-19 has shown a weakness in the American societal infrastructure. There were warnings about the coming health crisis, but our lack of preparedness left us exposed.

There is opportunity to learn from this pandemic, and to imagine what else is on our horizon and how to preempt it.

Bill Gates has repeatedly warned of the dangers of a natural or even man-made pandemic similar to the coronavirus. With its intentionality, bioterror could make today's pandemic look quaint.

We're at varying stages of aggression with North Korea, China, and Iran, and it's not hard to contemplate an escalation that puts our country on wartime footing.

The climate crisis demands bold measures to combat an enormous impact on our daily lives, including clean water shortages, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.

But there are two issues preventing us from effectively managing these potential threats: as of now Americans do not have the collective will and resources to prepare for the next unimaginable, and our political leaders appear to be incapable of responding in a unified way that puts country first. If the coronavirus has taught us anything, we are too divided to stop or even battle the inevitable.

Clarity in unity

Based on each state's response to the coronavirus, there's been much speculation in traditional and social media as to whether GOP- or Democrat-dominated states will be hit harder by the disease. In a more perfect union, there should be no concern about the partisan lean of those hit by the disease, but in 2020 America, there's a political side to every subject.

One light in an otherwise dark moment in government is the bipartisan relief legislation passed by Congress. But fiscal hawks — those who want to pare down our economic response for fear of the national debt — are starting to gain traction amid the one sign of comity.

A marker of our partisanship is that neither side is sufficiently comfortable criticizing its own and complimenting the other team.

Several personalities on Fox News are essentially Trump TV, which makes it the echo chamber of Red America. MSNBC and CNN, which report through a blue lens, still have the integrity to criticize their own, but the lens still screens out clarity. Across the landscape, the focus is as much on scoring political points as it is on the potential to save lives.

We've seen a few encouraging moves – for example, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham and Rep. Doug Collins criticized Governor Brian Kemp for reopening too fast. Members of both parties spoke out on some of Trump's most extreme actions – like claiming total authority over the coronavirus response or making dangerous claims about ingesting disinfectants. Some Democrats and Republicans are even praising colleagues across the aisle.

The ability to criticize one's own or find uncommon accord is refreshing, but it shouldn't be. With existential threats upon us, it is the core of our autonomy. It is the path for representatives of our democracy to bring us through crisis.",real
1515,705,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/8/21252827/roy-horn-siegfried-roy-dies-coronavirus-75,2020-05-08,Roy Horn of Siegfried & Roy dies from coronavirus at 75,"LAS VEGAS — Roy Horn of Siegfried & Roy, the duo whose extraordinary magic tricks astonished millions until Horn was critically injured in 2003 by one of the act’s famed white tigers, has died. He was 75.

Horn died of complications from the coronavirus on Friday in a Las Vegas hospital, according to a statement released by publicist Dave Kirvin.

“Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,” Siegfried Fischbacher said in the statement. “From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.”

He was injured in October 2003 when a tiger named Montecore attacked him on stage at the Mirage hotel-casino in Las Vegas. He had severe neck injuries, lost a lot of blood and later suffered a stroke. He underwent lengthy rehabilitation, but the attack ended the long-running Las Vegas Strip production.

The darker-haired of the flashy duo, Horn was credited with the idea of introducing an exotic animal — his pet cheetah — to the magic act.

“Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days,” Fischbacher said. “I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy’s life.”

The two became an institution in Las Vegas, where their magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. The pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year.

They returned to the stage in February 2009 for what was billed as their one and only comeback performance, to raise funds for the new Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. The brief performance, which included Montecore, became the basis of an episode of the ABC television show “20/20.”

Horn and Siegfried Fischbacher, both natives of Germany, had first teamed up in 1957 and made their Las Vegas debut a decade later. Siegfried & Roy began performing at the Mirage in 1990.

When they signed a lifetime contract with the Mirage in 2001, it was estimated they had performed 5,000 shows at the casino for 10 million fans since 1990 and had grossed more than $1 billion. That comes on top of thousands of shows at other venues in earlier years.

“Throughout the history of Las Vegas, no artists have meant more to the development of Las Vegas’ global reputation as the entertainment capital of the world than Siegfried and Roy,” Terry Lanni, chairman of MGM Mirage, the casino’s parent company, said after the attack.

The pair gained international recognition for helping to save rare white tigers and white lions from extinction. Their $10 million compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. The white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.

“The good news is that the white tigers and white lions are going into the 21st century,” Horn said in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. “The bad news is that if we don’t do something about the tigers in the wild, they will disappear.”

Siegfried & Roy’s show, incorporating animal antics and magic tricks, included about 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night. The show also had other exotic animals, including an elephant.

“Their show is so fast-paced the viewer has time only to gasp before the next dazzlement,” an Associated Press reviewer wrote in 1989 when they brought their act to New York.

“A white car drives on stage — as Liberace used to do — bringing a mother white tiger and three cubs. Roy rides an elephant, which disappears, then reappears. At the end, a 650-pound white tiger climbs atop a globe. With Roy on his back, they’re pulled into the air.”

“It’s a Las Vegas show and it’s nonstop entertainment. New Yorkers aren’t too sophisticated for this.”

A later spectacular developed for the Mirage opened with a flashy “Star Wars” scenario and Horn and Fischbacher arriving in their own mini space capsules. Another segment had Horn sitting atop a 30-foot (9.1-meter) pyramid that was “destroyed” by an explosion and fire, leaving him levitated high above the stage.

It was halfway during a performance Oct. 3, 2003, when Horn was alone on stage with the tiger that it suddenly lunged at him.

Horn, who had turned 59 that day, had never been injured during a show before, “not a scratch, not by an animal,” Bernie Yuman, the pair’s longtime manager, said at the time.

He said he thought Montecore, a 7-year-old male, got distracted by something in the audience and Horn was trying to calm him. Horn himself said later that he fainted and the tiger was trying to help him by dragging him offstage, though animal experts disputed that possibility.

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture explored a variety of theories but was unable to reach a conclusion on what caused the tiger to attack. In its final report, the USDA also said the show’s producers had failed to protect the audience because there was no barrier separating the exotic animals from the crowd.

In October 2006, three years after the attack, Horn and Fischbacher attended their induction into the Las Vegas Walk of Stars. Horn’s speech was sluggish at times and he walked a bit slow, but he called the event “a deeply emotional experience.”

Born in Nordenham, Germany, Horn met Fischbacher on a cruise ship in 1957. Fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while Horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.

They honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in Germany and Switzerland in the mid-1960s. Their break came in a Monte Carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to Las Vegas. The pair made their debut at the Tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.

The illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the Stardust’s “Lido de Paris.” Their show “Beyond Belief” opened in 1981 at the Frontier and played to thousands over seven years.

When Horn and Fischbacher became U.S. citizens in 1988, an elated Horn said, “Being an American means all the things we believe in.”

Horn once hand-fed a white lion cub born prematurely, starting with an eyedropper. But when a cub was donated to a zoo, Horn said he was heartbroken.

“When you love something, the hardest thing is to let it go,” he said. “But this is what Siegfried and Roy do. We live our dreams, and we fulfill our destiny.”

The wealthiest 600+ Americans saw their total wealth increase by $434 billion between March 18, when the government began implementing coronavirus-related lockdowns, and May 19, Americans for Tax Fairness, a Washington-based nonprofit, has reported, citing Forbes data.

The payday added about 15 percent to the exclusive group’s portfolios, with their total wealth jumping from about $2.948 trillion in March to $3.382 trillion now.

What’s more, the nonprofit found, the richest five men in America, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison, saw their wealth grow even more, by a total of $75.5 billion, or 19 percent, during the same period. The five men alone are said to have lapped up 21 percent of the overall increase in wealth among the 600+ richest Americans during this period.

The news comes amid reports Thursday that some 38.6 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, with 2.4 million claims filed in the last week alone. As many as 16 million workers have also likely lost employer-provided health insurance, while some 1.5 million Americans have fallen ill to the coronavirus, which has caused over 90,000 deaths in the US to date.

The spike in wealth inequality comes despite US lawmakers’ passage of several aid packages worth over $6 trillion since March, including a one-time direct payment of $1,200 to every American adult and $500 per child, hundreds of billions for unemployment benefits and other department of labor programs, as well as trillions for banks, major industries, and state, territorial local and tribal governments.

The spending has led the US national debt to skyrocket to nearly $25 trillion, which is 117 percent the size of America’s annual GDP.

Warren Buffett, who has seen his wealth balloon by $564 million over the past two months, has praised the government’s strategy of introducing more cash into the economy, but warned that there’s such a thing as too much of a good thing. “I think in general they’re the right thing, but I don’t think they’re without consequences, and I think they could be of extreme consequences if pushed far enough,” he said, speaking at a shareholder’s meeting in early May.",fake
1524,752,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/10/21253827/becoming-king-of-ventilators-may-result-in-unexpected-glut,2020-05-10,Becoming ‘King of Ventilators’ may result in unexpected glut,"WASHINGTON — As requests for ventilators from the national stockpile reached a crescendo in late March, President Donald Trump made what seemed like a bold claim: His administration would have 100,000 within 100 days.

At the time, the Department of Health and Human Services had not ordered any new ventilators since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in January. But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.

An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.

By the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.

“We became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.

But over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.

That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.

In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.

“We built, and we built, and we built,” Trump said. “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really — there’s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.”

Daniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.

But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.

“It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing,” Adelman said of the government purchases. “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.”

In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.

The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.

By the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.

Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.

Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators — about one-quarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.

“You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,” Cuomo said at a news conference,

It wasn’t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.

“The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.”

By late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.

Trump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.

But on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.

“In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,” Trump said.

By the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours.

Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.

That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.

In a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100-day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge.

It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president’s deadline.

General Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.

Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.

“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted on March 27. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”

GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.

The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!”

On April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.

The following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13.

Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.

HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.

But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.

Whether that’s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.

When AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website.

AP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.

Under its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.

A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.

The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.

Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent.

“Zoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity,” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.”

Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.

U.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.

“If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,” said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. “Your costs actually go up, not down.”

With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.

Cuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.

“We are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,” Cuomo said. “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need.”

More than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo’s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.

With nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.

In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.

In New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.

The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.

Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.

“It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.”

Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.

On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.

“People dying because they don’t have ventilators, and they’re not equipped to do what we did,” Trump said Friday. “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries.

A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.

“Surprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,” said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.

My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me — not to mention the “Ont some waffles!” cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.

But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children’s scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.

I’ve never worked from home before. I’m on Day 3 and can’t imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four — goodness knows how many more weeks.

But we can’t really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news — including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father’s home — my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I’m not a particularly religious man, but I’ve prayed about that in recent days.

But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.

I’m struck by how quiet it is in the mornings — before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.

This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of “Mr. Muhammad,” Matteo’s Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school’s music room. Typically, he’s accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he’d offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.

“Can I listen to Mr. Hammad?” Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.

Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, “Where’s Matteo? Where’s Logan?”

Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family — a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.

It’s been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, “Children are dying from the coronavirus.”

He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he’s still worried, he assured me that he isn’t.

But it’s hard to say what’s going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he’s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he’d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.

On Tuesday, Lucca brought me “lunch” — two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.

To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break — never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn’t actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.

“I want to go out and play baseball!” he shouted.

His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.

“Daddy shouldn’t have brought it up now,” she said.

So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

Special for USA TODAY

“One Morgan” is a saying among the approximately 20,000 people in Georgia’s Morgan County. But a county that preaches such a unified message is now as spread apart as ever, just like countless counties, cities and towns across the United States.

And like their peers around the country, seniors at Morgan County High have been deprived of prom, graduation and the last day of high school, not to mention their final sports seasons.

Coaches and administrators at the school demonstrated what it means to be “One Morgan” by delivering a personalized yard sign to all their seniors on the day it was announced spring sports were canceled. Baseball coach Merritt Ainslie even helped wrangle some cows that got loose from one family's pasture during a delivery.

“You would have thought I was giving them a million dollars,” tennis coach Stacy Manger said of the yard signs, which went to all seniors but were delivered by spring coaches to their seniors. “It was like we were coming home from World War II. It was just an incredible feeling and one I will never forget.”

In order to gauge the impact of coronavirus on athletes and coaches at one high school, sports journalism students from the University of Georgia spoke in April with members of the Morgan County community. These are their stories:

Comforting athletes

Manger walks her dogs past a collection of desolate tennis courts every day. She gazes at them, wishing she could still be with her players.

Manger, a former college athlete and now a licensed professional counselor, sympathizes with her “second family.”

“I’m thanking God that I got the degree I did because it’s helped me to not only be a better coach, but be able to help others,” said Manger.

Senior Sara Moore’s relationship with Manger has helped her put the sudden and cruel cancellation of her last high school tennis season behind her.

“She’s like a second mom to me,” Moore said. “She’s always there for us.”

High school coaches everywhere have a new task: comforting their athletes, especially the seniors.

Girls soccer coach Anne Stamps is navigating her way through “what feels like a grieving process.” In an attempt to bond with her players, Stamps wrote each of them a letter and sent those with a team picture “as something to bring us together.”

Stamps’ son Ethan also had his senior baseball season taken from him.

“I see it as a mom of a senior and then as a coach of seniors,” she said. “So I kind of know the face they put on for the public but I see them at home, and they’re really bummed out. No matter if they’re telling me they’re OK, I can tell if they’re really not because I see it at my own house. I think that’s helped me reach out to these seniors.”

Morgan County High had an enrollment of 939 students as of last October. Approximately 450 of them participated in one or more sanctioned athletic activity.

Unanswered questions

Seth Robertson and his teammates had already run a school record-setting 4x100-meter relay this season. He made no qualms about his expectations: the Bulldogs’ first state championship in the event.

“It was devastating, for sure, just knowing that we could never finish,” said Robertson, a football standout committed to Georgia Southern who also played on the Morgan County baseball team. “It’s always going to be that not knowing that we could go on to the state level and show what we had.”

For the senior athletes of Morgan County, like thousands of others across the country, the premature end to their seasons left many unanswered questions – on the field and in their relationships.

Haylee Patterson and her golf teammates were playing in their first tournament of the season when they realized the impact that coronavirus would have on the remainder of the schedule. Patterson was looking forward to helping rebuild a young team with fellow senior Maitlin Stapp.

“We loved playing with each other,” Patterson said. “We had made a really good friendship the last two years. It’s been really tough on us.”

Although Patterson takes solace in being able to golf later in life, drifting away from her friends is not the storybook ending she dreamed for her high school career.

“I think we’re really missing out on our final goodbyes,” Patterson said. “It just felt like it was taken so fast.”

Patterson and Robertson stay in touch with former teammates and work out in their backyards to maintain semblances of bygone routines. While Robertson stays fit in hopes of going to Statesboro in June for orientation and summer camp, the possibility of no college football this fall weighs heavily on him.

“That’s heartbreaking,” Robertson said. “I just hope that I can go out there on Saturday and play ball really.”

Pondering football

Doug Connelly, Morgan County’s athletic director, strives to mimic the normal work day, getting to his desk by 8 a.m., in his red M-lettered ball cap.

That desk, however, normally serves as his family’s dining room table. And instead of having it to himself, it's a multi-purpose workstation. His wife, Ivey Connelly, is a teacher. Their three children -- Trace, 10; Lila Mae, 7, and Tucker 5 – are students. They all use the same space.

He works on projects (notably a revised athletic handbook) and communicates with coaches virtually. He has the freedom of an extra hour’s sleep. But something feels off. Connelly yearns for daily handshake greetings with colleagues.

""Nothing is typical any more,"" Connelly said. ""This is all so new.""

A cloud of uncertainty looms over Connelly, too. With sports grounded, there's no plan for when, or if, football season — the main money maker — will begin.

Connelly has no concerns for lost spring-sport gate revenues. The cancellation of championships, and the travel expenses that saves, serves as a financial ""wash,"" he said. The county’s board of education also provides funding.

The issue lies with the uncertainty of football season and sponsorships. Connelly had designed a branding-display package for businesses. Some scheduled quarterly or bi-annual payments, and one is due in June. Connelly is debating whether to delay or cancel the collection.

""It's very important for us and helps run our teams,"" Connelly said. ""It's a huge concern as to whether they'll renew sponsorship.""

Everybody knows each other in Madison, so Connelly is extra aware of the burdens small businesses face. He’s trying to keep his programs afloat while not putting his neighbors in a position to sink.

Connelly struggles to find a solution. One that might not come until he’s back at his school office.

""When we do have our first football game, I feel confident that people will support,"" principal Miki Edwards said.

Chasing dad

Ethan Stamps needed eight home runs to break his father’s school career record of 32. Stamps hit five in the last two series the Bulldogs played.

“Every time I hit a home run, I looked at my dad, and we laughed at each other, because he was getting worried I was actually going to beat the record,” Ethan Stamps said.

Crandall Stamps graduated in 1988.

The younger Stamps will play baseball at Lipscomb University in Tennessee next season. His goals for this last high school season were to hit the ball hard and get on base, he said, but the thought of beating his dad’s record constantly ran through his mind.

“By him getting closer and closer with the home runs he hit, it gave him more drive and focus to keep working hard,” Crandall Stamps said. “It would have meant a lot to him.”

Not being able to beat the record was tough, Ethan Stamps said, but losing his final season with his teammates after a good start in region play was tougher.

Ainslie, the coach, said he hopes to get the whole team together over the summer to play one last game.

“When we are done with the shutdown, we would like to have a senior night and a banquet and a final intrasquad game, so they can have some memories of going out on the field one last time."" Ainslie said. ""We all need that.”

Recalling 9/11

Bill Malone has thought about 9/11 often in recent weeks. The Morgan County football coach for 26 years sees a lot of similarities in his community between then and now: fear, tragedy, uncertainty.

Back then, though, the time it took to return to normality was shorter.

“During 9/11, we canceled football games for that week,” Malone said. “But, by God, we knew we’d be out there next week.”

Things are different from 9/11, and by a wide margin. The rallying cry following the terrorist attacks for a small-town community gathering at a high school sports event can’t be replicated in a time of social distancing. For each day that rally doesn’t come, anxieties in Morgan County grow.

“This has been like a bulldozer to us,” Malone said. “This thing is just continuing to pile up and pile up and pile up, and we don’t know when it’s going to stop.”

You can hear the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns in people’s voices in Madison. Malone can also see it in the town square. What used to be a gathering place is now a ghost town.

“I have a very big concern for small businesses,” Malone said. “You go to the post office and that's about the only place you can go to in the town square.”

Football season serves as a beacon of hope here that can bring pride and joy back to the community. Now, a fall football season is in question, and hope dwindles as uncertainty grows.

“This is when we’re really starting to gear up,” Malone said. “There’s usually motivation that the season is right around the corner. Right now, we’re missing that.”",real

The news was issued as an unclassified public service announcement on CISA’s website on Wednesday. News reports over the weekend first said the warning, which is directed at organizations working on vaccine research, was imminent as numerous countries have redirected intelligence efforts toward other nations’ responses to and research on COVID-19.

“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors,” the PSA reads. “These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research. The potential theft of this information jeopardizes the delivery of secure, effective, and efficient treatment options.”

“The FBI is investigating the targeting and compromise of U.S. organizations by PRC-affiliated cyber actors.”

The US is not alone here, nor is China the only country attempting to use cyberattacks to spy and gather intelligence on other countries’ coronavirus treatment efforts and to capitalize on the current pandemic. Israel has accused Iran of attempting to cripple its water supply amid shelter-in-place orders. Earlier this month. the US and the UK issued a joint warning about the targeting of health care organizations and pharmaceutical and medical research companies. The warning didn’t name specific countries, but it insinuated that hacking threats may come from known bad actors, or “advanced persistent threat groups” as the warning words it, like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

The US State Department and the Trump administration are also engaged in a high-level back-and-forth with the Chinese government over assigning blame for the coronavirus pandemic and demands for global compensation, which itself stems in part from Trump’s adversarial relationship with the country throughout his presidency over trade secret theft and the outsourcing of American jobs and manufacturing. The US is now accusing China of spreading misinformation about the source of the virus and downplaying the severity and death toll of its ongoing outbreak to better position itself in the aftermath.

The PSA says that vaccine research organizations should be well aware that any press attention on its efforts may lead to heightened security risks, as it could tip off Chinese hackers and lead to potential cyberattacks. CISA and the FBI ask that such organizations patch all systems for vulnerabilities, actively scan all web applications for unauthorized access, improve security with protections like multistep authentication, and identify and suspend access to any suspicious accounts.",real

Amid the global pandemic, we were forced shortly after spring break from in-person classes to meeting on Zoom.

It seemed a relevant undertaking for students tasked mainly with writing about the world through the third-person objective observer lens. The assignment: Write a first-person essay on the impact of the pandemic upon their lives. Here are some of their reflections, which will be publicly podcasted soon:

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

Dylan Jeninga, a sophomore, writes, “There are invisible people, everyone knows that. They work hard to get us to notice them, but too often, we don’t. We walk by and hope they don’t talk to us.

“One such person lives, or did live, on the corner of Broadway and Granville, near my apartment. I don’t know her name. But she’s been there as long as I’ve lived in the neighborhood, wrapped in too many coats, selling Streetwise magazines.

“Once, when I worked at (a store) down the street, we got into a shouting match because she was spending too long in our bathroom, and my boss told me to kick her out. Ever since, I’ve avoided her. I walk right past without even looking at her.

“Of course, I haven’t done that much since the COVID-19 outbreak locked the city down. I’ve been sheltering in place... Even so, she’s been there, selling her magazines, her worldly belongings piled into a rusty cart behind her…

“.. .We may never know the full cost of the pandemic. But I do know that the woman has disappeared. ... All I can think about are all the times I walked by and tried not to look at her.”

Grace Koeppen, a sophomore integrated marketing communications major, writes: “It’s 7:30 a.m, and typically I’d be refreshed and ready to start my morning on campus. Instead I’m quarantined at home, groggy, with my laptop at my feet, holding 13 unread emails, four assignments due, and a Zoom meeting scheduled for two hours from now.

“This pandemic has misplaced me from everything that appeared normal … Working from home is hard.”

Daniel Itonyo, a senior economics major, writes: “To be honest, I’m not even sure what day it is. The coronavirus pandemic struck the world to a halt. ... The tragedy of this outbreak hits more closely when you realize that most of the deaths are within your community, the African American community.

“ … We all play a vital role, You and I, need to first of all acknowledge that it is easy to be ‘woke’ [or aware] but still fail to truly understand the urgency of the issues of racial disparity because we don’t live it and are blinded by our privileges.”

Lewis Rawlinson, a graduating musical arts major and cellist, writes, “New York City has begun mass burial for unaccounted for COVID-19 patients on Hart Island off the coast of the Bronx, the same site that was used to bury people who died of AIDS by the thousands. Those people also died alone in quarantine—one forged by stigma and bigotry.

“Those lost to the AIDS epidemic and those living with HIV today deserve respect and truth.

“During the early stages of their epidemic, there was no talk of flattening the curve. There was no emergency relief bill for resources and economic support. The government failed them and resulted in more graves that had to be dug, and it was because they were queer. That must never be forgotten.”

The same be said of the lessons from this storm. They must not be forgotten.

“70%"", one opined, with others suggesting it could by anything from a suggestive ""69"" % to 99.5.

“Doesn’t matter the percentage because whatever it is, it’s the right one"", one gushed.

“Here is the 🔨hammer break the internet babe"", another praised Thorne’s update.

In the picture, like in a few previous ones, she likewise rocked a messy-chic hairstyle, showing off her newly dyed locks.

Infamous is set for a digital release, with screenings slated to take place in a number of “virtual cinemas”, on 12 June, as the anti-coronavirus measures are projected to continue.

“Took a test the other day. And I found out that I have the antibodies,” the singer, 61, said in her latest Madame X-themed “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram Thursday.

“So tomorrow,” Madonna added, “I’m just going to go for a long drive in a car, and I’m going to roll down the window, and I’m going to breathe in, I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining.”

Antibody tests check antibodies in your blood to see if you were previously exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency says “a positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the virus that causes COVID-19.

Although Madonna may be ready to hit the road following her positive antibody test results, the CDC says it’s unclear if the antibodies will make you immune to the virus or prevent you from getting infected again.

Madonna captioned her quarantine diary with the hashtags #staysafe #staysane

“Here’s the good news,” she added on Instagram. “Tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”

Last month, Madonna stirred controversy after calling the coronavirus ”the great equalizer.”

“That’s the thing about COVID-19,” she said “It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell. It’s the great equalizer.”

According to the singer, “what’s terrible” about the virus is also “what’s great about it.”

Like many artists in the entertainment industry, Madonna canceled the remainder of her tour, “Madame X,” over safety concerns last month.

1565,266,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/live-stock-market-coronavirus.html,2020-04-08,Wall Street Rallies as Investors Focus on the Recovery,"
This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
The S&P 500 is up 23 percent from its March low.Wall Street resumed its rally on Wednesday. With a more than 3 percent gain, the S&P 500 is now up about 23 percent from its March 23 low.
The market has been steadily climbing since it hit that bottom, a rebound that began after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took steps to protect the U.S. economy from a collapse amid the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks are still down about 19 percent from their late February high.
More recently, the gains have reflected hope that the peak of the pandemic in many cities is near, or already past. The growth rate of hospitalizations in hot spots like New York is slowing; China has lifted its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged; and governments in parts of Europe are making plans to do the same.
To some extent, the recent gains also reflect Wall Street’s fear of missing out on the rebound that many analysts predicted would eventually come.
“If you wait until the coast is clear, you will have missed a huge part of the gains,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak a trading and asset management firm. “And professional investors can’t afford to do that.”
For now, though, it is big money managers — not mom-and-pop retail investors — who are in on the action. Hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers have swooped into the market, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that have been battered by the market sell-off.
Still, the market’s recent optimism is set against a grim backdrop of economic and human catastrophe that continues to play out — and which threatens to undercut any rally at a moment’s notice.
In Europe, data released on Wednesday showed that Germany and France, the largest economies in the region, were heading toward their sharpest downturns since World War II.
There’s more data to come. A new report on weekly jobless claims on Thursday is certain to show millions more Americans are out of work. The two prior reports recorded more than 10 million claims for unemployment in late March.
Investors go shopping: “We will never get these prices again.”
After a 3.4 percent rise on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has bounced 23 percent from its low in a disastrous March, despite a darkening outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.
One reason: It’s the time to buy for investors able to stomach the market’s swoons.Cole Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund, has been snapping up bargains in beaten-up parts of the market, like oil and energy producers, homebuilders and shopping-mall companies, that are closely tied to short-term swings in the economy.
“We will never get these prices again,” said Mr. Smead, whose fund has $1.3 billion in assets.As economically damaging as the pandemic will no doubt be, Wall Street is starting to see a path forward that wasn’t clear a few weeks ago. Slowing infection rates, hefty government relief packages and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to calm the markets have helped eased investors’ minds.
Some of the buyers are opportunistic hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that were battered by the market sell-off. Some are traders feeling pressure to get into a rising market. And some are short-sellers forced to buy to minimize their own losses.
But mom-and-pop investors have largely been sitting out — a sign that the rally doesn’t reflect widespread optimism.
WeWork skips rent payments as it seeks to renegotiate better deals.
WeWork has not made scheduled rent payments to the landlords of some of the buildings where it operates its co-working spaces, according to a person briefed on the situation.
The decision to hold back rent is part of WeWork’s efforts to renegotiate better deals with building owners as the company tries to cut costs and limit its losses. WeWork’s executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, said in December that the company would try to get better terms from landlords, but the economic swoon caused by the coronavirus pandemic has made the task more urgent.
“Rather than implementing a company-wide policy on rent payments, we are individually reaching out to our more than 600 global landlord partners to work in good faith towards finding asset-specific solutions that benefit all parties involved,” WeWork said in a statement.
The person briefed on the situation said WeWork was seeking to renegotiate leases around the world, not just in the United States.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that WeWork was skipping rent payments.The virus outbreak has emptied many of WeWork’s locations and may reduce demand for its space over the longer terms. Seeing the empty spaces, landlords might be persuaded to reduce WeWork’s lease payments, but they also know that SoftBank, the company’s dominant shareholder, committed billions of dollars to finance WeWork’s expansion.
With hospitals in dire straits, insurance companies are speeding up payments.In a sign of just how desperate hospitals and doctors are for cash during the coronavirus pandemic, insurance companies, notorious for slow-walking their payments to health care providers, are now speeding up how quickly they pay.
“There was a universal cry for cash,” said Paul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, which said it would advance up to $200 million in payments to hospitals and doctors.
With revenues down for surgeries and other care not viewed as essential, providers are scrambling for money to pay for protective equipment and other supplies. “The pressure on the entire health care ecosystem is something I’ve never seen before,’‘ said Mr. Markovich, who hopes to get out the first payments as soon as this week.
“We’re effectively advancing payment now and collecting later,” he said, even as it is also working with customers about letting them delay paying premiums.
UnitedHealth, which owns one of the nation’s largest insurance companies, said it would also take a series of steps, like waiving the need for pre-authorization when patients see a new doctor or go to a skilled nursing facility, that should result in nearly $2 billion in payments getting in the hands of providers more quickly.

Another way to see the recession: Power usage is way down.New data on electricity use suggest that U.S. economic activity probably declined more over the past three weeks than it did during the entire year and a half of the Great Recession. It may already be the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; it is certainly the fastest.
These numbers are important because our official statistics cannot keep pace with the abrupt economic changes the coronavirus shutdown has caused. All those closed stores, silenced factories and darkened office buildings are yet to be counted in the government’s official economic numbers, which take months to collect, process and report.
But evidence of the sharp economic shift shows up in a large and rapid decline in electricity usage over recent weeks.
Food banks are squeezed by rising hunger and dwindling resources.
Demand for food assistance in the United States is surging, as millions of Americans find themselves out of work and school closures mean that many families who counted on them for free or subsidized meals need to turn elsewhere.
The rise in need is coming just as food banks face shortages of both donated food and volunteer workers.
It’s a nationwide phenomena:At Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, the amount of food donated for March dropped by nearly half. The food bank typically purchases $73,000 of food in a month this time of year but has spent $675,000 in the past four weeks.In Jonesboro, Ark., after a powerful tornado struck, a food bank received less than half the donations it expected because nervous families held on to what they had.In Washington State and Louisiana, the National Guard has been called in to help pack food boxes and ensure that the distributions run smoothly.Feeding America, the nation’s largest network of food banks, with more than 200 affiliates, has projected a $1.4 billion shortfall in the next six months alone.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization in Washington. She has studied food security for more than a quarter century. “People love the phrase ‘the perfect storm,’” she added, “but nothing is built for this.”
Europe’s biggest economies brace for the sharpest drop since World War II.
Europe’s pandemic-induced lockdowns were widely expected to throw the continent into a deep recession. Germany and France, the largest economies, said on Wednesday that they were headed toward their sharpest downturns since World War II, a warning that showed just how bad it’s about to get.
France officially slid into a recession after suffering one of the worst quarterly contractions in more than 50 years. Growth tumbled an estimated 6 percent from January to April, from the fourth quarter, the central bank said. For every two weeks the population remains under confinement, the economy shrinks by at least 1.5 percent, it added.
And Germany is sliding toward its deepest recession on record, with growth expected to plunge almost 10 percent from April through June, five leading economic institutes said Tuesday.

Before its November introduction, analysts had predicted that Disney Plus would take a full year to sign up half that many subscribers. A hit series, “The Mandalorian,” has greatly increased demand. The pandemic has likely also helped, with parents looking for ways to entertain homebound children.Nordstrom, one of the country’s best-performing department stores, said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it did not have a “firm date” on when its stores would reopen. Most of the company’s work force — about 69,000 people, according to a separate filing — has been furloughed “or assigned zero hours of work.” Nordstrom has also temporarily closed its headquarters in Seattle.Amazon said it planned to pause a pilot program that shipped products for sellers on its marketplace in a bid to ease the pressures on its logistics operations, which are stretched thin by the surge in online shopping.

1581,722,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/8/21252534/katie-miller-mike-pence-coronavirus-stephen-miller,2020-05-08,VP Pence’s spokesperson tests positive for coronavirus,"WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary has the coronavirus, the White House said Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week.

President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.

Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working out of the White House.

Katie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.

“This is why the whole concept of tests aren’t necessarily great,” Trump said. “The tests are perfect but something can happen between a test where it’s good and then something happens.”

The positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19.

Six people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.

None of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested “out of an abundance of caution,” a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.

The official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence’s staff — which works next door in the Executive Office Building — are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.

Pence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday.

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president.

Meadows said the White House was “probably the safest place that you can come,” but he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.

The White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.

“We’ve already put in a few protocols that we’re looking at, obviously, to make sure that the president and his immediate staff stay safe. But it’s not just the president, it’s all the workers that are here ... on a daily basis,” Meadows said.

Trump’s valet’s case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March. The valet tested positive Wednesday.

The White House was moving to shore up its protection protocols to protect the nation’s political leaders. Trump said some staffers who interact with him closely would now be tested daily. Pence told reporters Thursday that both he and Trump would now be tested daily as well.",real

On May 1st, hourly employees — a vast majority of which are among the company’s 250,000 or so warehouse workers who cannot work from home — must request an unpaid leave of absence to continue staying home if they do not want to work out of fear for their safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Throughout the coronavirus crisis, Amazon’s hourly workers in its fulfillment centers and warehouses have been able to stay home without pay and retain their jobs. For those who were reporting to work and became sick, or who came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, Amazon has been offering two weeks of paid time off.

“If any team members are unable or unwilling to work a scheduled shift, they can use unlimited unpaid time off through the month of April without penalty, and we are supportive if someone chooses to stay home,” reads Amazon’s original March blog post outlining its worker safety measures.

Amazon says people who live with or are themselves high-risk individuals will be eligible for leave

Amazon now says employees must start reporting to work or request leave, and the requirements for leave include having an existing health condition or living with someone who does, the logic being such individuals are high-risk for complications due to COVID-19. Everyone else will need to report to work, according to Bloomberg.

It is unclear if workers who are not eligible for such leave but who choose to not show up for work anyway will be subject to termination. The policy will, however, apply to both part-time and full-time workers, Bloomberg reports. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company also said back in March it would be increasing its hourly wages by $2 per hour for workers in Canada, the UK, the US, and various parts of Europe. That bumped pay for hourly employees from the minimum of $15 an hour the company set back in October 2018 up to $17. Earlier today, Amazon announced an extension on that temporary pay increase from the end of April to May 16th. The company says the cost of its pay increases is estimated to be $700 million.

“We’ve extended the increased hourly pay outlined below through May 16. We are also extending double overtime pay in the U.S. and Canada. These extensions increase our total investment in pay during COVID-19 to nearly $700 million for our hourly employees and partners,” reads an update to Amazon’s blog post on worker safety measures it published today.

“In addition, we are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,” the update goes on to say. “We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.”",real

Eales says MLS is more fortunate than other leagues around the world that play the traditional fall-to-spring schedule and may have trouble completing their seasons in such a compressed time frame.

MLS was just two weeks into its season when play was halted March 12 because of the pandemic. The league has set a tentative return date of May 10, though the growing death toll in the United States could force that date to be pushed back.

Eales says everything is on the table, including the possibility of resuming league play in empty stadiums.

“We’re fortunate that we had just started our season,” he said Monday during a teleconference with Atlanta media. “We have the whole calendar year to reschedule the games we missed. The emphasis is on playing all 34 games plus the playoffs.”

MLS will likely schedule more midweek games and push back its MLS Cup championship game into mid-December in a bid to play a full season, according to Eales. He added that the playoffs could begin in mid-November — around the time MLS had been planning its title game.",real

The U.S. Embassy in China confirmed on Saturday that a 60-year-old American infected with coronavirus died at a hospital in Wuhan on Thursday. It's the first known American death from the outbreak, which has been declared an emergency by the World Health Organization.

""We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,"" an embassy spokesperson said. ""Out of the respect for the family's privacy, we have no further comment.""

At the latest count the 2019-nCoV virus, which can cause a form of pneumonia, has infected nearly 35,000 people worldwide and killed more than 700, Feng reports.

About 800 Americans and their family members have been evacuated from Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated and where the vast majority of known cases have been. They are being kept in quarantine on U.S. military bases, under the care of doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It's not known why this patient was not among the evacuees.

The CDC reports that as of Friday, 12 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the U.S. across six states: Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin.

1597,1847,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/fact-coronavirus-vaccines-will-contain-aborted-human-babies/,2020-05-23,FACT: Coronavirus vaccines will contain aborted human babies,"(Natural News) Pro-lifers everywhere had better think long and hard about what they plan to do in the event that state or local governments try to mandate vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) once a jab is commercially released because chances are those syringes will contain the remnants of aborted babies.

Even though President Trump has said that Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will not be mandated at the federal level, there is still the possibility that some states may try to force them locally, which will put not just those opposed to vaccination in a tough position but also those who recognize the sanctity of unborn human life.

After it was announced recently that Canada’s largest federal research and development organization has teamed up with a Chinese vaccine company to test a new trial coronavirus vaccine in Canada, Dr. Alan Moy, M.D., founder and scientific director of the John Paul II Medical Research Institute and CEO of Cellular Engineering Technologies decided to do some digging, upon which he discovered that the test vaccine in question is made from aborted fetal cell lines.

CanSino Biologics Inc., also known as CanSinoBIO, is the name of the Chinese firm that partnered up with Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) to conduct trials on Ad5-nCoV, as it is being called, which Dr. Moy found contains a cell line known as HEK293 that was derived from unborn children that were murdered while still inside their mothers’ wombs.

“Since it’s using an adenovirus replication-defective vector, it is using HEK293,” Dr. Moy told LifeSiteNews. “HEK293 is an aborted fetal cell line.”

What’s worse, Ad5-nCoV probably won’t even work

Besides its unethical origins, the Ad5-nCoV more than likely will not even work as promised, Dr. Moy warns. As it turns out, there is a high incidence of immunity against Ad5, so most of the people who are injected with it will confer no protection whatsoever against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I don’t envy Canadians,” Dr. Moy is further quoted as saying. “Your government and PM (prime minister) have mandated draconian policies that are anti-life … Not a good vaccine solution if pro-life or pro-choice.”

What is further confounding is the fact that Canada would even agree to contract with a vaccine company based out of China, which is where this whole crisis originated. Ad5-nCoV was reportedly also co-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology which, like all other Chinese institutions, is governed and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

This vaccine is said to be the first “phase 2” coronavirus vaccine, meaning it has been approved to be “safely” used in human test subjects. And the Canadian government could not be more excited about the prospect of injecting as many Canadians as possible with it to “cure” them of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“NRC is proud of our ongoing partnership with CanSino Biologics,” stated NRC President Iain Stewart in a recent press release.

Dr. Xuefeng Yu, chairman and CEO of CanSinoBIO, also stated in the same press release that his company has “strong connections to Canada” and is “proud to be building on past successes and continuing our ongoing partnership with the NRC to address health needs on a global scale.”

Amazingly, both the NRC and CanSinoBIO are proud of their proprietary HEK293 aborted baby cell line, which they say will help “to advance a scale-up production process for the vaccine candidate.” In other words, thanks to these aborted babies, Canada and China will be able to produce Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for mass distribution much faster than normal, paving the way for a global vaccination campaign unlike anything the world has ever seen.

24/7 Wall Street

Since the lockdown caused by concerns over the spread of coronavirus, people have been left to their own devices at home, and those include cell phones, laptops, iPads, video games and television remote controls, among others.

Before the pandemic, these devices were frequently used – they are sometimes called high-touch items – and now that so many of us are home, they are being handled even more often, and not necessarily by a single user. That raises the specter of spreading the dreaded coronavirus. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.

24/7 Tempo has compiled a list of cleaning tips for your phones, tablets and other devices. We reviewed articles in trade publications, as well as general media sources to create our list.

Those using electronic devices need to clean the plastic and steel surfaces with the proper disinfectants. These are the kinds of surfaces where the coronavirus can survive for up to 72 hours. Most of the products used for cleaning might already be available in your home. The American Chemistry Council has a list of EPA-approved products. Soap and hot water is also a safe option that will help reduce the spread of the virus. Obviously, always use common sense when cleaning electronics: unplug them first, do not submerge them, and only use a small amount of cleaner on a cloth so that moisture doesn't enter any openings.

Cell phones

The two leading cell-phone makers updated their websites to inform customers how to clean those devices. Apple said on its website that iPhones can be safely cleaned with disinfectant wipes, including products such as Clorox sheets. Samsung said you can wipe down the device with a microfiber cloth containing an alcohol-based solution (70%). A National Institute of Infectious Disease study of mobile phones from 2017 found a median of more than 17,000 bacterial gene copies on each.

Tablets

A tablet is a portable computer such as an iPad. You can use alcohol-based agents to clean your device and attention should be paid to the screen and buttons. Remove any case on the tablet and clean underneath. When you put the case back on, wipe down the outside of it.

Phone chargers

Cleaning phone chargers to remove dirt and other impurities, as well as viruses, can be tricky. You can use a can of compressed air and spray the air in short bursts into the port. Otherwise, bring the charger to be cleaned by a professional.

Touch screens

Computer touch screens can be cleaned by using a small amount of warm, soapy water or a solution made to specifically clean touch screens. When cleaning, use a microfiber cloth to avoid scratching the screen. Mixing water and rubbing alcohol works, too but any mixture of more than 50% alcohol might damage the screen and remove the coating that protects it from fingerprints.

Keyboards

Keyboards have lots of germs and are potential virus havens. Researchers at the University of Arizona found that the average desktop has 400 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat. A New England Journal of Medicine study showed that the coronavirus was still detectable on plastic and steel for up to 72 hours, meaning viruses can live longer on non-porous surfaces such as keyboards. Keyboards should be unplugged and then shaken. Then they can be cleaned by gently wiping them down by using a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Stay away from bleach and don't let moisture into the openings.

Remote controls

Now that we're sheltering in place, we're watching a lot more television and using the remote control, which can potentially harbor the coronavirus. Among the cleaning agents that are effective for cleaning remote controls are Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. The American Chemistry Council has a list of products approved by the EPA.

Mouse

Like many devices, your mouse can be cleaned using products such as Clorox cleaner and bleach products, Lysol disinfectants, Purell sanitizers, and Zep disinfectants. Before you start cleaning, unplug your mouse and remove batteries. Researchers have found that the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like the mouse.

Monitors

Computer monitors don't receive frequent contact from hands, but viruses can still settle on them so they should be cleaned periodically. Cleaning agents should not come into direct contact with the monitors and instead droplets of the agent should be applied to a microsoft fiber cloth, which can then be used to clean the monitor.

PCs

Personal computers can harbor germs and viruses, and the risk rises as more people use the same device. A study published in the American Journal of Infection Control said bacteria and other potentially hazardous microbes can be present on shared computer terminals and may be transmitted to users. Before cleaning a PC, unplug the device. PCs can be cleaned by using a lint-free cloth made from microfiber. Don't use aerosol sprays or abrasive cleaning agents and don't spray cleaners directly on the computer. Make sure no moisture enters any openings.

Laptops

Often receiving daily use, laptops can be major carriers of germs, thereby potentially spreading bacteria and disease. A 2018 New York Times article recommended laptop users begin by turning the machine off and removing the battery, if easily done, then cleaning out all of the crevices using canned air. The outside can then be wiped down using a microfiber cloth with a few drops of rubbing alcohol added to it – never apply alcohol directly to the computer. The screen can be wiped using a microfiber cloth dampened with plain water.

Nebulizers

Nebulizers are machines that spray medicine as a fine mist via a mouthpiece or mask, and are often used to treat asthma and other lung diseases. As nebulizers generate particles that can carry bacteria and viruses deep into one's lungs, some medical agencies, such as Canada's Alberta Health Services, have recommended their use be avoided during the pandemic. They can be cleaned by rinsing the cup with warm water and allowing it to air dry after each use and washing with warm, soapy water at the end of each day. They should be disinfected at least once per week.

Watches

The coronavirus can linger on the glass surface of watches. To eradicate the virus, use products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap to disinfect the surface. Clorox wipes can be used to sterilize Apple Watches, though the company cautions customers not to use the agent on fabric or leather bands and not to use bleach. Infectious disease researchers recommend cleaning wearables such as Fitbit devices frequently.

Headphones

Headphones can collect debris and oil from one's skin, and generally pick up germs throughout the day. Due to their electronic nature, cleaning them can be tricky. One can use a towel with warm water mixed with a drop or two of a mild detergent. A small amount of alcohol may also be used, though depending on the type of headphones being cleaned, alcohol can have damaging effects. If it is used, it should be dried off carefully when done.

E-readers

The supply chain for e-reader companies – including Amazon and Sony – was thrown into disarray in January as the virulence of the coronavirus became known. Researchers have discovered that the virus can live for up to three days on plastic and steel, which are commonly used in electronic devices like e-readers. E-readers should be cleaned with products such as Clorox wipes, alcohol-based sanitizers, or soap and hot water to expunge the virus.

Printers

Printers have become ubiquitous in American homes along with laptops and personal computers and as such can also host the coronavirus. Owners of printers are advised to turn them off before cleaning. They should wear protective disposable rubber or nitrile gloves during cleaning. Areas of the printer that can come in contact with humans – control or cover panels, for example – need to be cleaned with a solution of 70%-plus isopropyl alcohol, although 99.9% isopropyl alcohol is recommended. Don't spray the solution directly on the device – put it on a lint-free rag or cloth. Use a glass cleaner for the copying surface. Before powering up, make sure all surfaces are dry.

Game consoles

Whether you are an XBox One or Playstation aficionado, you need to clean the consoles for these game systems. Game consoles qualify as so-called high-touch areas. Though the coronavirus is spread through droplets emitted by coughing or sneezing, particles can last for up to three days on plastic and steel. They can be cleaned by wiping them down with a 70% alcohol solution or disinfecting wipes. Rubbing alcohol can also be used if Clorox or Lysol wipes are in short supply.

Cameras

With so many people in lockdown, those sheltering in place are recording these extraordinary times in photographs. Shutterbugs need to be aware that bringing a camera to your face also exposes you to germs and viruses. Enthusiasts should wipe down the camera with a soft, dry cloth that contains denatured alcohol.

Fans

Whether or not the new coronavirus is airborne is still up for debate. However, fans – including ceiling fans, window fans, and those on stands – have the potential to spread aerosolized human pathogens. Those in the vicinity of fans can remove dust from the blades using a damp cloth or a vacuum cleaner with attachment. It's also recommended that those most at risk of the dangers of COVID-19 wear a face mask when fans are in use.

ATM machines

ATMs can be exceptionally dirty because of the many fingers touching their screens and keypads, as well as the presence of dollar bills, which are notoriously unclean. Following stay-at-home orders, many banks – including JPMorgan Chase and PNC – closed branches, requiring customers to rely on the machines. According to COVID-19 safety guidelines from the National ATM Council, users should wear disposable gloves or use hand sanitizer for any contact with ATM terminals and cash. They should also follow CDC guidelines, such as washing hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding touching one's face, and maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people.

It's been nearly 12 weeks since the first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed in Washington state, and it's unclear when the wave of infections may subside.

One of the biggest questions for officials who are managing the government response is whether the country has reached the peak. In this Special Report, NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro wraps up the week's best reporting on all of these angles and more. Click ""Listen"" at the top of the page.

The Trump administration is looking at a variety of scientific modeling to try to figure that out. Projections of the death toll vary by the tens of thousands.

""We're nearing the peak of the outbreak,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told NPR this week. He added that he expects ""to see the curve begin to go down.""

But some governors say their states are still struggling to get needed supplies. And critics like retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who helped coordinate military relief in response to Hurricane Katrina, say the federal government can still be more aggressive in centralizing the distribution of resources.

Meantime, as Americans settle into wearing masks in public to avoid transmitting the coronavirus, they also need to look after their emotional well-being. A Kaiser Family Foundation Health tracking poll found that an increasing share of Americans — about half now, up from a third — say their mental health has been affected by the coronavirus crisis.",real

The reality so far for the current flu season is still emerging. There have been at least 23,000 deaths from flu during the 2019-2020 season, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The upper range of the estimate for deaths is 59,000.

The CDC estimates there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses and 390,000 hospitalizations.

The CDC estimates are based on weekly surveillance data and are preliminary.

The rates of hospitalization for flu ""remain moderate"" overall, according to the CDC. But some age groups have experienced higher hospitalization rates than usual. Flu hospitalizations are ""the highest CDC has on record"" for young children, up to age 4, and adults ages, 18-49.

While the flu can send hundreds of thousands of people to the hospital each year, the seasonal effect is reasonably well understood and planned for. The comparison between flu and COVID-19 doesn't capture the strain that the new coronavirus is putting on hospitals.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is hard to predict. And the surge in cases requiring intensive care that was seen in China and now in Italy can lead to a health system's collapse, health officials have said.",real

Tyler O'Neil on 'Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center.'

Big Tech, Corporate America, Democrats, and left-leaning media outlets consider the Southern Poverty Law Center to be a reliable arbiter of “hate.” They have blacklisted organizations the SPLC brands “hate groups,” cutting them off from social media platforms, event spaces, online tools, and even credit cards.

But the SPLC is far from credible. In March 2019, the group was wracked by a racial discrimination and sexual harassment scandal that saw its leadership fired or forced to resign. Former employees came forward exposing the “con,” showing how the SPLC exaggerates “hate” to bilk donors and attack its political opponents. This discredited group is not to be trusted, but many powerful people continue to use its “hate group” accusation to silence conservatives and exile them from polite society.

Academician Yevgeny Mikrin, general designer of Russian Space Corporation Energia, who was earlier diagnosed with coronavirus, died in Moscow. The scientist died at Kommunarka hospital near Moscow, which specializes on the treatment of Covid-positive patients.

""He was 64 years old. He was a very bright person who devoted his whole life to the development of the domestic space program.

Vladimir Fortov, an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, added that Mikrin was an outstanding specialists who could feel the work of technical devices. He was responsible for launching, supervising and docking processes in the manned space program.

“This is a huge loss,” he said.

The press service of the Russian Federal Space Agency Roscosmos confirmed the sad news and set out condolences to all his relatives and friends. The date and the place of the scientist’s funeral has not been reported yet.

Many said the pandemic has led them to believe that in-person meetings are often unnecessary, and that traveling for business may not be as valuable — or essential — as they once thought.

As Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, said, ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

This feature is part of a series based on conversations with more than 200 CEOs on how business will be transformed by the coronavirus. To read more, click here.

As the global pandemic upends business, CEOs are figuring out what practices they need to keep — and what they can lose for good.

From scaling back on their real estate to rethinking remote work, mandated social distancing has forced leaders to confront the idea that what used to be the professional norm may no longer be the best way to continue. That includes taking a hard look at business trips and questioning when they're really worth taking.

As the pandemic shut down airlines and hotels and brought travel to a halt, the $1 trillion business travel sector took a massive hit. According to data compiled by Tourism Economics for the US Travel Association, travel spending was down by $119 billion for the period between March 1 and April 25, a decrease of more than 80% over the same period in 2019.

About 30% of total travel spending in 2019 was for business travel, accounting for about $334.2 billion in spending and about 2.5 million jobs, according to the US Travel Association. Business travel is typically also the biggest revenue generator for the hotel industry, and conventions and other meetings being pushed out into 2021 is a growing concern.

Travel industry experts have been predicting that after the outbreak eases in the US, vacations will return well before business travel does.

Business Insider recently asked more than 200 chief executive officers at some of the world's largest companies how business will be transformed by the coronavirus.

Many of these leaders noted that the pandemic has already caused their stance on in-person meetings to evolve.

""I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work,"" Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Business Insider. ""Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.""

""It may be the case that we can do less travel, but we can get more done, that we're more thoughtful about what the live meetings need to be,"" said Doug Ingram, CEO of Sarepta Therapeutics, a medical research company based in Massachusetts.

The end of the one-meeting business trip

Donna Imperato, CEO of PR and communications firm BCW Global, told Business Insider that the company recently completed a pitch that was drawn out over the course of months and involved employees traveling all over the world.

In retrospect and in regards to all the travel involved, she said, ""I don't think it was necessary to spend all that time to get the same outcome.""

Imperato isn't the only leader rethinking how prominent a role business travel needs to play in future operations.

The coronavirus pandemic has forced a shift to remote work that had already been in progress for several years. And, businesses that have implemented the infrastructure for remote work in response to the pandemic may realize that that setup works for them just fine.

Some executives speaking with Business Insider said they were surprised to find that going remote has actually made their workforce more productive, perhaps because they are doing less networking and person-to-person interacting.

""Paradoxically, the crisis has significantly improved the way we operate and made us more efficient with no lunches, dinners, or traveling,"" Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital, a media company based in London, said. Sorrell is also the founder and former CEO of advertising giant WPP.

This shift in mindset will likely mean that many business leaders will take a more discerning approach when scheduling trips.

""Undoubtedly, the experiments we're all going through by using video conferencing, FaceTime facilities for quick meetings a quick exchange of ideas has certainly changed significantly our behavior,"" Thomas Flohr, CEO of private jet company VistaJet, told Business Insider. ""So in the short-term, I don't see travel [is going] to rebound anywhere in the near future.""

Paul Hudson, CEO of Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company that's headquartered in New Jersey and employs more than 100,000 people globally, said that ""the one-business meeting trip will disappear.""

""People will be more comfortable with virtual meeting solutions and travel will become something we do when it's absolutely necessary,"" he said.

Embracing alternatives — for now

Several leaders said it would take a viable vaccine for this to change.

""We'll continue to rely on technology and new thinking to perform our jobs,"" Dave Burwick, CEO of The Boston Beer Company, said. ""And at least until there's a vaccine, we expect to be traveling less on planes and not interacting with large groups of people.""

Until then, business leaders are embracing virtual meetings and conferences.

""There will still be times when the industry will need to come together in person. I look forward to the day when there is a vaccine so that will be possible,"" Terry Duffy, chairman and CEO of CME Group, said. ""In the meantime, we will need to be more creative, rethinking old ways of doing business and developing new ones that fit this new reality.""

Business travel will look different once it resumes

Hilton is developing new hygiene protocols, including placing a seal on doors to indicate that no one has entered since it was last cleaned. Hilton

Hotels and other hospitality branches catering to business travelers will likely have to implement additional hygiene measures as they start to welcome people back.

55% of the business travelers surveyed by Engagious said that visible medical screenings like temperature checks and swabs before entering a venue would have a positive impact on their willingness to resume visits to places like airports, hotels, and restaurants.

Hospitality businesses are gearing up for this shift in mentality, rolling out enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing measures. As Chris Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton, told Business Insider, hotels will endure as gathering points for a variety of events, including business meetings, ""though likely with some adjustments.""

""As wedding receptions, business meetings, and social gatherings return, the way our Team Members deliver food and beverage service will also change,"" Nassetta said. ""We can expect the demand for buffet and communal dining to change, and the opportunity for personalized, one-on-one service to increase.""

Ultimately, it's likely to be years before business travel returns to the levels set in 2019, if it ever does.

Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, said in an April earnings call that business travel could take more than five years to return to levels from last year. Business travel makes up about a third of Southwest's passenger traffic, he said.

""Based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be,"" he said. ""This one feels like it could be worse.""",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Michigan residents on alert as Midland could be under 9 feet of water

Urging residents to evacuate and warning that downtown Midland could be under 9 feet of water by Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency after the Edenville and Sanford dams breached. Several dams upstream of Midland along the Tittabawassee had either been breached or were releasing water uncontrollably after 4 to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday, including the Edenville and Sanford dams, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people in mid-Michigan. ""Please do not hesitate. Go to stay with a friend or relative or go to one of these shelters now,"" Whitmer warned, adding that even at a shelter, people should try to do the best they can to practice social distancing and wear a face covering to protect themselves and others from the coronavirus.

Bring your mask to the Disney Springs reopening

Face masks and temperature checks are in and cash payments are out Wednesday for the partial reopening of Disney Springs, the large shopping, dining and entertainment complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Visitors must have temperature checks before entering and wear face masks except when dining. Disney also will limit the number of people allowed in and in certain areas. Wednesday's move is the first phase of Disney World's comeback plan, the company said, though no reopening dates have yet been announced. The resort has been closed since March amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Some J.C. Penney stores reopen as more plan to close

Retailer J.C. Penney plans to reopen about 115 of its stores on Wednesday that had been closed since March because of COVID-19. Forty-one stores previously reopened. The move comes days after the troubled chain filed for bankruptcy. According to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, about 29% of the retailer's 846 stores, or 242 locations, will close between the current fiscal year and next fiscal year. Meanwhile, Amazon is reportedly in talks to acquire J.C. Penney, according to a report by Women's Wear Daily.

McDonald's workers plan strike for better coronavirus protection

Hundreds of McDonald's workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees from COVID-19. Labor organizers, which include the ""Fight for $15"" minimum wage labor campaign, say there have been dozens of McDonald's workers who have had COVID-19. They also cite a survey of more than 800 McDonald's workers in which nearly one quarter reported being told not to wear masks and gloves and four in 10 reported that social distancing was very difficult or impossible at their restaurants. The company disputes the allegations. The strike comes one day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

The shifts are long and the scenes are heartbreaking inside a Maryland hospital where nurses and doctors have been treating coronavirus patients for weeks, unable to let family inside to visit loved ones on their death beds.

One of the hardest moments of a recent work day for registered nurse Julia Trainor was intubating a patient, and then calling the patient's husband so he could talk to his wife. He was not allowed in the hospital.

""I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear as he told her that he loved her so much, and then I had to wipe away her tears,"" says Trainor, who works in a surgical intensive care unit.

""The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her,"" Hamil said. Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift. ""Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it's hard to think of the family that they are missing,"" Mehring said.

Story The highly infectious COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus has infected more than 580,000 people across the United States and killed nearly 24,000. In Maryland, where residents have been ordered to stay at home since March 30 to stem the spread of the disease, around 9,000 have tested positive for the virus and more than 260 have died. After finishing what for many was a more than 12-hour shift, some nurses and doctors at one hospital shared with Reuters the hardest moments of their days. The hospital asked that it not be named. The medical workers agreed that one of the toughest parts of the job - more than the exhausting schedule or adjusting to work in a new unit - was witnessing the toll on patients and families.

Capadngan, 29, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift Because of the hospital's no-visitor policy, which was implemented to prevent further spread of the virus, the medical staff must care for the patients' physical needs and offer as much emotional support as they can muster in the absence of the patients' families. ""The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing COVID patients die helpless and without their family members beside them,"" says Ernest Capadngan, a nurse in the hospital's biocontainment unit.

Wilson, 53, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we're not used to dealing with,"" said Wilson. Communicating with the families has weighed heavily on the hospital staff. Staff cannot bend the no-visit rules, even when a family calls in desperation. ""I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn't come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him,"" says Tracey Wilson, a nurse practitioner.

Fare, 25, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift. ""My team has been really great to me. We've worked really well together and we've really come together in this crisis. We don't really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it's been a journey but I think that's what is giving me hope,"" said Fare. ""One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a COVID patient say goodbye over an iPad,"" says Tiffany Fare, a nurse in the biocontainment unit. ""You can't see your loved one and then they're gone.""

Mack, 46, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people's lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight individually,"" said Mack. There are very few opportunities to rest during a shift, although colleagues look out for one another and try to cover for each other when someone needs a break. Cheryll Mack, a registered nurse in the emergency room, says she tries to get outside for 15 minutes during the day to breathe. ""It has given me relief, just fresh air,"" Mack says.

Bell, 41, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift. ""The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it's really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you're taking care of them. It's also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public,"" Bell said. Each shift concludes with a similar decontamination drill. Nurses and doctors must remove their personal protective equipment and shower immediately before coming in contact with their family at home. ""I take a very long, very hot shower. And then I usually sit on the couch and... read a book or watch some mindless reality show in order to destress,"" says Martine Bell, a nurse practitioner.

Dr. Bontempo, 50, poses for a photograph after a nine-hour shift. ""I'm used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It's very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That's the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time,"" said Bontempo. Laura Bontempo, an emergency medicine physician, says she removes her work clothing and gear in a decontamination tent she has set up outside her home, and then wraps herself in a towel and runs inside to shower. Then she puts the scrubs in the washing machine by themselves to not contaminate any other items.

Sheehan, 27, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what's going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we'll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients' lives,"" said Sheehan.",real

1664,152,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/health/coronavirus-immunity-antibodies.html,2020-03-25,Can You Become Immune to the Coronavirus?,"
As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than one billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus?
The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons.
People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the work force until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill.
Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat.
Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19.
On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.
“It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The body’s first line of defense against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria.
Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize and neutralize a specific virus.
The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response.
The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses — polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as well.
A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune.
Most people who became infected during the SARS epidemic — that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 — had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
Those who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr. Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.”
Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Even after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.
“You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,” Dr. Krammer said.
A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available.
Dr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers.
The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold.
If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr. Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at least somewhat effective against the new one.
The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.
Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West.
Last week, Dr. Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in “days to weeks,” he said.
The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the F.D.A.
Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists.
“No matter who makes them, as long as they’re reliable, that’s a super nice tool,” Dr. Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver “basically, a yes or no answer, like an H.I.V. test — you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn’t.”
On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said.
That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]“If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.
But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies.
Dr. Krammer’s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool.
Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill.
Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr. Le Sun.
Dr. Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei Province is being assessed.
This approach is actually “something very old-fashioned,” Dr. Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus.
Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins.
Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory.
Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune — and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.Reporting was contributed by Denise Grady.",real

During a recent webcast, O'Keefe discussed two stock picks he finds attractive in light of the market turmoil.

Southwest Airlines' strong balance sheet gives the carrier an edge over its peers, while UBS is better exposed to high-quality credit, he said.

Market crashes are no fun for the fund managers whose holdings shrink in value.

But for value investors specifically, every one of these episodes is an opportunity to find downtrodden companies that become much cheaper compared with their long-term prospects.

This is yet another reason that stock pickers like Daniel O'Keefe prefer their approach over the alternative that buys index and exchange-traded funds.

The Artisan International Value Fund he comanages looks for stocks the market is underpricing relative to their intrinsic or cash-flow-derived value. It has returned more than 6% over the past 15 years, double the performance of its category, according to Morningstar data.

In light of the coronavirus crisis and its impact on market valuations, O'Keefe singled out three of his holdings that have attractive value propositions.

For starters, he is not giving up on US airlines even after Warren Buffett, a godfather of value investing, liquidated his stake in the battered industry.

O'Keefe's fund first bought Southwest Airlines in the first quarter as the pandemic halted most travel. And as an indication of the low-cost carrier's ascendancy, its stock has held up better than every other US airline this year even though it is down 55%.

O'Keefe said one characteristic that should give Southwest an edge going forward is its balance sheet, which includes nearly $4 billion in cash.

""They have the enormous financial resources to survive what I think most people would agree is a temporary and anomalous situation,"" he said during a recent webcast hosted by Ariel Investments.

The airline's other advantages include its exclusively domestic itineraries and extensive network of low-cost flights, he added.

Not every airline with these characteristics may be able to survive the crisis. O'Keefe pointed to Boeing CEO David Calhoun' prediction that a major US airline could go bust this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""That will be of enormous benefit to Southwest,"" O'Keefe said, adding, ""They are in the best position to take market share when the others are clearly impaired.""

The second distinctive opportunity he identified is across the pond and in a completely different industry. UBS was the sixth-largest holding in his global value portfolio as of March 31.

He views it as a cheap stock that has undeservedly been painted with the same brush as the rest of the European banking industry.

""It's a wealth-management business,"" O'Keefe said. ""Yes, it has the investment bank. But it's a fairly de-risked investment bank over the last 10 years.""

He added that UBS as a whole did not have as much low-credit exposure as some of its peers. The majority of its credit exposure is to wealthy clients and includes so-called Lombard loans that are secured against a portfolio of liquid assets.

""If you don't want to own a bank, but you want to benefit from the undervaluation of banks, something like UBS is really interesting,"" O'Keefe said.",real

Less than two weeks later, on March 16, Carl's Golfland's two brick-and-mortar locations were effectively shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic

""My life flipped on the 5th of March,"" said Carl Rose Jr., ""and it flipped again on the 16th.""

The two life-altering dates forever will be intertwined, as far as Junior is concerned, especially as he tries to make the best of a situation that's been rotten for millions of businesses throughout the nation and world.

Carl's Golfland has kept all 180 of its employees on the payroll, and has donated more than $350,000 to hospitals and charities, mostly in Southeast Michigan, but also some nationally.

It's all part of Rose's #ShankThisVirus Campaign, which drew national notoriety Sunday when he got a shoutout on NBC during golf's return-to-live-action charity exhibition featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. On Sunday morning, given his long-standing relationship with event sponsor TaylorMade, Rose decided to add a $100,000 donation to the exhibition's purse.

""Mom and Dad started this in 1958, the year I was born, and Southeast Michigan and the country has been so good to my family and my business. I've been very, very fortunate,"" Rose said over the phone Tuesday. ""It just felt right to me. My mother and father, I know what type of people they were, and how they would look at this, and it just felt right to me. I wanted to try and make a difference.

""I started thinking about what Mom and Dad would do. They were very generous people, even when they were small.

""We've all gotta help each other.""

Carl's Golfland has two shops, in Bloomfield Hills and Plymouth, which are among the most acclaimed golf-apparel outfits in the country.

They do huge business, particularly in the spring months, as Michigan's estimated half-million recreational golfers gear up for the season.

This year, though, the shops suffered significant financial damages, with the stores being forced closed since mid-March. Rose and his staff installed curbside pickups for online sales, but that only made up for about 15 percent of the typical business. It's popular Demo Days were canceled.

Only recently has Carl's Golfland been allowed to open its ranges and its fitting stations, and give lessons.

But Rose still made the commitment to keep his staff, and fund the charity, which in Michigan has helped Gleaners Food Bank, Detroit Public Safety Foundation, Henry Ford Health System, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital, Hurley Medical Center, DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, SAY Detroit and the American Red Cross, plus a couple initiations outside the state, including the New York City Fire Department Foundation and The Beacon in Houston.

The donation during the NBC broadcast of the golf exhibition — one of the first live televised sporting events since mid-March, joining NASCAR, which returned Sunday — supports the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation.

""We're banged up, we're bruised, and it's gonna be a while until we're not,"" Rose said. ""This is something that's gonna have repercussions for years to come.

""You get one bruise and that heals up, and you've got another one. But I think we're gonna be one of the lucky ones. My heart bleeds for many people in our country, businesses you know aren't gonna come back.""

Golfers can purchase a #ShankThisVirus t-shirt at carlsgolfland.com, with all proceeds — the entire $18 cost of the shirt — going to charity, thanks to Carl's Golfland, founded by Carl and Donna Rose as a small driving range in Pontiac.

1681,639,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/6/21249524/justices-wary-obamacare-birth-control-coverage-changes-donald-trump-contraceptive-coronavirus,2020-05-06,Justices wary of ‘Obamacare’ birth control coverage changes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court seemed concerned Wednesday about the sweep of Trump administration rules that would allow more employers who cite a religious or moral objection to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women as required by the Affordable Care Act.

The justices were hearing their third day of arguments conducted by telephone because of the coronavirus pandemic. The first of two cases before them Wednesday stemmed from the Obama-era health law, under which most employers must cover birth control as a preventive service, at no charge to women, in their insurance plans.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced it would broaden an exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement that previously applied to houses of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques. But the change was blocked by courts.

The Supreme Court’s four liberal justices suggested they were troubled by the changes, which the government has estimated would cause about 70,000 women, and at most 126,000 women, to lose contraception coverage in one year.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a key vote on a court split between conservatives and liberals, suggested that the Trump administration’s reliance on a federal religious freedom law to expand the exemption was “too broad.”

And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who joined the conversation from a Maryland hospital where she was being treated for an infection caused by a gallstone, gave the government’s top Supreme Court lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Franciso, what sounded like a lecture.

“You have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these .... services with no hassle, no cost to them,” said Ginsburg, who is expected to be in the hospital for a day or two.

The court’s conservative justices seemed more willing to side with the administration, with Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting the administration’s changes might be considered “within the bounds of reasonable.”

Beyond exempting churches, synagogues and mosques from the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Obama administration also created a way by which religiously affiliated organizations including hospitals, universities and charities could opt out of paying for contraception, but women on their health plans would still get no-cost birth control. Some groups complained the opt-out process itself violated their religious beliefs.

That opt-out process was the subject of a previous Supreme Court case, but the court, with only eight justices at the time because of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, didn’t decide the issue. It instead sent both sides back to see if they could work out a compromise.

That didn’t happen. “Is it really the case that there is no way to resolve those differences?” Roberts asked at one point.

After the Trump administration took over, officials announced a rule change that allows many companies and organization with religious or moral objections to opt out of covering birth control without providing an alternate avenue for coverage.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania challenged the rules in court, and a judge blocked them from going into effect. The judge found the Trump administration did not follow proper procedures for issuing the rules. An appeals court agreed, and the administration appealed to the Supreme Court to step in, as did the Little Sisters of the Poor. The order of Roman Catholic nuns had been instrumental in challenging the Obama administration rules.

But on Wednesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned why the Little Sisters of the Poor were even at the court because for a number of reasons they don’t have to provide contraceptive coverage. Sotomayor also referenced the coronavirus pandemic during her questioning, asking attorney Paul Clement, who was representing the nuns, whether an employer might be able to object to paying for a coronavirus vaccine. He said “no.”

Even though the Trump rules remain blocked, a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in June already allows most people who object to covering contraception to avoid doing so.

In the second case the justices heard Wednesday, political consultants and pollsters were among those asking the Supreme Court to strike down a federal law from 1991 that bars them from making robocalls to cellphones. The case only arose after Congress in 2015 created an exception in the law that allows the automated calls for collection of government debt.

The court wrestled with whether it could get rid of just the government-debt restriction or would have to invalidate the entire ban on cellphone robocalls. “No one wants robocalls on their cellphone,” Roberts said, though he typically votes for the challengers in free-speech cases.

The argument provided a light moment of the day when Justice Stephen Breyer got cut off when someone tried calling him. Breyer said after he rejoined the court’s arguments: “The telephone started to ring, and it cut me off the call and I don’t think it was a robocall.”",real

1688,58,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/3/12/21177227/broadway-coronavirus-theaters-new-york-close-dark-governor-andrew-cuomo,2020-03-12,Coronavirus: Broadway theaters forced to close by N.Y. governor,"NEW YORK — New York’s governor ordered all Broadway theaters to shut their doors in the face of ongoing coronavirus concerns, plunging into darkness one of the city’s most popular tourist attractions and causing turmoil in the run-up to the Tony Awards.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday banned gatherings of 500 or more in the city, effectively forcing the hand of Broadway producers who had previously said that Broadway would be “open for business” unless advised not to by the government.

Shows will resume the week of April 13, only 10 days before the official cut-off for eligibility for the Tony Awards. Cuomo said venues of under 500 can only be filled to half their capacity.

On Broadway, would-be theater attendees were turned away, some shaking their heads in disbelief. “I had been hoping to catch one but it’s all canceled,” said Quinn Heath, 24, who was visiting from Boston.

Closing all Broadway theaters for a month is unprecedented, said Laurence Maslon, an arts professor at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. “Nothing comes close to this amount of time ever.”

The move comes a day after Broadway’s two largest theater chains revealed that a part-time usher and security guard who worked at two theaters in recent days tested positive for COVID-19 and was under quarantine.

The pressure on Broadway to go dark steadily increased as other entertainment hubs shuttered, including Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Opera, the NBA, NHL, CinemaCon, Coachella and Major League Soccer.

Actors took to Twitter to share their sadness. “My heart is with all my friends and colleagues,” wrote Tony Award-nominee Judy Kuhn. “This is really bad for everyone who depends on the theater for their livelihoods.” Kerry Butler, a Tony-nominated star of “Beetlejuice,” said the shuttering ”is the right move to keep everyone safe.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Other theaters far from Broadway have closed their doors, including the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in California, which canceled or postponed all productions and programs through March 31. The 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle closed its doors, citing the state’s mandated cancellation of public gatherings. The 1,600-seat Curran Theater in San Francisco decided to scrap performances of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”

Broadway producers were cautious until now, with a wait-and-see approach for an industry that grossed $1.8 billion last season. The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, recommended that actors refrain from greeting fans at the stage door.

The league said it had increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting all public and backstage areas. It also added alcohol-based sanitizer dispensers for public use in the lobby of every theater.

Producers have been historically unwilling to cancel shows, which had an average paid admission last week of over $100. The last time they did so was in 2016, when a ban on travel in New York and the suspension of public transportation due to snow forced theater owners to cancel one day’s shows. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 darkened Broadway for four days and cost more than $8.5 million in lost revenue. Broadway theaters stayed open during the 1918 influenza epidemic.

Broadway is particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus because its audience skews older, thousands of people are packed into small seats for every show and the industry is dependent on tourism. Of the 14.8 million admissions in the 2018-2019 season, 65% were made by tourists — 46% from Americans outside New York and 19% from other countries.

Actors’ Equity Association, which represents more than 51,000 actors and stage managers nationwide, had urged officials and producers to consider the health and economic welfare of theater workers in their decision.

The shuttering of all 41 Broadway theaters will cause chaos to the spring theatrical calendar, which culminates in the Tony Awards on May 19. Several shows — including “Company,” “Caroline, Or Change,” “Diana” and “Mrs. Doubtfire” — had scheduled to open during the time when theaters are closed.

Maslon noted that many of the spring’s biggest shows were waiting to open and he saw no reason why the Broadway League wouldn’t adjust its eligibility date. “I think they have to extend the season,” he said.

Established shows will likely weather the storm better than one’s waiting to open. “If it’s ‘Lion King,’ they’ll just pick up where they left off. But for shows like ‘Diana’ or ‘Hangman’ or ‘Company,’ which are still in previews and still trying to figure it out, it’s going to be very complicated.”

Last week, attendance was actually higher than the previous week, but many believed that Broadway would not be able to avoid the effects of the outbreak forever, especially if school groups and tourists decided to skip New York in big numbers.",real

In hard-hit New York, for example, outdoor movie venues can show films starting on Friday, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

The loosened restrictions involve reopening ""certain businesses statewide which are low risk — landscaping, gardening, low-risk recreational activities like tennis, drive-in movie theaters,"" Cuomo said in briefing on Monday. ""Talk about going back to the future. Back to drive-in movie theaters — I'm OK with that, by the way.""

New York will reopen statewide certain low-risk businesses and recreational activities as of May 15. These include: -Landscaping and gardening

-Outdoor, low-risk recreational activities like tennis

-Drive-in movie theaters — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) May 11, 2020

The movie ""Trolls"" will be playing this weekend at the Fingerlakes Drive-In in Auburn, New York, roughly 30 miles from Syracuse, according to its owner, Paul Meyer, a commercial real estate developer who bought the business eight years ago and who estimates there are about 30 drive-ins across the state.

""Drive-ins by design are excellent places to go for social distancing,"" Meyer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""I expect we'll have a good season this year.""

In operation since 1947, the business is the oldest continuously operated drive-in theater in the state, said Meyer, who is still thinking through all the logistics of keeping patrons six feet apart at the concession stand and in lines for the bathroom. His three employees and customers will be required to wear masks, he said.

For now, the pandemic has had little impact on Meyer's drive-in, a seasonal business that would have been closed anyway when the shutdown order came into play in March. ""When COVID hit we were already closed as it was in the middle of winter time,"" he said.

There are 305 drive-in theaters around the U.S., with at least one in every state except for Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana and North Dakota, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association.

It's not the first time that drive-ins, which first appeared in the U.S. in the years following the Great Depression, have been touted as a refuge from disease. In the early 1950s, when the U.S. faced a major polio epidemic, the theaters sometimes pitched themselves as ""flu and polio protected,"" according to an account by Food and Wine.

""It's a responsibility on our side to be as safe as possible,"" Stephen Sauerbeck, owner of Sauerbeck Family Drive-In Theater in La Grange, Kentucky, told The New York Times. ""I don't want this to be, 'We found a loophole in the situation, and we are going to operate an underground business the government is trying to shut down.'""",real
1702,1617,https://humansarefree.com/2020/05/researchers-100-covid-19-cure-rate-using-intravenous-chlorine-dioxide.html,2020-05-21,Researchers: 100% Covid-19 Cure Rate Using Intravenous Chlorine Dioxide,"Preliminary data from a clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19 patients in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure rate within four days, according to Andreas Kalcker who is closely following the results of the effort.

The tests were carried out by the Asociacion Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine practitioners.

Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, and the current “standard of care” promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the use of ventilators — has been killing the vast majority of critical patients while utterly failing to address the real root of the problem.

Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it turns out.

Rather, it often presents as an inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia and eventual asphyxiation.

This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood cells — is believed to work so effectively against covid-19.

It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the lungs, all while destroying pathogens.

Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he explains the findings.

That video, entitled, “Mas de 100 Casos de Covid-19 recuperados con CDS por medicos de Aememi,” is found at this link on Lbry.tv.

A video embed is offered here:

In the video, Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve a complete cure in just four days through the use of intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2).

Here’s a photo of some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’ blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while killing pathogens:

Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is currently under way, documented by the US National Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov.

The study uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous) and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID 19.”

The trial is being conducted by the Genesis Foundation and involves 20 patients.

The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for that trial is NCT04343742.

Andreas Kalcker explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and bacteria.

The substance has long been used in water purification processes and is approved by various US government agencies for as a water treatment and purification agent.

This video frame shows blood cells being flooded with oxygen from ClO2, instantly reducing clotting / coagulation:

Covid-19 is not an acute respiratory disease

In another bombshell science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet, researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.

This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently killed by the use of ventilators.

As an ICU doctor from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating the wrong disease.

(That doctor’s YouTube channel was deleted and all his videos were censored, of course. No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the medical police state known as the United States of America.)

Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a worsening of the condition, which implies that anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to saving lives and ending the pandemic.

From the study:

The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis…

MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it is an inflammatory response stemming from an over-reactive immune response, similar to the “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which vitamin C helps prevent, according to published research). As the study explains:

The severity of systemic inflammation in response to human coronavirus family members has features reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).

Figure 1 from the study:

To simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather an inflammation-based immunological response that leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which kills the patient.

The use of ventilators only makes the problem worse, which is why previous observational studies have found that 88% of patients put on ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.

Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while killing the pathogens responsible for clotting.

There is also anecdotal evidence that some people are beating covid-19 infections with high doses of aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far more research is needed on blood thinners and anti-inflammatory interventions.

This may also help explain why turmeric and vitamin D are associated with strong reductions in inflammation in the body, which may prove useful in balancing the immune response and preventing the kind of imbalance that can lead to immune system overreactions.

The criminal medical cartels are censoring all treatments and cures that work to save lives

Notably, the criminal Big Pharma cartels and corrupt government regulators (like the FDA, FTC, CDC) are going out of their way to try to criminalize or suppress any non-vaccine, non-pharma solutions that might save lives.

Over the last month, we’ve all witnessed an astonishing level of aggression and mafia-style tactics used by the FDA and FTC against pioneering researchers offering a variety of possible solutions, such as chlorine dioxide or intravenous vitamin C.

They’ve even declared war on hydroxychloroquine and the medical establishment has been engineering clinical trials which are designed to fail from the start in order to discredit the off-patent, affordable drug.

There is no doubt that Big Pharma’s obedient government lackeys are at war with truth and are desperately trying to suppress information about natural cures and integrative treatments that might eliminate covid-19 before vaccines can be made available.

The techno-fascist tech giants like Facebook, Google, Vimeo, YouTube and Twitter are all-in with Big Pharma, going out of their way to censor and destroy all information that criticizes vaccines or offers wisdom about natural treatments or integrative medicine interventions.

This criminal cabal of Big Tech and Big Pharma is the enemy of humanity, as they are deliberately working to worsen the pandemic, increase suffering and death and extend the punishing lockdowns for as long as possible in order to cause several economic damage while preparing the masses for mandatory vaccines.

We are all witnessing a powerful criminal gang of corporations and regulators who are deliberately seeking to destroy human society as we know it today, and they are the gatekeepers of information on the ‘net (and in the news).

[The internet was perfectly fine before the powers that shouldn’t be decided to destroy it. Now censorship and propaganda are rampant online, and Google and YouTube searches are no longer relevant since they promote the dinosaur media lies rather than delivering the actual search trends, as they used to. The MSM is shoved down our throats even deeper, while independent researchers are delisted, etc.]

This is why we are repeating our call for the CEOs of all the top tech giants to be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity, then prosecuted in a court of law.

Over the weekend, a member of Italy’s Parliament gave a rousing speech in which she labeled Bill Gates a “vaccine criminal” and demanded he be arrested and charged with crimes against humanity.

Such efforts should not be limited to Bill Gates, however. They must include the criminals of other tech giants as well as the corrupt, anti-human criminals running the FDA, FTC and CDC, among others.

Their crimes against humanity must not go unanswered, and they must be held accountable in a court of law.

The destructive, anti-human agendas of Big Pharma and Big Tech are incompatible with human freedom and a sustainable human civilization.

These anti-human institutions must be permanently dismantled, and humanity must rise up against this threat in the same way we once awakened against the Third Reich and the rise of Nazi fascism and the Holocaust.

Right now, Big Pharma, Big Tech, the FDA and the CDC are plotting to kill billions of human beings with an engineered bioweapon, a risky vaccine, and high-fatality prescription drugs that make people more vulnerable to covid-19.

These enemies of humanity must be stopped, and the truth about chlorine dioxide must be set free so that human beings can be saved from suffering and death.

To learn more about the establishment’s war on truth (and war on humanity), watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits, who has also been subjected to extreme censorship for raising the alarm about how vaccines are spreading infectious disease.

Research in the UK are offering about $4500 in exchange for two weeks in a secure London facility that has a TV, Playstation gaming, WiFi, and a private bathroom to those who volunteer to be infected.

24 human volunteers are being sought after to infect with coronavirus strains 229E and OC43, while they are similar to COVID-19 they only cause a mild respiratory illness. Once infected a research team will be collecting samples such as nasal and blood, and all dirty tissues will be collected by a trained medical staff to assess the viral load.

Those who volunteer to be human test subjects will be closely monitored 24/7 for symptoms, the researchers will control your diet, and you will be barred from exercising as well as having contact with the outside world along with being confined to your room for two weeks. Along with feeling pretty miserable you will probably be able to get a good gaming or movie binge going, but that’s about it.

This study is part of the mega bucks race to find a cure or vaccine for the current outbreak of COVID-19 which is continuing to spread infection and accumulate a death toll. The company that owns the lab is called Hvivo and they also run clinical trials to find cures for cold and flu offering about $100/day for volunteers with similar perks.

Here are the 5 things they're most worried about.,"Analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus.

The experts were particularly worried about regional testing disparities and eased lockdowns.

They said we still have a lot to learn, like how to do contact tracing at scale.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Last week, analysts at SVB Leerink interviewed three experts in infectious disease immunology, epidemiology, and public health about ""back to normal"" strategies in the US.

The conversation reveals how many questions remain unanswered about the novel coronavirus and how it can be stopped — from basic, disease-specific concerns like symptoms and transmission, to testing complications and herd immunity, according to a summary the analysts, led by Geoffrey Porges, sent investors.

In the US, COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed nearly 80,000 people and is leading to strange complications in children that scientists still don't understand. Meanwhile, even in the fourth month of US outbreaks, confusion persists about how new testing methodologies and treatments will be deployed.

The experts, who were not identified by SVB Leerink, were particularly worried about rural and urban disparities in testing the effects as stay-at-home orders are lifted, according to the summary.

One expert is ""deeply worried"" that the US will return back to where it started, as the positive test rate is still high in several areas that plan to loosen restrictions, according to the summary.

The experts ""are concerned that once the social distance measures are relaxed there will be a surging number of infected cases,"" the Leerink analysts wrote.

New York is looking to partially reopen starting May 15, based on a set of criteria used to evaluate outbreaks at the local level. Similarly, California released reopening guidelines last week for counties and businesses.

Meanwhile, testing and tracing capabilities as a whole ""still seem shorthanded,"" particularly in rural areas, according to the experts. As reported by The Atlantic last week, the US needs to double or triple its daily testing, but the federal government has no plans to support that increase.

The experts also believe further research is required to address a number of questions about COVID-19's manifestation, duration of immunity, and the role of children in its transmission.

Here are 5 key takeaways from the report.

The role of children in transmission is still unknown

It's still not clear whether children play a major role in coronavirus transmission, according to the experts. For other respiratory diseases like the flu, children are known to be ""major drivers for community transmission,"" the report said.

But in those cases, children tend to develop severe symptoms compared to their adult counterparts, which isn't true for COVID-19. Meanwhile, such a small group of symptomatic coronavirus cases in children makes them difficult to study, the experts told SVB Leerink.

Contact tracing is a method by which public health officials work with a sick patient to find everyone they've come into contact with. One expert told Leerink that the logic is straightforward, but the logistics are not.

For 100 coronavirus cases per day, for example, and 10-15 contacts for each case, up to 300 tracing workers with 40-hour work weeks are needed, according to the summary. States like New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are all planning to hire or hiring contact tracers, they said.

Still a long way to national testing

Testing underpins all other health and economic measures meant to combat the virus, the experts told SVB Leerink. Today, it's not coordinated at a national level, leading to ""significant variability"" among different geographic regions, according to the report.

Until testing infrastructure is ""formalized,"" country-wide reopening will be problematic, they said.

Current coronavirus tests aren't always accurate

The US Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to get faulty antibody tests off the market, but their accuracy is still wide-ranging. One expert pointed out that tests relying on pinpricks tend to perform worse than those relying on blood draws analyzed in laboratories.

Mitigation efforts alone will not end the pandemic

While social distancing helps, and more people could potentially gain immunity, the only thing that will truly stop the virus in its tracks is a vaccine, according to the experts.

""We will ultimately need vaccination (or a large number of infection cases) in combination with social distancing to contain spread and allow some return to our usual activities,"" the summary said.",real

The move is part of an attempt to reduce operating expenses by $100 million the year, and the company plans to reduce non-headcount related operating expenses to $250 million in 2021. GoPro added that its founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman, will not be paid a salary for the remainder of the year, and that the company will shift more towards a direct-to-consumer sales model going forward.

The restructuring comes as GoPro has started to recover after its ill-fated move into the drone market. Released in late 2016 after several delays, the GoPro Karma was a basic drone that failed to impress, and GoPro ended up quitting the drone business just over a year later. Last year, there were signs the company had shaken off the pain of the move off the back of the success of the Hero 7.

GoPro says it sold 700,000 cameras in the first quarter and expects its 2020 product and service roadmap to be unaffected by operational cuts, according to Bloomberg.

How those supplies are used is crucial, experts say.Based on current evidence, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is most frequently transmitted between people via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.
For the general public, basic preventive measures include keeping a safe distance of 1 to 2 metres, washing hands with soap for 20 seconds or using a hand sanitiser, wearing a face mask if crowded situations cannot be avoided and not touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth.
In hospitals and other frontline medical scenarios, however, the guidelines are much more complex - and the personal protective equipment (PPE) much more robust.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued specific recommendations for these situations, aimed at both protecting workers and preserving gear for where it is needed most.

Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.

The commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.

“We have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,” the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. “However, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.”

The commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government. Harris and Sims said they still hope to pass ethics reform legislation in the spring legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 31. But since lawmakers have not met since March 5 – and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30 — that could become increasingly difficult.

Before the pandemic altered the landscape, Pritzker declared that ending corruption was a priority. In his State of the State speech in January, the governor said the state must “root out the purveyors of greed and corruption — in both parties — whose presence infects the bloodstream of government.”

A wide-ranging federal investigation targeting state lawmakers and other politicians prompted the latest push.

In September, federal officials raided the offices of state Sen. Martin Sandoval. The Southwest Side Democrat pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January.

In October, state Rep. Luis Arroyo was charged with bribery. The former Northwest Side Democratic legislator’s case is still ongoing. Earlier last year, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, D-Villa Park, was indicted in August for allegedly embezzling money from the Teamsters.

While Republican lawmakers wanted to tackle corruption in the fall veto session last November, Democrats opted to form the commission to study the issue first and to release a report on what reforms are needed.",real

Lobbyists are virtually descending on official Washington to try to gather as much as they can of the government's ongoing coronavirus relief packages.

Companies and interest groups — many of them new to the lobbying world — are competing for loans and other forms of financial help.

The Center for Responsive Politics tracks money spent in U.S. politics. Sheila Krumholz, the organization's executive director, talked with All Things Considered about the boom in lobbying for coronavirus relief. Here is some of that interview:

I'm curious what industries you've noticed are hiring lobbyists for the first time now.

About three-fourths of the new registrations sent for the last month have cited COVID and are by companies that are either new to lobbying or haven't lobbied in recent years. And about a third of those are for health care companies. ...

There are some related to education which aren't so typical, but lots of travel and tourism, gaming and entertainment, and retail and manufacturing, kind of what you would expect to see at this time.

Lobbying is traditionally face-to-face, it's this incremental process. What does that process look like now when everyone's working remotely and when the legislative process is so much more accelerated?

Like the rest of us, the lobbyists on K Street have had to pivot from in-person meetings to phone and video calls and emails. Not ideal when you're trying to sell a policy to Congress that needs quick information. But lobbyists can provide that if their calls are answered. So that's where the revolving door networks are really important. There are short time frames and the lack of in-person contact makes getting your call taken critical.

Have you spotted any examples of industries that are using this pandemic opportunistically, like to get something now that they have fought for in the past but couldn't get before?

Oh, absolutely. The bigger groups with lots of lobbying experience are adept at repackaging their existing agenda. It would be urgent and worthy of relief even when those items have been on the wish list for a long time. So hotels get a tax break they've been pushing for since 2017. Big banks have pushed for deregulation they've long wanted. Tech has pushed for delays in privacy laws and changes for gig workers. So that's being kind of mushed into the package.

There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.

Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.

Illinois officials announced Thursday that the statewide case total has increased to 87,937 while the death tally closes in on 4,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration recently warned that projections show the state could see 50-150 deaths per day into June or later.

In addition to Queens, six other New York counties have been among the top ten nationwide for coronavirus case totals, while the next highest Illinois county — Lake — was No. 49 in the nation as of Wednesday with 5,662 cases.

Facing calls from some local leaders growing impatient with his phased plan to reopen regions of the state, Pritzker said “this virus is still among us.

“This pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we’ve lost will only make this last longer.”",real

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Negin Kamali said 170 employees are currently aboard the ship bound for Port Dickson, Malaysia, ""to finalize crew repatriation efforts and remain until operations begin."" Details about crew members' nationalities and repatriation details were not immediately available.

The ship had been docked in Japan since early February, where officials attempted to quarantine its 3,700 passengers and crew for two weeks after 10 initial coronavirus cases were reported Feb. 4.

Eventually, 712 people who had been on the ship tested positive, and 13 died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. By mid-February, it was the largest coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the pandemic is believed to have begun in December.

Around 400 American citizens were evacuated on two State Department charter flights in late February, including 14 who had tested positive. Public health experts have widely criticized the quarantine and the subsequent evacuation for worsening the outbreak.

""The quarantine process failed,"" Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told the USA TODAY editorial board in February. ""I'd like to sugarcoat it and try to be diplomatic about it, but it failed.""

Another coronavirus outbreak in early March on the Grand Princess and a growing global crisis led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships March 14. The no-sail order was extended and is in force through late July.

The Diamond Princess has lingered in Japan in the meantime. Kamali said the ship left Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday.

About 200 employees replaced mattresses, bedding, linens and room ornaments as part of a sanitation and refurbishment project while the ship was docked at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Dockyard and Machinery Works.

Kamali said Japan home port cruises on the Diamond Princess have been canceled through Oct. 1. Princess said earlier this month that it would cancel cruises through the end of the summer season, citing the reduction in flight schedules and the closure of cruise ship ports.",real

You'll also have to agree to a temperature check and may have to wait in line outside as the company curbs the number of people in its stores. Some locations will offer curbside pickup or storefront only.

Each retail location will undergo “enhanced deep cleanings” throughout the day in a bid to sanitize heavily touched services and cut down the risk of contagion. Apple warns that it could start to close its doors again if coronavirus cases start to spike or lockdown orders in certain areas are reenacted.

1747,402,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/swedens-approach-dealing-covid-19/,2020-04-22,Sweden’s Approach To Dealing With COVID-19,"Ander Tegnell the epidemiologist behind the country’s controversial strategy recently had an interview with Nature to explain the “trust based” approach to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak, the following is an excerpt of that interview:

Much of the world has imposed severe restrictions on public life in recent months to try and slow the spread of this virus, among them there is one country standing out from the crowd: Sweden. In this country there is no lock down or strict social distancing policies. Rather this country has imposed a voluntary trust based measure that advises those who are older or with existing conditions to avoid social contact; it recommends people work from home, wash their hands regularly, and people should avoid non-essential travel.

Another more glaring difference is that in Sweden the borders and schools for children under the age of 16 remain open, as do many businesses including bars and restaurants. Their unique approach is gaining attention from critics among whom 22 scientists wrote an article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter that public health authorities are failing and they urged politicians to step in an impose stricter measures pointing to a high number of deaths in elder care homes and the overall fatality rate which is the highest reported of the Nordic neighbours.

Ander Tegnell is an epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency in Sweden and is the architect behind their strategy who suggests that it is overstated how unique their approach is, as they too are aiming to flatten the curve to slow down the spread as much as possible as to not collapse the healthcare system.

Tegnell says this is not a disease that can be stopped or eradicated, as such there needs to be long term solutions that keep the distribution of infections at a decent level. Every country is trying to keep people apart by using the same measures and traditions, and this is one of the reasons they ended up doing things slightly different.

The laws on communicable diseases are mostly based on voluntary measures in Sweden, falling on an individual’s own responsibility, clearly stating that each citizen has the responsibility to not spread a disease. In Sweden using their present laws there is not much legal possibility to close down cities, a quarantine can be contemplated for people or small areas such as a hotel or a school but they legally are not able to lock down an entire geographical area.

In his view closing borders, lock downs and close downs have nothing to do with historical scientific basis, when they were investigating European countries to examine published analysis of the effects of these measures almost none were found. Thus in his opinion closing borders is ridiculous because COVID-19 is in every country now, and they have more concerns about movements inside of Sweden. In order to be effective those measures needed to be implemented immediately to be effective, as once it has spread it is too late.

In Sweden as a society they are more into nudging and continuously reminding people to use safety measures, working to improve measures as they are seen to need to be adjusted day to day, and there is no need to close everything down completely because it would be counterproductive.

Every morning the Swedish Public Health Agency meets to review and update decisions and adjust recommendations as needed according to data collection and analysis, talking to regional authorities twice a week.

Currently the big debate is regarding elder care homes where the country is registering a very unfortunate outbreak of the coronavirus which largely accounts for Sweden’s higher death rate as compared to the Nordic neighbors. To better understand which recommendations are not being followed and why not investigations are ongoing to make adjustments to try and correct the situation.

Although the country is being criticized for being too relaxed and possibly putting citizen lives at risk Tegnell does not believe there is that risk. Public health officials have released a detailed model on a region by region basis that comes to less pessimistic conclusions than that of other researchers in terms of hospitalizations and deaths per thousand infections. While there has been an increase in cases it is not traumatic so far, he says adding that the country is currently in a phase where there will be more cases during the next few weeks, just as every country either has or will experience, and nowhere in Europe has the spread been able to be slowed down considerably.

According to Tegnell the science does not support closing down schools at this point. In an epidemic to get an effect you have to shut things such as schools down early, and we are now close to the top of the curve so closing down schools would be meaningless at this point. It makes more sense along with being more instrumental for psychiatric and physical health that the younger generation remains active.

While there is a possibility asymptomatics are contagious, the amount of spread is mostly likely small compared to those showing symptoms as in the normal distribution of a bell curve asymptomatics sit at the margin whereas the majority of the curve is accountable to symptomatics which are the ones we really need to stop, says Tegnell.

Tegnell says that it is too early to know if their approach will be successful. Every country needs to reach herd immunity in one way or another, and Sweden is going to reach it in a different way. Some argue that keeping people in quarantine will limit their exposure and hault developing natural immunity needed to develop herd immunity. Just as the common cold or flu we once had no immunity, and many people died, which is the same as with this virus. Herd immunity is when a high proportion of the population becomes immune to an infection which largely limits the spread to those who are not immune, and quarantine undermines this process. According to Tegnell there are enough signals to show that we can think about herd immunity for this virus, how long it will last is unknown, but there is a definite immune response.

Tegnell believes that they underestimated the issues that would arise at elder care homes, and how the measures would or in this case would not be applied, and they should have controlled this more thoroughly in these communities.

Thus far he is satisfied with this strategy, and most of the problems the country is facing at the moment are not because of the disease, rather because the recommended measures in some environments have not been applied properly such as the deaths among older people which is a huge problem they are trying to fight hard against.

Looking at pandemics there are far worse scenarios than this one, Tegnell has data showing that the flu epidemic and winter norovirus dropped consistently this year which means that the social distancing and hand washing recommendations are working. Tracking models show that the movements in Swedes has fallen dramatically, and the voluntary strategy is having a real effect, adds Tegnell.",fake

The motion also calls for bringing in the county’s auditor-controller to ensure closer monitoring of skilled nursing facilities immediately. The inspector general would be tasked with developing recommendations on how to strengthen oversight for skilled nursing facilities, and how to improve their operations long-term, according to a statement.

Many skilled nursing homes get low marks for quality of care, patient satisfaction, and employee pay, the statement noted.

The Board of Supervisors will vote on the motion at their next meeting on Tuesday.

“While some skilled nursing homes may be doing their best to respond to COVID-19, we’ve seen hundreds of deaths at these facilities, tragically exposing the urgent need for stronger oversight across the industry,” Ridley-Thomas said. “Now, more than ever, we must act to address any questionable operations and substandard conditions in the facilities that care for some of our most vulnerable residents — the elderly, the low-income and the disabled.”

Barger added: “Skilled nursing facilities provide critical care and support for many of our most vulnerable populations. As the County fights the COVID-19 public health crisis, we must greatly improve our ability to assess and oversee these facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of all those who have been entrusted to their care.”

Skilled nursing facilities, which serve thousands of residents who tend to be older and medically fragile, have become the epicenter of L.A. County’s COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 18, 4,794 residents and 2,918 staff from these facilities have tested positive for the virus. Across L.A. County, 52 percent of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in institutional settings, particularly in skilled nursing facilities.

The L.A. County Department of Health Services director, Dr. Christina Ghaly, said that “It is our collective responsibility to protect and support the most vulnerable among us. Prioritizing the health and safety of those in our County’s skilled nursing facilities is the right thing to do and will also help protect the availability of hospital resources for all those who need them.”

The Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion says it is “critical that L.A. County learn the lessons of this crisis; identify the internal and external factors that have contributed to inadequate conditions within skilled nursing facilities; and provide oversight, accountability and resources as needed.”

They described the proposed inspector general as a ‘much-needed accountability measure” appointed to conduct an exhaustive review of L.A. County’s capacity to regulate skilled nursing facilities, recommend structural and operational changes, and outline a plan for ensuring adequate and sustainable oversight. They also plan to task the inspector general with recommending regulatory and policy improvements at the local, state and federal levels to enhance quality of care, ensuring adequate infection control measures, and supporting healthcare workers.

To increase transparency, the Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion also called for directing the L.A. County auditor-controller to take the lead in designing a publicly accessible dashboard with information about COVID-19 case totals, testing frequency, mitigation plan status, and other information. The motion seeks to find ways to enhance L.A. County’s ability to assess the adequacy of mitigation plans and to oversee their implementation.

Skilled nursing facilities have also received close attention from L.A. City government. Under an emergency order issued Friday by Mayor Eric Garcetti, skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles will be required to provide diagnostic testing for COVID-19 for their employees, residents and contractors.

Nursing facilities, senior living homes and other facilities that care for people 65 and older have been potential “death traps,” Garcetti said.

Garcetti said the facilities can request assistance with testing from the city’s Emergency Operations Center if they’re unable to obtain it themselves. The tests will be required to be administered at least once a month.",real

This one can gobble like Pac-Man,"OR YEHUDA, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli inventors have developed a coronavirus mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat food without taking it off, a device they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.

A squeeze of a lever, much like a cyclist operates a handbrake, opens a slot in the front of the mask so that food can pass through.

The process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up in a flash a la Pac-Man in the arcade game.

“The mask will be opened mechanically by hand remote or automatically when the fork is coming to the mask,” Asaf Gitelis, vice president of Avtipus Patents and Inventions, said on Monday as he demonstrated the device at its offices near Tel Aviv.

“Then you can eat, enjoy, drink and you take out the fork and it will be closed, and you’re protected against the virus and other people sitting with you.”

The company said it plans to start manufacturing the mask within months and had already submitted a patent. It said it would likely sell at a 3 to 10 shekel ($0.85 to $2.85) premium above the price of the simple pale blue medical masks many Israelis wear.

Outside a Juice Bar in Tel Aviv, Reuters showed customers a cellphone video of the mask in action. Opinion was divided.

“I think this mask, that enables me to eat while I’m still wearing it, is a must-have,” said Ofir Hameiri, a 32-year-old graduate student.

But eating an ice cream cone, Ron Silberstein, a 29-year-old musician, said: “I don’t think this mask could hold this kind of ice cream - it’s dripping all over. I wouldn’t want to wear it afterward.”

Israel has largely reopened its economy after a dramatic drop in cases of the novel coronavirus. Restaurants are open only for takeout for the time being.

The report, produced by Swiss company IQAir, pulls together government data from Delhi, London, Los Angeles, Milan, Mumbai, New York City, São Paulo, Seoul, Wuhan, and Rome.

Places typically choked with worse air pollution saw the most extreme drops

Places typically choked with worse air pollution saw the most extreme drops in fine particulate matter, or soot. Delhi saw a 60 percent reduction in pollution over a three-week period while its stay-at-home order took effect, compared to the same period last year. Seoul, South Korea, saw a 54 percent decrease. Soot in Wuhan, China, dropped by 44 percent.

IQAir manufactures air purifiers and pollution monitors but also maintains online air quality maps. An interactive real-time map — a collaboration between IQAir and United Nations environmental and sustainability programs — provides information about the air quality index across major cities, along with a ranking of where air pollution is worst.

The data backs up previous observations of how the air has cleared up during the pandemic as nonessential businesses shut down and planes, trains, and cars emptied. NASA shared maps in early March depicting a dramatic drop in China of another pollutant pumped out by tailpipes that inflames airways, nitrogen dioxide. NASA similarly saw a 30 percent reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions over the Northeast United States in March.

Rome was the only one of the 10 cities that actually saw an increase in soot over the three-week period. More people using their heating systems at home could be one culprit for poorer air quality, according to the report.

Cleaner air is a welcome reprieve during a pandemic caused by a virus that affects the lungs, but it’s not forecast to last. Air pollution is expected to rebound after restrictions set during the pandemic loosen. Similar rebounds have been observed with air quality and greenhouse gas emissions after other economic shocks like the 2008 recession.",real

""The US State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 advanced technology heavyweight torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday,"" Reuters reported Wednesday. What will happen next as tensions rise with China?

Venezuela and Iran, two countries that the US has decided to make adversaries, and which have been ""stung by sanctions and hobbled by the coronavirus, are forging a closer strategic partnership, providing embattled President Nicolás Maduro a vital lifeline and offering Tehran the prospect of a new center of influence just across the Caribbean Sea from Florida,"" the Washington Post reported Friday. ""The most public display of the deepening relationship: five oil tankers now steaming across the Atlantic Ocean to Venezuela, carrying what analysts estimate to be 60 million gallons of Iranian gasoline ... The first of the ships is set to arrive in Venezuelan waters as soon as this weekend, to relieve fuel shortages so dire that the sick can’t get to hospitals and produce is rotting on farms."" How will the US react to this as the ships get closer to Venezuela?

US President Donald Trump continues to attack China for what he describes as ""worldwide killing"" from COVID-19. This message is likely to be relevant in the 2020 US presidential campaign. ""The White House salvos have sought to keep a focus on China's early response to the virus and what Trump has called a 'China-centric' deference at the World Health Organization. China, in turn, has portrayed itself as a good global citizen willing to work with the United Nations and other countries to defeat the pandemic,"" the Washington Post reported Thursday.

In David Lindorff's recent piece for RT, titled ""COVID-19 is massacring US elderly in nursing homes, neglected for years by a power-hungry industry,"" he states, ""The elderly in US care institutions are dying disproportionately from COVID-19. The pandemic has revealed the extent to which their wellbeing and safety have been sacrificed by an industry that prioritizes profit and influence.” How is this happening?

""America’s billionaires have seen their wealth increase by 12.5 percent during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), a Washington, DC-based think tank, released a study Thursday showing that, in the eight weeks between March 18 and May 14, the country’s super-wealthy have added a further $368.8 billion to their already enormous fortunes,"" Alan MacLeod wrote in a May 15 MintPress News article. All this comes at the same time that the economy has undeniably imploded for working people. MacLeod's article continues: ""A record 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance, with millions more losing their employer-based health care plans, and around a third of the country not paying its rent. Schools, factories, offices, and other businesses remain shuttered. The Trump administration has promised to provide $1,200 to every citizen, but it will be months before everyone receives their check. As a result, there has been an explosion in the use of food banks, as desperate citizens line up for hours in the hopes of receiving a box of food.""

""The US has rejected wording in a World Health Organization resolution that backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents in order to gain access to a COVID-19 vaccine or treatment,"" the Financial Times reported this week. ""Washington dissociated itself Tuesday from elements of a motion passed by WHO members, saying that it sent 'the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs.' Many governments, particularly in Africa, fear they will be squeezed out by richer countries unless they can force companies that discover anti-COVID-19 therapies to share their intellectual property with manufacturers able to produce them cheaply at scale.""

Get ready to wait.,"© HEATHER KHALIFA/The Philadelphia Inquirer/TNS Volunteers grab absentee ballot applications to stuff into food boxes distributed by the city, school district, and nonprofit groups in Philadelphia on May 16, 2020.

It’s a familiar election night routine: Polls close, and everyone wants to know who won — immediately. Every minute matters for Americans anxiously awaiting the results. News organizations race to meet the demand by using complex statistical models to “call"" the winner long before all the votes are counted.

But get comfortable waiting: Instant electoral gratification is about to become a thing of the past.

A new Pennsylvania law that allows any voter to cast a ballot by mail, along with a surge in requests for mail-in ballots driven by fears of voting in person during the coronavirus pandemic, has set up a 2020 election in which everyone could be left waiting for days before results are known.

That might not bother the public much when it comes to the June 2 primary, with a Democratic presidential contest that has already been effectively decided. But when President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden face off in the fall, and all eyes turn to the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, delays could effectively leave the race for the White House in limbo for days.

“If nothing changes before November, I would bet my house there would be no way anybody could responsibly call the presidential race [on election night],” said Forrest Lehman, elections director for Lycoming County, in central Pennsylvania.

The new law, which also changes how and when mail-in votes are counted, already stood to wreak havoc on the public’s expectation for quick results.

“No county wants to be the reason we don’t know the leader of the free world on election night,” Lee Soltysiak, Montgomery County’s chief operating officer and clerk of its election board, said in January. “And that’s the position, depending on the margin, we’re all likely to be in.”

Read our January story: Pennsylvania’s presidential election could be too close to call for days because of a new lawThen the coronavirus hit. The number of polling places are being cut. Requests for mail ballots have gone through the roof.

Soltysiak laughed when reminded of what he said in January.

“We’re not in a better place,” he said this week. “All of the challenges that we’re preparing to face still exist — and we have layered on top of them those that go along with volume and the pandemic.”

Every election night, news outlets try to project winners using unofficial results from precincts, surveys of voters leaving polling places, turnout data, and more. (Official results aren’t certified until weeks later.)

But some of that modeling depends on people voting in person, and data from past elections will be less useful this year now that Pennsylvania has changed how they are run. Not to mention that voter behavior is harder to predict during a pandemic. The crisis also means it will take even longer than expected to count mail ballots, county elections officials said.

Philadelphia elections officials, for example, expect mail ballots to make up a majority of the vote, and they won’t even start counting them until the day after the election. Several large counties, including Bucks, Chester, and Montgomery, plan to start counting absentee ballots on election day, but expect to take at least another day or two before finishing.

Christine Reuther, a Delaware County councilwoman, said “it would be unreasonable for people to expect results” from her county before Saturday.

Four days after the election.

The only silver lining for the primary, officials said, is that Biden and Trump are all but assured to win their party nominations, which could lower turnout and the number of mail ballots to count.

But that might also obscure the magnitude of the problem looming in November, when millions will anxiously await the results from Pennsylvania.

“We don’t have any choice at this point but to take our lumps on June 2 and then learn lessons from it and apply them forward,” Lehman said.

“That’s the only hope I have,” he added. “But I don’t have a whole lot of it.”

The new waiting game

The time it takes to count ballots isn’t a sign of fraud, corruption, or any other failure of the electoral system. Rather, it’s a direct result of reforms to help expand access to voting.

In the past, the vast majority of votes were cast in person. Pennsylvania had one of the most restrictive absentee voting systems in the country, and only about 5% of votes in any election were cast by mail. So when polling places sent results back to county elections offices, they accounted for almost all the votes.

The new law enacted last year changes that.

It was a bipartisan move to make voting more flexible and convenient. It will also dramatically increase the number of mail ballots. (Due to a quirk in the law, Pennsylvania technically has two kinds of mail ballots, “absentee” and “mail-in,” that are functionally the same for voters.)

Philly will have way fewer polling places for next month’s primary because of coronavirus. Find yours here.Mail ballots also take much longer to count than in-person votes. Physical voting machines keep track of votes as they are cast and spit out a summary at the end of the night. But mail ballots require opening two different envelopes and then scanning the paper ballots. And some ballots need to be counted by hand, either due to voter error or problems with scanners.

“It will definitely not be same-night election results that people are used to. We will certainly be well into the next day,"" said Gail Humphrey, the chief clerk for Bucks County. “Those scanners can jam.”

“If there’s absolutely nothing that happens by technology that we didn’t foresee,” she said, “we’ll still be at least, bare minimum, into the next day still counting.”

Coronavirus adds to the challenge

The pandemic led to a volume of mail ballot requests that is far exceeding officials’ expectations. As of Wednesday, Pennsylvania voters had sent in almost 1.6 million applications for mail ballots, far exceeding the total of 107,000 in the 2016 primary.

That means a significant strain on counties to actually tally them, just as social distancing guidelines make gathering workers to do so that much harder.

“The number of people you’re going to have being able to canvass, or to open up envelopes even, at an eight-foot table is pretty much one. And one at the next table,” said Randall O. Wenger, chief clerk of the Lancaster County Board of Elections. “It’s going to impact and slow down that process as well.”

“I don’t have any delusion that we’re going to have [all the ballots] opened and scanned and adjudicated that same day,"" Wenger said. ""Not going to happen.”

Philly voters have requested more mail ballots than all of Pennsylvania did in 2016Counties also have to figure out how many people they can even dedicate to counting ballots, given how messy in-person voting at polling places is likely to be. In Philadelphia, which will have 77% fewer polling places this year, elections staff will be too busy to count mail ballots, said Lisa Deeley, chair of the City Commissioners, who run elections.

“It’s unrealistic to think I’m going to have people to go sit and count ballots,” she said. “Election day is going to be quite the challenge, and it’s going to pretty much take up all our bandwidth on election day.”

Things could be even worse in November, officials said. It remains to be seen if the outbreak will have eased by then, or if it will be spiking anew. What is certain, though, is that the volume of mail ballots will be much higher because of higher turnout for the general election. And the presidential election in Pennsylvania will likely be decided by razor-thin margins, after Trump won by less than 1% of the votes cast in 2016.

How to fix the problem

There are two ways to lessen the waiting time, elections officials said: Start counting earlier and reduce the time it takes.

Reducing the processing time requires money to buy more machines and hire more staff to operate them. So starting earlier is the simpler fix.

But when the election law was changed last year, it required counties to wait until 8 p.m. before starting to count mail ballots.

Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who oversees elections, said at the time that she believed counties could manage the task. But pressure from the counties led state lawmakers to make a change in March: Counties can now begin counting mail ballots at 7 a.m. on election day, when polls open.

“I’ve only got 29 precincts, it’s not going to take me days and days,” said Florence Kellett, director of elections in Wyoming County.

Kellett and officials in several other counties said they would begin counting during election day. Still, they said lawmakers should update the law again, to allow them to start counting ballots days or even weeks earlier.

In recent weeks, Boockvar has taken up that call.

The 7 a.m. change helps, “but I don’t think it’s going to be sufficient for many counties,” she told reporters Wednesday during a conference call. “I think some of the races that are close, we will get results quickly. But if there are close races, it may take a couple of days.”

1783,1816,https://dcgazette.com/2020/the-game-of-truth/,2020-05-22,The Game of Truth ⋆ Dc Gazette,"When newly minted White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany took the stage last week for the first time—the first time a Trump press secretary has issued a formal conference in over six months—she encountered a ravenously bloodthirsty media gaggle. It was ready to pounce.

Would they be able to totally eviscerate her as they had a slew of her predecessors? Well, no. She turned the tables on them all. Predators, it seems, had become prey.

While the task of how to feed and water the Washington press corps is no secret to those in the press secretary business, what’s more impressive is when a White House press secretary can feed them the food of their own making. And so it happened. They served it up warm.

It came about 25 minutes into the press conference. Jeff Mason, Reuters’ White House correspondent, asked:

Kayleigh, in a previous life, before you were press secretary, you worked for the campaign. And you made a comment, I believe on Fox, in which you said President Trump will not allow the coronavirus to come to this country. Given what has happened since then, obviously, would you like to take that back?

Of course not. Would you like to take the media’s entire record back, McEnany replied.

Does Vox want to take back that they proclaim that the coronavirus would not be a deadly pandemic? Does The Washington Post want to take back that they told Americans to ‘get a grip, the flu is bigger than the coronavirus’? Does The Washington Post, likewise, want to take back that, ‘Our brains are causing us to exaggerate the threat of the coronavirus’? Does The New York Times want to take back that, ‘Fear of the virus may be spreading faster than the virus itself’? Does NPR want to take back that the flu was a much bigger threat than the coronavirus? And finally, once again, The Washington Post. Would they like to take back that the government should not respond aggressively to the virus?

From her perch atop the bully pulpit, McEnany did not wait around for replies. It was a “drop the mic” moment. But the point still stands.

The mainstream media have printed various misinformed or later-to-be-corrected statements about the impact of COVID-19, mainly because they (like most of America) were still learning about the spread of the virus and its potential public health implications.

The president was learning, too, in real time. The difference is that he is blamed by the media for every statement he makes. If it’s true, then it’s insensitive, and if it turns out to be inaccurate, then it was a blatant lie.

At this point, it seems that the mainstream media exists solely to refute and oppose anything the president says.

Of course, President Donald Trump is not perfect. He exaggerates. He makes blanket statements without caveat. And he is known to protect himself to the point of stretching reality.

Those who have come to know him and work with him on a daily basis understand his foibles. But they also understand that the president is merely human.

He breathes the same air and eats the same food we all do. He has hopes and dreams for his own life and for America that echo our own. Despite his many faults, he was duly elected to lead the country; he has our best interests at heart.

But the media’s raison d’etre exists, not in the truth, but solely in opposition. When the president goes left, whether right or wrong, the media go right. It is as if they have abdicated their roles as fact-finders and investigators and turned into repudiators.

This is laziness at its worst. It lacks credibility and betrays an emotional bias that goes to the heart of truth and falsehood. If the media is so readily able to embrace falsehoods merely to combat the president, are they not just as guilty of the betrayal of truth they accuse the president of committing?

Perhaps the most cynical media iconoclasm centers around the seeming glee some pundits take in the tanking economy. It is almost as if they embrace forced closings and their devastating economic effects as the welcome price of ridding the country of Trump.

Forget about the folks who are suffering. Forget about working mothers with children out of school and nowhere to go. All these pundits have to do is show up at their laptops and type away from the cushy surroundings of their high-end condos. But they aren’t forced to make the hard choices of laying off workers or letting crops rot in the field. For them, reopening the economy is synonymous with losing the political battle.

We all want a free press that is able to question the official line. As a media pundit and commentator, I often question the president’s approach. But it bears asking whether a press is truly “free” when it is bound by its preconceived notions of truth and falsehood.

Perhaps ideological constraints on fairness and objectivity devalue their roles as the investigators and revealers the Founders imagined when they enshrined the First Amendment.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""let the country down"" early in the nation's response to the Covid-19 crisis when it failed to scale diagnostic testing across the country, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said on Sunday.

""Early on in this crisis the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing,"" Navarro told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test, and that did set us back.""

When asked whether the White House still has confidence in the CDC to lead the country's response to the pandemic, Navarro said that ""you should ask the president that question, not me.""

In April, The Washington Post reported that the CDC's coronavirus testing kits were delayed due to ""a glaring scientific breakdown"" at the agency's central lab. The error was ""devastating to the country"" and ""really a terrible black mark on the CDC,"" James Le Duc, a former CDC officer, told The Post.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later confirmed with CNBC that the ""CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,"" according to a spokeswoman. The agency ""was not able to determine from information provided by the CDC whether the test issues were due to a design or manufacturing issue,"" the spokeswoman said.

Speaking with CBS on Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the CDC, which is an agency under HHS, has had to ""literally build this from the ground up"" and that it was the private sector's role to expand the CDC-developed test. He said the initial contaminated tests that the CDC developed prevented some of the scale up ""for a couple of weeks.""

In response to Navarro's comments, Azar said that he believes the CDC didn't let the country down and has always had the critical role of getting the private sector to the table.

""That was never going to be the backbone of testing, of broad, mass testing, in the United States,"" Azar told CBS, saying that was the role of companies like Abbott Laboratories, Roche and Thermo Fischer.

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a CNBC contributor who sits on the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina, told CBS on Sunday that even if the CDC had rolled out its early test perfectly, there still wouldn't have been enough diagnostic testing in the nation.

Azar told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. is now conducting more than 300,000 tests per day and approximately 10 million tests total. Although that's still a small portion of the country's population of approximately 328 million people.

""What needed to happen was someone needed to pick up the phone and call the CEOs of LabCorp and Quest and the other big labs probably sometime in January or at least in early February,"" Gottlieb said. He said that person would've been either Azar or FDA Commissioner Stephan Hahn.

""If they'd ask the CEOs to do that, I'm willing to bet they would've done it and you would've got the big labs in the game,"" Gottlieb said.",real

But the cruisers will come anyway.

Michigan motorheads are already hitting the streets this May as a cure for months of cabin fever.

Woodward Avenue — nicknamed “The COVID 500” by local residents — has been busy as spring weather brought out everything from classic sedans to modified hot rods to modern muscle cars. The Michigan Car Cruise Calendar Facebook page is teeming with posts as members share car gatherings and personal car updates.

In Rochester Hills last Wednesday a group of enthusiasts organized the “Afternoon Cruise” which attracted some 100 cars for a leisurely mid-day drive up and down Hamlin Street. Well, mostly leisurely. Some participants couldn’t resist the occasional tire-squealing burnout.

“We thought is was a cool idea, so quite a few of our staff members participated,” explained Kim Zeile, founder of Trans-Am racing engine maker Prefix Corp., who helped organize the event. “The area is slowly beginning to open back up, and this was a safe and fun way to get some cool vehicles out and interact with fellow car enthusiasts.”

Enthusiasts gathered over a typical smorgasbord of dream rides — Porsche 911s, Jeeps, jacked-up pickups, Ford Focus pocket rockets, ol’ '50s jalopies — in the Prefix parking lot before cruising. Prefix provided a food truck for attendees to grab a quick lunch, and Mother Nature cooperated with a beautiful afternoon.

“It meant a little taste of feeling back to normal,” said participant Jhan Dolphin. “After all, not much can compare to the freedom of rolling down the windows and going for a drive in your favorite ride.”

Woodward Avenue is Michigan’s cruising main street and recent weekends have been busy. Growling street rods have been doing patented loops around the traditional, 16-mile parade route that runs from Ferndale to Pontiac. Others have gathered in Woodward parking lots — hoods propped open to display sparkling engines underneath — as owners swap stories and urge on passing classics.

The activity starts a slow build to the official, 26th annual Dream Cruise on Saturday, Aug. 15 this year. The cruise reportedly attracts up to 1.5 million people.

Those numbers may be down this year as enthusiasts — especially older demographics — weigh the risks of COVID-19 and as authorities pressure organizers to social distance. Organizers have declined comment to date, citing the virus situation as too fluid to make plans three months out from the Cruise.

An announcement is expected in early June. Insiders say there will be changes, with participants urged to stay in their cars while communities cancel most official events.

Woodward Dream Cruise Parking, which helps cruisers find spots on the crowded route, posted on its Facebook page this week that the “Woodward Dream Cruise is going to happen this year ... however, you will see big changes. Most of the organized community events will be canceled, including entertainment, concerts, car shows, vendors, Emergency Vehicle show, kid zone, etc., to keep large crowd gatherings to a minimum.”

The Dream Cruise has always been controversial among some local residents who object to the noise and odors that the rolling traffic jam brings each summer. With added concerns over COVID-19, nerves are more on edge this year.

Paul Canvasser, a resident of Poppleton Park in Birmingham, recently wrote on Next Door that “I am fed up with the noise and racing that has overtaken Woodward. It is even more annoying since I have been isolated at home for several weeks. Everything else is shut down, but the cruising is the first thing to come back. It is time to alter this situation!”

The post received 310 community responses.

More gatherings are scheduled this weekend from Rochester to Woodward as the weather warms to 70 degrees. But critics may get their wish for a respite from the COVID 500 on Sunday. The chance of rain is 100 percent.

The old maxim certainly rings true when we consider the life-enhancing things which have disappeared since the Coronavirus lockdown, and whose return would do much to lift our morale.

The Grand National. The FA Cup. The weekend football programme. The climax to the Rugby Six Nations. Wimbledon. The World Snooker Championship. Euro 2020. The Olympic Games. Just some of the great sporting events we’ve missed - or will miss - since Covid-19 left its calling card - and the subsequent lockdowns took effect.

The reaction of most public figures was to say ‘Who cares. Sport doesn’t really matter’. Even those who profess to be sports fans have said we can easily do without it. Piers Morgan, the shy and retiring breakfast television presenter (and Arsenal supporter), has repeatedly opposed plans to complete the 2019/20 football season.

Not only has there been little public support from media ‘Talking Heads’ for sport to return, sporting events have even been blamed for the spread of Covid19. I wrote in a recent Sputnik column on how the Cheltenham National Hunt Racing Festival, which took place from 10-13th March, has been made the Covid-19 fall-guy by many people, even though there was no compelling evidence to back up the claims that holding it was injurious to public health.

There were hopes earlier this month that racing might return behind ‘closed doors’ on 15th May, but the government’s new ‘road map’ for easing the lockdown, published on Monday, put paid to that. Now the earliest we can hope for a return in the UK is early June, and even that must be in some doubt, when one reads the small print.

Two important points are missed by those who say the return of sport should be a very low priority in the current circumstances. Firstly, we’re talking about industries which directly or indirectly many thousands of people and contribute greatly to the economy. Horse-racing for instance brings in between £3.5bn and £4bn. But a lot of jobs in racing will go unless the sport gets back into action soon, with smaller trainers, and the smaller racecourses, facing a very uncertain future.

Secondly, there‘s the enormous positive impact that watching - and playing - sport can have in our daily lives.

Consider this: in a parallel universe this coming Sunday is the final day of the Premiership football season. Think of the excitement we would be enjoying - and all the thrills we‘ve missed these last seven weeks or so.

Without the drama of horse-racing and ´Final Score’, Saturday afternoons in the UK are simply not the same. Last week, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the return of sport would ‘lift the spirits of the nation’. For once, he was right - but guess what? He was shouted down.

""You’re an absolute T**T. We don’t need sport to lift the nation"", was one tweeter’s reaction. How well that tweeter would have fitted in in the days of Oliver Cromwell. During the kill-joy rule of the Puritans in the 1650s most sports were banned.

""Despite playing in his youth, the game's (football’s) 'frivolity' didn't fit into Oliver Cromwell's puritanical world"", reports the Guardian.

I’m sure ‘The Lord Protector’ would feel very much at home in the lockdown Britain of today - with its lack of sport, its closed theatres and pubs, and its shut-down places of public entertainment.

A country where even citizens in Warrington doing a socially-distanced conga for VE Day received fierce criticism from the 2020 equivalent of the New Model Army. It seems that having any kind of fun ( apart from clapping outside your front door once a week every Thursday evening), is not allowed in 'Lockdown Britain'.

© AFP 2020 / ISABEL INFANTES An image of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II making her her address to the UK and the Commonwealth in relation to the coronavirus epidemic is displayed on the advertising boards at Piccadilly Circus in central London on April 9, 2020, as Britain continues to battle the outbreak of Coronavirus Covid-19 and warm weather tests the nationwide lockdown as the long Easter weekend approaches. - The disease has struck at the heart of the British government, infected more than 60,000 people nationwide and killed over 7,000, with a daily death toll in England of 765 reported on April 9.

Of course we all need to ‘stay alert’ over Covid19- and take sensible precautions to avoid catching it or passing it on, but surely the existence of a virus doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have any enjoyment at all in our lives? What in fact is ‘saving life’ for, if we don’t enjoy it?

The return of sport would be a wonderful diversion from the depressing diet of ‘fear-porn’ news we are fed on a daily basis. How lovely it would be to once again become engrossed in issues of promotion and relegation. On focusing on who was going to win the 3.35 at Sandown Park, rather than what was going to be said at the daily Covid-19 Press briefings.

Those who dismiss sport as a ‘triviality’ fail to understand that something can be simultaneously both unimportant and important. To some the result of a horse race is of supreme unimportance. But to those who train or look after horses, who ride them, who bet on them, or who follow the form, it’s far more important than many other things. Ditto soccer. Keith Castle was Britain’s first successful heart transplant patient, back in 1979. His first words after regaining consciousness after his operation? ‘How did Fulham get on?’ He was a man who clearly had his priorities right, (if not his choice of football team).

I’d say the return of Saturday football, regular horse-racing, and other sports too, will do more to cheer the country up than any of the po-faced talking heads who oppose such moves. And goodness me, don’t we all need some cheering up at present.

“We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the donation with his wife Cherry Chen.

The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.

On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”

Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders bought the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.

About 750,000 of the masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. More than 500 officers have tested positive for COVID-19, and three have died.

About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.

The distribution of the masks began May 4.

Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, said the donation comes at a time China is under fire by Trump and others and said, “We all have a common enemy in COVID-19 and a shared interest in stopping its spread, protecting our brave frontline responders and ultimately finding a vaccine.”

Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic. In early February, he and his companies contributed $7.5 million to help China’s Hubei province, where the pandemic began.",real
1868,1339,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/05/there-will-be-no-recovery-without-production/,2020-05-18,There Will Be No Recovery Without Production,"Through most of the coronavirus crisis, those who have made the case for stay-at-home, reduce or stop work, and narrow the range of retail shopping to assure “social distancing” to reduce the spread of the virus have accused their critics of being more interested in preserving livelihoods than “saving lives.” But there is no preservation of any lives if people are not able to produce and work, without which none of the necessities and other wants of any members of society can be fulfilled.

Listening to many politicians and political pundits, and even some “economists,” you could easily think that 250 years of economic understanding had never happened. One of the oldest of economic fallacies is that money is wealth; that is, the notion that if you create pieces of paper, put some kind of government stamp on it announcing that it is “money,” and spread it around among the members of society, you thereby conjure up from nothing actual material and other forms of wealth.

Money is a medium of exchange, some commodity or other useful thing that is found widely advantageous to use as a convenient intermediary to better facilitate the exchange of other goods and services one for the other when more direct barter transactions are found to be impossible to arrange or more costly to carry out.

Printing Money Does Not Magically Create Goods

But increasing the number of units of the particular item used as money does not, in itself, increase the physical quantities of all the other goods that people want to acquire through exchange to satisfy their wants and desires. These other goods that people actually want must be produced, manufactured, transported and made ready in the forms and at the places desired by members of society. They do not fall from the sky and do not miraculously appear by waving pieces of paper money (or their electronic and computer equivalents) above your head after offering some incantation to the “manna from heaven” god.

This was all understood and even popularized for the general public by political economists in the early 19th century, when “economics” was the trendy and “in” subject about which any publicly minded and intelligent member of British and American society wanted to be knowledgeable and informed. Yes, there was a time, in spite of Thomas Carlyle’s famous quip, when economics was not considered to be the “dismal science.” It was the subject essential to any thinking and thoughtful person to understand the social world in which he lived, and the political and institutional circumstances most conducive to the betterment of the human condition, especially the improvement of the poor.

For instance, Harriet Martineau (1802-1876), a leading British classical liberal-oriented feminist, abolitionist, social critic, novelist, and historian, successfully popularized the fundamental ideas of economics in a 9-volume series offering, Illustrations of Political Economy (1834), in the form of narrative stories of ordinary people through whom the principles of economic theory and practice were made real and relevant to millions of readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the first volume, for instance, a group of settlers in a faraway land are pillaged and plundered by a marauding band, leaving them with nothing to start over with other than their physical strength, the knowledge inside their heads, and whatever raw materials and wild animals were in their immediate vicinity. From this, she shows that the “ultimate resource” is the human being himself with the creative potentials inside people’s minds, combined with resolute determination to work, save, invest, and produce to create through time the prosperity and well-being that we call civilization.

A Sack of Gold is Not the Same as a Stock of Desired Goods

Shortly after the initial disaster has struck and the little band has tried to get through their first day with nothing left to help themselves with other than their own heads and their own hands, two of the group reflect on their misfortune and circumstances, including that just having money is not to have wealth. One of them says,

“I wish that the people of England, who think that wealth consists in gold, and silver, and bank notes, would come here and see how much their money is worth in our settlement. A thousand sovereigns would not here buy a hat, nor a roll of bank notes a loaf of bread. Here, at least, money is not wealth.”

His companion replies:

“Nor anywhere else, as we may see by putting a very simple case. Put a man with a bag of gold into an empty house, in England, or anywhere else, and he will starve in a week, unless he is allowed to give his gold in exchange for what will supply his wants. But give a man, who has not a shilling, a room well stocked with meat, and bread, and beer, and he has wealth enough to maintain him for a week, or a fortnight, as long as his provision lasts. And this is a test which holds good all the world over . . .

Wealth is made up of many things – of land, of clothes, furniture, food and of the means (whether gold and silver or anything else) by which these things may be obtained . . . Poor as we are, we are richer than if we were in the midst of the sandy desert to the north of us, with a wagon full of gold in our possession. We have what gold and silver could not buy in such a place, food and shelter.”

They go on to ruminate on the fact that though their situation is better than in a desert because there are edible plants, raw materials useable in various productions, and wild animals that may be eaten or harnessed to assist them in their work, none of these are, as yet, directly useful things until they have applied their knowledge and human labor to transform them into either the productive tools (capital) with which their work may be made possible or easier and more productive, or into the consumable and useable finished consumer items to satisfy their actual wants.

The first reminds his friend that, “Even the manna in the wilderness would have been of no more use to the Hebrews than the carp in the pool to us, if they had not exerted themselves to gather it up. Food was never yet rained into the mouth of any man.” To which his companion adds, “And if it had been, he must have troubled to hold back his head and open his mouth. So, you see what conclusion we come to, even in an extreme case.”

Forgetting that Production Comes Before Consumption

Maybe because two hundred years ago so many more in the world were still so close to abject poverty – it is estimated that in 1820 the world population numbered barely one billion of which nearly 90 percent lived in serious or severe material want – that most people understood two centuries ago when reminded about the reality of their daily life, that production comes before plenty, that work is necessary if you are to have wealth. This is less the case today when out of over 7.7 billion people only about 10 percent are subject to the lowest of material circumstances, Far too many in 2020 think that the things of everyday life just “somehow” appear and are waiting and ready to be bought if you have but money in your pocket.

So, give people money and they can pay their rent or mortgage, buy food at the supermarket, and purchase medicines or shoes, because, well, all those things are just “there” every day when and as you want them. Oh, yes, there can be panic buying, as was commonly seen in February and March of this year when people went crazy purchasing huge quantities of toilet paper, hand sanitizers, protective masks, and a variety of storable food items.

But these concerns all had to do with presumed failures on the part of politicians and private enterprises to know way ahead of time that they should have made sure there were more of all these and other things readily available in any maximum quantity that consumers wanted right then and there. It was just supposed to be there. Clearly another “failure” of capitalism or inept government planning because the “wrong people” were in charge.

What the government lockdown policy response to the coronavirus has highlighted is the fundamental and inescapable truth of what the 19th French economist, Jean-Baptiste Say (1767-1832), called “the law of markets.” Contrary to the reawakened Keynesian mindset that all of our economic troubles are “aggregate demand failures” arising from a lack of spending due to people not having enough money in their pockets, the dramatic collapse in production, the massive rise in unemployment, and the falling off in people’s spending on final goods and services are all due to governments shutting down the “supply-side” of the economy.

Our Ability to “Demand” Arises from Our Capacities to “Supply”

As Jean-Baptiste Say, and those who followed his reasoning, argued, there is always work to be done, since there are always human wants that are as yet not fully satisfied; and as soon as one such human want has been significantly fulfilled to one degree or another, the human mind looks ahead and imagines other things that seem attractive and desirable to have. As a result, work merely of different sorts is there to be taken up in even greater amounts.

People may satisfy their wants and desires in one of two ways, Say explained. They may directly work and produce the goods they want for their own purposes. Few of our desires, however, can be fulfilled through our own personal efforts. So, the other way is to work and produce something that others might consider worth buying from us in exchange for what they can offer in trade; that is, goods that we want that either we do not have the ability to make for ourselves or only at higher costs than at which that potential trading partner can sell them to us.

Of course, in modern society rare are the occasions in which we directly trade what we have for sale in exchange for what we actually want from another person. Usually, we first sell what we offer to someone interested in our wares for an agreed upon price in the form of a sum of money, and having earned that money from partly fulfilling someone else’s wants, we use the money that we have so earned to then offer it to some other person in the market for that which we actually want that they are able to supply.

I trade my labor services to the institution of higher learning that hires me to teach economics, and I then turn around and spend the money I’ve earned on the goods and services I’m interested in buying from people who may have no interest in economics, and certainly not in accepting some economics lectures from me in direct trade for what they have that I want.

Money Earned Comes before Money to Spend

My ability to demand what others may have for sale is dependent upon my success in producing and supplying something that some of those others might be willing to purchase from me, and from which I earn the money income as a producer that enables me to demand the outputs of others as a consumer. In logical, sequential time, my ability to produce, supply and sell precedes my capacity to demand, buy, and consume.

“Today,” I may be both demanding and supplying. But my ability to demand (money earned in my pocket available to spend) has come from having sold something in the past and earned that money from prior sales (even if the past is merely a month or week, a day or a few hours earlier).

Of course, I may demand more goods in the present, in money terms, than I have earned from recently supplying in the past. But I can do so only if I draw upon my own savings from having spent less than I have earned in the past or by using the borrowed savings of others with the promises to pay it back with interest out of my current or future earnings.

In all of these cases of demanding out of what I have recently earned, or previously saved, or borrowed from someone else’s savings, what that sum of money will buy, in general, in the marketplace – a dollar’s purchasing power over goods available for sale – will depend on two things: how much of desired goods have been produced in the past and are available for purchase in the present, and the concurrent money demands of others also wishing to buy the same desired goods.

Speaking of the economy as a whole, if supplies in general decrease or total money demands increase, the prices of goods in general will tend to rise. Not all prices would rise at the same time nor proportionally with each other but based upon the relative greater scarcities of each of the fewer goods on the market as a whole, and the particular degrees of relative demands for specific goods out of the greater quantity of money in people’s pockets in general.

Shutdowns the Cause of Falling Output and Rising Unemployment

What we are witnessing at the present time has been a dramatic falling off in people’s ability to demand desired goods partly due to government decrees, especially imposed at the state levels in the U.S., that have prevented interested and willing buyers from demanding all that they would like to purchase, particularly in the retail and service sectors of the American economy. This has led to a huge rise in unemployment in these sectors of the economy. At the same time, the imposed halting of production except for what state governments have declared to be “essential” manufacturing and supplying has resulted in massive layoffs in, yet, other sectors of the economy.

In the Employment Situation report for April 2020, issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (May 8, 2020), the government’s official measured unemployment rate, for the economy as a whole, rose from 3.5 percent in February of this year to 14.7 percent in April.

However, there is another measurement used by the BLS known as “U-6,” which includes not only those currently unemployed and looking for work during the last four weeks, but also those considered as only “marginally” in the labor force, as those working part time but who want to work full time, and “discouraged workers” who want to work but have stopped looking for a job. Using this more inclusive measure, the BLS reports that unemployment rose from 7 percent in February to 22.8 percent in April.

It is difficult to demand the outputs of others, when (depending on the measure) between almost 15 percent and 23 percent of the labor force finds itself not fully employed in the U.S. economy. This is especially the case in what the BLS categorizes as the “hospitality and leisure” sectors of the market, in which the Bureau reports unemployment in April was 39.3 percent.

The government’s lockdowns have, on the one hand, induced declines in production and output, at least in the short run, resulting in reduced supplies of various (though not all) goods. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in its estimate of the 2020 first quarter Gross Domestic Production calculates that GDP may have declined by at least 4.8 percent at an annualized rate.

The restrictions on retail shopping combined with the massive fall in employment has reduced the money demands for many goods and services, and the resources that are used in manufacturing. In the jargon of mainstream macroeconomics, the velocity of the circulation of money declined during the first three months of 2020 by nearly 15 percent (M-2) and by 9.6 percent (MZM), compared to the velocity of money in the fourth quarter of 2019.

If the lockdowns proceed to be loosened as they are in the various states, and if these trillions of dollars being created by the Treasury through massive deficit spending and through expansive “lines of credit” by the Federal Reserve to support financially ailing businesses proceed as announced, it is difficult not to expect significant price inflation looking to the end of 2020 and into 2021.

The Need for Coordinated Productions Through Time

Part of the illusion of just needing money to immediately assure and bring forth the goods wanted and desired arises from the failure to fully understand that all production takes time and any disruption of the processes and stages of production threatens the entire structure of investment and manufacturing.

The real time-structure of production has been implied in discussions concerning potential breakdowns in the interdependent global supply-chains connecting resources, manufacturing, transportation, and retail marketing to the ultimate consumer. All the stages of production through which goods sequentially pass, in their own required respective ways, rely upon intricate complementary coordination if those goods are to be continually forthcoming in the desired patterns and quantities, and when they may be wanted.

The nature and logic of these relationships may be captured in the following table:

In the table, above, the number of production steps to bring a particular good to market requires 5 interdependent stages of production, each of which takes one month to complete. Thus, if this good was wanted for consumer use in May of 2020, the production on it needed to begin at the start of the year, in January.

If the same good is wanted in the same quantity and quality in June of 2020, as well, its production process had to begin in February at the same time that the quantity of the good wanted in May was going through stage 2 of its production process. In March of 2020, the good wanted in May had to be going through stage 3 of its production process, while the good wanted in June had to be passing through its stage 2, and if this good is also wanted in its finished form in July had to be starting its stage 1 of production in March.

Any stoppage or disruption in manufacturing processes and employments in any one or more of these production stages threatens, in principle, the ability for production to continue smoothly through time so the final good is available in particular amounts to the consumers wishing to demand it, period-after-period.

This highlights another aspect of Say’s Law of Markets. If there are not to be “gluts” of some goods and shortages of others, each of these interdependent markets must be coordinated through the competitive interactions of supply and demand, in which prices serve as the guiding signals and incentives to direct people in the use of their resources, capital, and labor in the needed synchronized patterns both at a moment in time and through time as goods in process pass through their required stages of production.

The Fallacy of “Essential” and “Non-Essential” Productions

Government’s insistence on distinguishing between “essential” and “nonessential” productions and consumer goods are shown for the shallow misreading it is. Markets are interconnected and interrelated in such an inescapable way that what the government tags as “non-essential” may be crucial for the maintenance and operation of other production processes that are labelled as “essential” by those in political authority.

Market relationships are too complex and overlapping for any but those in the production processes themselves at each of the respective stages of production to fully and effectively know and understand what needs to be done in changing market conditions to substitute particular resources and types of capital and labor from some parts of the structures of production to others as communicated and discovered through the relative patterns of prices and wages that convey the needed knowledge to make informed decisions so to keep productions moving forward with minimal breaks and disruptions in and across markets.

This is also why all the talk about loosening the lockdowns in “steps” over time misses the central point that all markets and the actions of the people in them are interconnected in ways that releasing some while delaying opening others threatens a successful restoring of productions and employments as soon as possible to rapidly escape from the government-created economic chaos in the shortest possible period of time without introducing other imbalances and shortages that need not happen, if not for continuing government involvement.

What is needed, and now, is the freeing of all markets from the heavy-handed restrictive commands and controls of those in political authority, if we are to restore the economy and the employments it previously and presently could offer to all those looking for work at market-determined wages and prices. Any attempt by those in political power to guide and direct this process, regardless of the reason and rationale, only gets in the way of all the members of the society reestablishing their mutually serving productions as the means for acquiring the supply-side opportunities and capacities to demand the outputs of others.

Saving Livelihoods Is “Saving Lives”

In this discussion I might be accused of avoiding why governments have intervened so pervasively and intensely into social and economic activities: to slow down and maybe remove the danger from the coronavirus through society-wide restrictions and restraints on people’s freedom to move, work and earn. That is, “saving lives” by doing all that is possible to prevent or radically slow down the spread of the virus.

But “saving lives” is inseparable from saving livelihoods. The “supply-side” earning of livings is the only means of assuring that all the goods and services needed and wanted to meet all of our requirements are there when we want them. It enables us to earn the means for demanding what others are producing and offering on the market by having supplied some of what those others desire in reciprocal trade.

Maybe I lead an especially sheltered life, but it never entered my mind that beer producers might modify their manufacturing in such a way as to be making hand sanitizing liquids, instead, to meet a suddenly much higher demand for the latter product to fight getting or spreading the coronavirus. I had not expected to drop off some shirts at the dry cleaners and discover that the owners were now producing and offering multi-layered cloth face masks on the premises to partly compensate for a large falling off of their regular business.

An essential purpose of allowing markets to be free and open in all circumstances is precisely to take advantage of what people can imagine, create, and produce to meet changing patterns of demand in their respective corners of society in ways that others might not and, indeed, cannot anticipate. The sudden anxieties in February and March about there not being enough ventilators to meet hospital needs for potential cases of respiratory failures due to the virus, saw numerous improvisations of workable substitute ventilator devices of different types, if the need had fully arisen.

As Friedrich A. Hayek brought out in The Constitution of Liberty (1960), personal and economic liberty is crucial precisely because we cannot fully know or anticipate what creative minds might imagine, the results of which we will be glad to have and benefit from, but which might never emerge if people are not free to discover and try:

“Liberty is essential in order to leave room for the unforeseeable and the unpredictable; we want it because we have learned to expect from it the opportunity of realizing many of our aims. It is because every individual knows so little and, in particular, because we rarely know which of us knows best that we trust the independent and competitive efforts of many to induce the emergence of what we shall want when we see it.”

That is why we need markets to be open and free, now, for people be make their own best decisions about the trade-offs and risks to protect themselves and their loved ones from the dangers from catching the coronavirus, and in that process to free the supply-sides of the market from government shutdowns so people may earn the means of demanding what others produce for a return to the standards of living that are possible even in the face of the current health concerns.

Results were based from about 5,600 completed records from employees of 26 clubs. Samples were obtained on April 14 and 15.

“It allows us to get a peek of the nation-wide prevalence,” said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford, one the study’s leaders, said Sunday.

The start of the baseball season has been delayed because of the virus outbreak. There’s no timetable for when the season might begin.

Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives. Bhattacharya said the survey had a 0.5% false positive rate.

Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus.

MLB employees have been less affected than their surrounding communities have been, Bhattacharya said.

The University of Southern California and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City also led the study.

Data for players was not broken out. The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.

MLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.

The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.

“The MLB population is a special population. They’re not representative of every city that they’re in,” Bhattacharya said. “They also are more well to do than a typical population, so it’s not representative. ... They have an organization that allows us to sample in just two days time in so many places all at once. And that’s unique.”

“I don’t get the sense that they are doing it to benefit them,” Bhattacharya said. “If the economy opens up, sports are huge gatherings. So in a sense it benefits everybody. I actually think they’re doing it because they want to contribute to public health knowledge.”

Each club was given approximately 350 tests.

“To be able to have a window into how widespread the epidemic is in so many places all at once is a really special thing,” Bhattacharya said.

Updated at 10:06 p.m. ET

The IRS has paid out more than $207 billion in coronavirus relief payments to individual taxpayers, as part of the $2 trillion package passed by Congress known as the CARES Act.

And among the recipients of those $1,200 payments are the bank accounts of dead individuals — a problem that could impact millions of American families.

Bob L'Hommedieu's father passed away in December after a long battle with dementia. So L'Hommedieu notified the Veterans Administration and the Social Security Administration that his father had passed, and payments from those agencies were halted. But on April 15, he noticed a payment in the amount of $1,200 in his late father's account.

It was a coronavirus relief payment from the IRS.

""I feel bad that this money is sitting in my dad's account,"" says L'Hommedieu, who lives in Houston. ""I don't know what to do with it. And there are people out there that need it badly.""

""And, you know, that bothers me. Quite a bit. I wish I knew what to do with it, but, you know, I don't,"" he added.

L'Hommedieu reached out to his two senators in Texas. One sent a form letter that didn't answer his questions. The other told him to contact the IRS. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal one week ago that heirs should return the money sent to deceased individuals. But people who talked to NPR said they had more questions than answers.

""There's mass confusion,"" said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""There's been no official guidance as to how, in this instance, people should return the money that was received for their loved ones.""

The IRS did not answer questions about the payments, but the scope of the problem has the potential to be vast. The CDC estimates that 2.8 million Americans died in 2018, for example. And there are signs that people who died more than two years ago have received payments.

Karen McClure, of Fort Collins, Colo., says her mother passed away in January 2018. But in April of this year, her late mother's bank account received a payment of $1,200.

McClure said she reached out to her local congressman but hasn't heard back.

""The government is being very reactive instead of proactive to this situation — which I find frustrating,"" she says.

Mark Everson, who served as IRS commissioner from 2003 to 2007, says that the IRS has generally been doing a good job, ""but there's a real trade-off of speed versus accuracy in the processing,"" he says. ""There's a lot of pressure to move quickly, and in the past Treasury and the IRS have been criticized because they haven't moved quickly enough.""

Everson says that people in this situation should rely on official guidance from IRS.gov.

Teresa Wilmot, 71, has been trying to do just that. The Rockford, Ill., resident lost her partner of 39 years, Frank Dajka, just two months ago. Last month, she noticed a payment in his account.

""I'm coping with [the] Frank stuff pretty well at this point. I'm not over it. I probably will never be over it,"" she says. ""But that part didn't bother me. I'm probably angrier at the government for sending out a payment to somebody who's deceased.""

Wilmot has been trying without success to find guidance online from the IRS to send the money back.

""I went online to the address on the letter and looked for a long time trying to find some way that I could first send the payment back. And I couldn't find that,"" she says. ""So I look for a way to contact somebody at the IRS or the Treasury or whatever to return the payment. And I couldn't find that.""

After multiple requests, the IRS declined to answer questions and directed them to the Treasury Department.

Wednesday morning, after this story first published, the Treasury Department told NPR that payments made to people who died before the payment was received should be returned to the IRS, and it published instructions on its website.

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint charging the Trump administration with failing to heed his calls for preparation and then ending his role as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. He speaks to Norah O'Donnell in his first interview since his removal from BARDA for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast this Sunday.

In an excerpt from the interview that appeared on the CBS Evening News, O'Donnell notes that Bright says in his complaint that HHS Secretary Alex Azar was intent on downplaying the catastrophic threat.

""Why would he do that?"" O'Donnell asked Bright.

""You know, I don't know why he would do that,"" Bright said.

President Trump was also downplaying the threat. He said at an event in Michigan on January 30, ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment.""

""Remember, the entire leadership was focused on containment,"" Bright told O'Donnell. ""There was a belief that we could contain this virus and keep it out of the United States. Containment doesn't work. Containment does buy time. It could slow. It very well could slow the spread. But while you're slowing the spread, you better be doing something in parallel to be prepared for when that virus breaks out. That was my job.""

The Department of Health and Human Services has said that it strongly disagrees with the claims in Bright's complaint and Secretary Azar said, ""his allegations do not hold water.""

Kane, the Islanders’ Mathew Barzal and the Jets’ Mark Scheifele spent 45 minutes on a video conference call Monday laughing and poking fun at each other through entertaining pick-’em and trivia games.

Whom would Kane want with him in a three-on-three game, excluding Hawks teammates? The Maple Leafs’ Auston Matthews and the Kings’ Drew Doughty.

Whom would he not want to face on a breakaway? The Canadiens’ Carey Price or the Lightning’s Andrei Vasilevskiy.

Whom would he want with him on a two-on-one? The Rangers’ Artemi Panarin.

‘‘That was probably the funnest hockey I’ve ever played,’’ Kane added to his Panarin answer, providing a quote that instantly went viral on Twitter.

Sure, Kane might be stuck inside his Chicago condominium. And, sure, he has been watching NBC Sports Chicago’s replays of the Hawks’ 2010 Stanley Cup run and playing Xbox video games for the first time in years. But those time-fillers don’t compare to the excitement of live hockey. (The Pilates studio in his building — his temporary training center — isn’t exactly the same as Fifth Third Arena, either.)

Just like the rest of society, however, he’s finding a way to make the most of the downtime. As a result, the conference call was as entertaining as a period of preseason hockey.

It turns out the same can be said for much of the rest of the NHL. In fact, the league-run calls that have sprung up by the dozens in recent weeks — Hawks captain Jonathan Toews’ appearance March 31 turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg — have provided more insight into players’ daily lives, hobbies and personalities than a normal season does.

The calls rarely have been newsworthy — Doughty did drop a relative bombshell on another call Monday, when he said he doesn’t see how the season is going to return — but they have been lively, playful and thoroughly engrossing, representing a huge difference from typical locker-room interviews.

The best part of Toews’ call came when he and the Blues’ Alex Pietrangelo meandered into discussing old-school montages of NHL hits on YouTube. Kane’s call had even more laugh-out-loud moments, such as when Barzal forgot which college Islanders general manager Lou Lamoriello led to the 1983 Frozen Four.

‘‘Those contract negotiations just got a little bit tougher,’’ Kane quipped.

Once the coronavirus pandemic ends and hockey returns, the calls inevitably will fade from the NHL’s media procedures. But the league, which long has fostered an atmosphere that discourages players from speaking out about personal thoughts and passions, would be wise to learn from the calls’ popularity.

The NBA’s culture of individualism has translated perfectly to the 21st-century sports world, especially its social-media component. The NHL’s culture of always-team-first homogeneity hasn’t, for better or worse.

But it’s clear the stars of the NHL can juggle showing their human side and representing their team. Kane didn’t compromise any of his talent, mystique or respect by joking around on the call, but he did make himself seem like more of a real person.

If one silver lining of the shutdown proves to be a greater emphasis on candid, lighthearted discussion among the NHL’s biggest names in future seasons, the league might emerge from the pandemic in a better place than it entered it.",real

At the mention of wrestling, Oliver was unable to resist the chance to invite Adam Driver to “chokeslam me to hell, you nasty shed.” He also took a pause to reflect on his ongoing obsession with Driver, wondering whether he’s bothered by Oliver’s continued sexualization of him through over-the-top, masochistic come-ons each week and musing that the actor might even have grounds to sue. “To which I say: Do it. Slap a restraining order on me, you forlorn block. Beg me to stop, you menacing obstacle.”",real

A CDC panel usually decides","No matter how well-prepared we are, there won’t immediately be enough coronavirus vaccine to immunize all Americans. Choices will have to be made about who goes to the front of the line.

“It’s inevitable that the vaccine will come out more slowly than we like. We’re not going to have 350 million doses delivered day one,” said Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

To be most protective, a list of the first to be immunized must be carefully crafted based on what type of vaccine may become available, who it works best for and whether the disease is still raging.

Since 1964, the United States has relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make those decisions. As soon as the Food and Drug Administration licenses a new vaccine, ACIP offers guidelines on how it should be distributed, to whom and when.

The World Health Organization has a similar group, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

More:'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.

ACIP already has begun working on a plan for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The WHO group began its process last week.

“We’re starting as early as we can to deal with the torrent of data that’s coming out,"" said Dr. Grace Lee, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine and a current ACIP member. ""We don’t want to wait until the vaccine becomes available and begin our deliberations then.”

Typically, ACIP’s guidelines would be used without question. That became slightly less clear Friday with the announcement of a White House initiative called Operation Warp Speed.

In a news conference in the Rose Garden, President Donald Trump said the initiative would create a group of experts and bring together the CDC, National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the U.S. military to work at “record speed” to find, test, manufacture and distribute a vaccine.

Moncef Slaoui, a former pharmaceutical executive who Trump named to head Operation Warp Speed, said early clinical trial data from at least one vaccine candidate made him confident “we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. We will do the best we can to do that.”

Trump announces 'Operation Warp Speed,' says U.S. could have coronavirus vaccine by January

Vaccine experts have consistently urged caution in presuming a vaccine will be available soon. The White House Coronavirus Task Force's Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that while a vaccine is likely within the next year or two, the process takes time. Securing a vaccine quickly would require everything falling exactly into place, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has said.

""You can rush vaccine development but only when you understand – there’s no way around it – you are trading safety for speed,"" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.

Few details of how coordination within Operation Warp Speed would work were provided, and it is unclear what role it will play in vaccine allocation. An unnamed government official involved with the initiative told CNN earlier this month one of the tasks of the group is to determine who gets the first doses.

The CDC referred inquiries about how the two groups would work together to the White House. The White House did not respond to a request for clarification.

Vaccine experts have spent years considering the best and most effective way to dole out immunizations. ACIP has clear and transparent guidelines on how to conduct the process available on its website, and all its meetings in which it votes on vaccine recommendations are public and webcast. The next is on June 24.

Discussions center on balancing protection for the largest number of people with protecting the most vulnerable.

“If I’ve only got 30 million doses for the next year and I’ve got a population of 350 million, who do I assign propriety to?” said Dr. Arthur Reingold, division head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at Berkeley and an internationally recognized expert on infectious disease.

Health care providers, first responders, the military, political leaders, older adults, pregnant women and children are generally put at the front of the line, depending on the disease and the vaccine, said Reingold, who served on ACIP for many years.

“All kinds of ethicists are brought to the table,” he said.

Another approach to control an epidemic is to focus on hot spots where a disease is spreading and there are high transmission rates.

""You would rush vaccine to the area, open your clinics and try to get a large proportion of the population vaccinated quickly,"" Pavia said.

For SARS-CoV-2, the devil is in the details because so much remains unknown about who it affects and how.

Vaccines differ. One may be best for healthy adults, another better for children, and a third most effective for older adults or those with preexisting medical conditions.

In the case of the new coronavirus, data might show although older people are severely affected by COVID-19, immunizing their caregivers could better protect them, depending on how effective the vaccine is for different ages.

“We think about who’s at risk for being exposed, who suffers the worst complications and which population provides the highest benefit due to herd immunity,” said Lee.

Herd immunity is when enough people in the population have been infected and developed immunity to the virus that it can no longer spread freely. Scientists' models estimate 65% of the population needs to be immune to establish such immunity and stop the spread of the disease.

So far, infection rates alone are nowhere near high enough to create herd immunity. While a national infection rate in the United States has not yet been determined, in France, an estimated 4.4% of the population is believed to have been infected with the disease as of May 11, according to a paper in the journal Science.

Whoever determines who gets inoculated first, public health experts say past experience shows the best medical conclusion isn’t always the best solution.

During a shortage of flu vaccine in 2004, it was decided that elderly people, who were at high risk, should get vaccinated first. It turned out they didn’t want it.

“They said, ‘I’d rather my grandchildren receive the vaccine,’ ” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.

After health care workers and first responders are immunized, Schaffner suggested simply making a vaccine available on a first-come, first-served basis.

“Vaccine left in the refrigerator never protected anyone from anything,” he said.

Some health care professionals say Americans need to be part of the conversation about how any coming coronavirus vaccine should be doled out.

“We need to engage with the public now. You’ve got to consider public values,” said Daniel Salmon, a professor of international health who directs the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “It’s not all about what the scientists think.”",real

President of the UFC he may be, but White isn’t averse to being the butt of a joke now and then.

He proved that on Saturday when he tweeted a hilarious video at ‘The Notorious’ McGregor, which featured the fiery Dubliner initially as a crocodile menacing the waters before he emerges as a bull raging through the streets, running after spectators and tossing them over walls with big punches - before finally landing a huge right-hook on 50-year-old Dana himself.

The video, which has actually been doing the rounds online for some time, is backed by some riotous UFC commentary of some of McGregor’s most famous and controversial moments.

It also features a slightly tubby schoolkid sobbing in terror as the Notorious pops up at his car window and screams at him with his famous pre-fight war cry.

All told, it’s been an interesting weekend so far for McGregor, who earlier in the day tweeted out his rankings for the greatest MMA fighter of all time - but didn’t put himself as number one - well, not yet anyway.

General director, president and CEO Anthony Freud made the announcement on Thursday morning, noting that all public performances and events slated through June 30 have been moved to upcoming seasons.

The U.S. debut of Paris’ Théâtre du Châtelet production of “42nd Street” (originally set for May 29-June 21) has been moved to the spring of the 2021-2022 season. Stephen Mear will return to direct.

The midwest premiere of Jeanine Tesori and Tazewell Thompson’s “Blue” (originally set for June 16-28) at The Yard at Chicago Shakespeare Theater will move to January 2021. Enrique Mazzola, Lyric’s music director designate will conduct. Also, the Chicago premiere of “Proving Up” has been moved to a later season to be announced at a future date.

“We are very disappointed to have to postpone the rest of the season, especially a beloved and uplifting title like ‘42nd Street,’ which offers pure entertainment of the kind we’re all craving. We couldn’t be more grateful for the outpouring of support that we’ve received from our patrons. All of these cancellations have a financial impact on the company and the show of support from our audiences and artists is profoundly appreciated,” Freud said in a statement.

This follows the announcement in March that the three full “Ring” cycles (an event 10 years in the making) set to begin performances April 13, as well as two performances of “Götterdämmerung” scheduled for April 4 and April 11, have been canceled.

Ticket holders for all performances are being contacted about their options.

In addition, tickets to Lyric’s annual Family Day event (scheduled for May 16) will be honored on May 22, 2021. Backstage tour tickets set for May and June will be honored in the fall; dates and more information will be announced in the coming months.",real

But there are signs that the US economy has already bottomed and activity is starting to come back.

And since equities are forward looking, the gradual recovery of the stock market actually makes sense.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""

Neil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

With the stock market rallying sharply off its March 23 low, the usual cries have started: stocks are missing the economic reality, they're whistling by the graveyard, they're completely divorced from economic fundamentals.

In the last week: the Economist claims ""A dangerous gap has opened between America's stock market and the real economy."" Noted economic pundit Mohamed El-Erian argued that the ""Market keeps distancing itself from the economy."" But that is not so surprising early on.

Admittedly, current economic conditions are poor. Economic output has cratered, leaving widespread joblessness in its wake.

But this does not necessarily mean equity prices should be substantially lower than they are now. The US equity market is not about whether economic conditions are good or bad. Rather, what matters is whether conditions are improving or getting worse.

Today, the evidence is mounting that economic conditions, while far from good, are starting to improve. This is why stocks are up.

Hitting the bottom

Generally speaking, economic conditions can be thought of in two ways: momentum and level of activity. The momentum in the economy represents how quickly conditions are changing in relation to the past while level of activity in the economy measures how far conditions are from their historical averages.

For instance, the US can add thousands of jobs — that shows positive momentum — while the unemployment rate — the level — remains well above its historically average. Momentum needs to be positive in order for the level of activity to improve.

Consider the period following the 2009 recession. It took many years for the level of economic activity to return to potential, as the chart below demonstrates. Even as potential growth repeatedly got revised down, the level of growth hit potential sometime in 2017. Still, this period was an especially good one for stock prices even if for many, it ""didn't feel like"" a recovery.

Today, the evidence is mounting that the level of activity has bottomed – that is, conditions are not getting any worse – and the momentum in the economy has picked up somewhat.

Motor gasoline demand bottomed for the week ending April 10 and has been climbing, retracing about one-third of its decline since mid-March.

Mortgage purchase applications also bottomed for the week ending April 10, similarly recouping about 40 percent of its plunge since mid-March.

Passenger screenings at our nation's airports are also on the mend. The count is now about double the April 14 low, but still 93% off its year-ago level.

Notice that the timing of this improvement precedes the formal lifting of shelter-in-place orders for nearly all states. Thus, it stands to reason that there is room for at least some improvement once formal lockdowns end.

Of course, there are risks to the outlook. Double-dips in the economy are usually about policy choices. Almost always, double-dips are about policy choices after a recovery starts.

For example, in 1982, the economy saw a deep recession after a brief recovery because the Federal Reserve tightened interest rates to take on inflation. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, the policy choice would be to shut parts of the economy down if the virus spread gets worse.

That said, markets have rallied for good reason and the message from stocks is not all that different from what I see in the economy. Economic conditions are no longer getting worse and the re-opening is likely to be measured. Still, we see modest improvement across a range of metrics.

Does that mean things in the economy are good? Of course not. But stocks tend to get better before the economy is ""good.""",real

The nation's banking regulator has indicated that growth in the current financial year (April 2020 - March 2021) will remain in the negative.

Despite facing a revenue crunch itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Finance Ministry has said that there is no proposal to impose a calamity cess to higher revenues in the fight against the pandemic.

Sources in the ministry said that given the economic scenario amid the pandemic, an additional cess will be an ""adversity"" in itself.

A source in the Ministry of Finance said that a proposal like this would prove to be counter-productive, as with the varying degrees of lockdown across the country, sales are already at low volume. Indian PM Narendra Modi imposed the lockdown on 25 March. The national lockdown will continue until 31 May, with some relaxation to industrial, construction, and other service sectors.

""Industry is already facing a deep crisis for want of demand and likely labour challenges that might come in near future due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, tinkering with the taxes or cess would not be a prudent option at all"", the source added.

The Indian government has taken a massive hit to its revenues because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has not released the monthly collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the month of April. In March, the Indian government brought in revenue worth $13 billion.

A Finance Ministry official told Sputnik, ""There has been a very bad impact on GST revenue for the month of April"". The official said that April GST revenue is down by at least 66 percent compared with March.

Due to the impact of the pandemic the ministry is staring at a revenue gap on both direct as well indirect tax collection for the current financial year. The net tax target of $218.12 billion planned in the budget on 1 Feb is difficult to achieve now, contends the ministry official.

However, to compensate for losses on account of the pandemic-led slowdown, the Indian government has recently enhanced this year's borrowing from the budgeted $104 million to $160 million.",fake

As concerts are postponed, sporting events are canceled, schools are closed and tourist hot spots are shut down, experts recommend that even those who show no sign of illness stay home during this time of global pandemic.

That's right: It's advised that you self-quarantine.

Although remaining inside is a good way to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus, and is an important measure to help ""flatten the curve"" of daily cases that put pressure on our health care system, it could lead to a lesser evil: boredom and stir craziness.

What's there to do while stuck indoors? We've compiled 100 suggestions to help make your time quarantined as interesting – and perhaps even as productive – as possible.

One of the pioneers of Afro-funk music, the saxophonist Manu Dibango, has died of COVID-19. He was 86 years old, and died in Paris. Internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song ""Soul Makossa,"" though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. But that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by Dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of American disco — and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna.

Dibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died Tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last Wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. A public memorial will be ""organized when possible,"" the announcement said.

""Soul Makossa"" became a hit in New York after DJ David Mancuso started playing the track at his Loft parties.

Dibango was born December 12, 1933, in the port city of Douala, Cameroon; his father was a civil servant. His parents' marriage was unusual for the time: His mother came from the Douala ethnic group, and his father from the Yabassi, and he later said that he never felt quite at home identifying with either.

When he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in France, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. He paid for his initial rent in Europe with three kilograms of coffee from home — a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. He had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with American jazz. As he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.

While still in France, he began playing in bands — piano, mandolin, vibraphone and, soon enough, saxophone. Dibango made his way to Brussels, where he met one of Africa's greatest bandleaders, Joseph ""Grand Kallé"" Kabasele, a master of Congolese rumba. This was a time of exciting, super-danceable musical experimentation -- Congolese rumba was a blend of American jazz, Cuban rhythms and buoyant African sounds. The genre-bending, free-wheeling music became part of the roots of Dibango's own creativity as a bandleader.

Kabasele hired Dibango to play saxophone in his group, African Jazz. As part of that group, Dibango traveled to what was then Congo, now Zaire, to spend a month with the band. Instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, Tam-Tam, in what was then the city of Léopoldville, now Kinshasa.

Dibango then moved to France where, in the late 1960s and early '70s, he began to forge a career as a significant solo artist. But ""Soul Makossa"" skyrocketed him to international fame.

In the years after the success of ""Soul Makossa,"" he collaborated with many famed international artists, including Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry, Sly and Robbie, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, King Sunny Adé, Youssou N'Dour, Hugh Masekela and Fela Kuti.

""Soul Makossa"" was originally the B-side for a Dibango 45 RPM single; its refrain was something of a branding exercise for ""makossa,"" the funky, jazz-tinged dance genre that Dibango pioneered. (Kossa means ""dance"" in Douala, his mother's native language.)

In 1982, Michael Jackson picked up a version of a line that Dibango declaimed on ""Soul Makossa"" — which Jackson sang as ""mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa"" — on his song ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "" from the album Thriller.

The Cameroonian musician sued the American megastar; Jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. In 2007, Rihanna sampled Jackson's version of the ""Soul Makossa"" line on her song ""Don't Stop the Music."" (Jackson had given her permission, but not Dibango.) Two years later, Dibango sued Jackson again, as well as Rihanna in France; that time, his case failed, due to the earlier settlement.

Publicly, Dibango did not dwell on his wranglings with Jackson; as he wryly told Fresh Air in 1990, ""I think he wanted to say hello to Africa somewhere.""",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
1943,1578,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/20/coronavirus-back-to-school-272592,2020-05-20,Europe learning the dangers of going back to school after coronavirus,"It’s “one of the most difficult things” for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “It’s an impossible balancing task.""

With no easy answers, Europe hasn’t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.

In Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.

To complicate matters, parents aren’t always on board with their government’s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be “guinea pigs,” Reuters reported.

And it’s not just the children who need to be considered.

“We need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

What all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.

When the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.

“In every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,” said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.

But in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.

The emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an “urgent need” for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's “temporarily” linking the syndrome to Covid-19, “based on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.”

But to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.

“The risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,” said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. “It shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.”

Policymakers aren’t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it — a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.

“That’s my biggest fear,” Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.

But the (limited) evidence doesn’t support this.

Ireland’s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”

The one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the “evidence remains limited.”





The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on May 17 that it seemed that “children are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.”

But it’s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.’s doctors' union, when it supported the country’s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.

McKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is ""premature"" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is “problematic” and its contact-tracing system “untested.”

And some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.

Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.

“This puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,” she wrote on Twitter. “Large national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.”

When to reopen the schools has been the “most delicate” issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Université Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.

It’s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L’Echo. He warned of another danger – that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.

Harry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”

For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.

Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.

But the problems don’t stop when schools reopen.

“The challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.”

Returning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.

“As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.

Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”

“One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.

With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Université Libre de Bruxelles: “In any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.”

The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian highlighted to investors last month: that consumers’ perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and that they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.

Specific details could still change, the people said on condition of anonymity, citing the uncertain timing of a recovery from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air travel demand.

Delta has publicly said that it will limit first class seating capacity at 50% and main cabin at 60% through June 30, and earlier announced that it was resuming some flights next month.

“We announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,” Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.

Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry’s main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.

In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.

While major U.S. airlines’ middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.

Still, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an “opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.”

Industrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.

Adding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.

In an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented.",real

It is unclear whether the president is legally empowered to compel the nation’s governors to take such an action. If the White House moves to enforce his order in defiance of opposition by local officials, Trump could force a constitutional clash over one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the First Amendment.

Challenged on Trump’s authority to unilaterally reopen places of worship, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at the briefing Friday the administration would “leave it to faith communities to reopen,” and pointed to “detailed guidance” from the federal government “about the way you can clean your facility [and] promote social distancing.”

But soon after his remarks at the White House, the president was confronted with resistance from state and local executives. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she would not alter her state’s plans to reopen places of worship on May 30, and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also announced her city would ignore Trump’s demand.

“By no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,” Lightfoot said. “And he can’t do that here.”

The CDC’s guidelines, released after weeks of internal debate and scrutiny over leaked drafts, offered detailed measures for how places of worship can start to safely reopen, while advising them to consult with state and local authorities. In contrast with the earlier leaked guidelines, the agency didn’t recommend a phased reopening and instead laid out recommendations for how faith-based communities can promote safety, hygiene and social distancing.

For instance, the agency suggested groups consider suspending or decreasing how often choirs are used, as well as congregant singing and chanting during a service “if appropriate within the faith tradition.” It also recommended temporary limits on sharing religious objects, like books or cups, and to instead photocopy or email prayers to attendees.

Public health experts have expressed concern about the risks related to reopening places of worship. At least two churches in Georgia and Texas that had recently reopened shut down again this week after members tested positive for the virus, and a report from the CDC earlier this week documented how an early March outbreak in a rural Arkansas church spread from a pastor and his wife to about three dozen parishioners, killing three.

Still, Trump insisted Friday that Americans are nevertheless “demanding to go to church and synagogue or to their mosque,” and he predicted “the ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe” when they gather.

“They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else,” Trump said. “The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now, for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less.”

Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, stressed the importance of practicing mitigation measures as places of worship reopen, and said community faith leaders should be in touch with their local health departments.

“I think what we are trying to say with the CDC guidance is there is a way for us to work together to have social distancing and safety for people, so that we decrease the amount of exposure that anyone would have to asymptomatic [people],” she said. “And I see it that way because I know all of you and all of Americans, if they didn’t feel well, they wouldn’t go to church that day.”",real

I’ve sequestered myself away from friends and family, but could my company be unwittingly putting my cat at risk? While there have been some cases of animals contracting COVID-19, it’s rare — and there are precautions that pet owners can take if they’re worried about their furry family members.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means that they can be passed between animals and humans. In New York City, the virus apparently jumped from an asymptomatic human to three lions and four tigers, including four-year-old tiger Nadia, that tested positive for the virus. The zoo says it expects all of the animals to make full recoveries.

Scientists still don’t know for sure what type of animal first passed the new virus to a person. A wet market, where animals, seafood, and produce are sold, in China was thought to be where the novel coronavirus first made the jump. But a January study found the first person known to get sick from the virus didn’t have contact with the market. Another study found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus infecting people was a 99 percent genetic match with one found in pangolins, one of the most trafficked mammals in Asia, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The pangolins might have been an intermediary carrying the virus from bats to humans. Another analysis found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus is 96 percent identical to a coronavirus found in bats, which have been identified as the origin of both SARS and MERS.

There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person.

Even though the virus kicked off a pandemic by being passed from one species to another, it’s not often that coronaviruses make this kind of interspecies jump and continue spreading, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreaks happening now are the result of people passing the virus to one another. Despite that, some animal advocacy groups are worried that misguided fear of COVID-19 patients’ pets could lead to more animals abandoned and mistreated.

There have been a few cases of domestic cats and dogs testing positive for the virus after their owners became sick with COVID-19. A 17-year-old Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested “weakly positive” in February and died in March, but the dog might have simply died of old age, according to reporting from the South China Morning Post. A two-year-old German shepherd in Hong Kong tested positive after its owner came down with the disease, while another dog that lived in the same home didn’t. A cat in Hong Kong and another cat in Belgium have also tested positive. The cat in Belgium “showed clinical signs of digestive and respiratory disease,” according to information from the National Veterinary Services of Belgium.

Cats might be more susceptible to COVID-19 than dogs, according to one study conducted in China that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed. Domestic cats that had been infected with the virus by introducing samples of it through their noses were placed in kennels next to cats that were not infected. The researchers later found that one of the previously healthy cats caught the virus after being near the infected felines, most likely through respiratory droplets — the same way humans can spread the virus through coughing and sneezing. Dogs in the study, on the other hand, seemed to be more resistant to the virus and did not pass it to one another. There was no evidence that the cats shed enough of the virus to give it to people.

Those results should be taken with a grain of salt since it was a small study of animals given high doses of the virus. They don’t “represent real-life interactions between people and their pets,” virologist Linda Saif at Ohio State University in Wooster told Nature.

If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, and sharing food.

If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, sharing food, and having other close contact with your pet to avoid passing the disease on to them. Ask someone else in your household to take care of your pet if that’s possible, and wash your hands before and after touching your pet if it’s a service animal or if you do have to care for it while you’re sick. The same guidelines apply if you think you might be sick but haven’t been tested or are waiting for results. Wearing a mask around your pet is also appropriate if you’re ill, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Because the novel coronavirus can survive for some time on different surfaces, there is a slight chance that our furry friends could carry the virus even though they’re not infected. But the only study to date of how long the virus can persist on surfaces looked at plastic, metal, and cardboard — not animal fur. It’s usually harder for a virus to survive and spread to another person via a porous surface, like hair or fur, because it’s more likely to get trapped in the pores of the material, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The CDC points out that any animal can carry germs that might make a person sick, so whether there’s a pandemic or not, it’s a good idea to wash your hands after handling any animal, its food, or waste.

The bottom line is that we’ll probably need to take similar precautions with our pets as we do with our human loved ones. That means keeping a safe distance when necessary so that we can all stay healthy.",real

Americans want our country to open up safely.

We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.

It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.

We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.

We want a sense of normalcy back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.

We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.

We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.

Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.

Still growing, contagious and lethal

COVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.

Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back — consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment — won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.

We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.

Opening up safely means:

►Following the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.

►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.

►Implementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.

►Having adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected — not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.

►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.

►Obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community

Pause if care capacity is threatened

As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals’ capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.

Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:

►Widespread use of high-quality masks.

►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.

►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.

►Controls at major air and rail entry points.

►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.

►Test, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.

►Coordinated response with neighboring states.

►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.

►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.

Safest to carefully open up

Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:

►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.

►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.

►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.

►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.

►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.

Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:

►Day care centers

►Summer camps and youth sports

►Restaurants

►Schools

►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues

►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds

►TV and film production

►Colleges and universities

►Bars

Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:

►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance

►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation

We believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.

We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.

We believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11. We can overcome this epidemic with smart policies and committed actions.

No infectious disease in a century has exacted as swift and merciless a toll on the United States as covid-19. With no vaccine and no cure, the pandemic has killed people in every state. The necessary isolation it imposes has robbed the bereaved of proper goodbyes and the comfort of mourning rituals. Those remembered in this continually updating series represent but some of the tens of thousands who have died. Some were well-known, and many were unsung.

“Once she had her mind made up about something, Aunt Edna’s was the only opinion that mattered.”

Edna Adams, 105, a woman of faith and conviction, spent her life defying expectations. She lived through the 1918 flu pandemic, women’s suffrage, the Great Depression and two world wars. After her husband died, she lived alone for more than 40 years, moving into a nursing home after her 100th birthday. She fell ill there in April and died days later, becoming the District of Columbia’s oldest coronavirus victim.

1964,133,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/science/coronavirus-drugs-chloroquine.html,2020-03-23,Scientists Identify 69 Drugs to Test Against the Coronavirus,"
Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.
Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.
The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.
To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.
To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.
Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.
In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.
Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.
The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.
On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.
The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.
And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.
One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.
Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.
Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.
And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.
Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.
“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.
On Sunday night, they were still awaiting the first results.",real

Boris Johnson's government closed down the hospitality industry as part of the coronavirus lockdown.

The closure of fish and chip shops has put chipping potato farmers in a nightmare situation.

In a best-case scenario, there are expected to be 95,000 tonnes of surplus chipping potatoes in July.

Farmers are struggling to work out what to do with them, with limited options available.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Britain's farmers are struggling to work out what to do with tens of thousands of tonnes of spare potatoes when their season ends this summer after the closure of fish and chip shops during the lockdown triggered a collapse in demand.

The UK government's decision in March to close large parts of the economy to contain the spread of the coronavirus halted the hospitality industry, with restaurants, some takeaways, pubs, cafes, and bars all forced to shut their doors.

That caused a sharp drop in demand for several foods produced in Britain. That demand has not yet picked back up, with many out-of-home businesses not selling food, and others are operating at a significantly reduced capacity.

The closure of fish and chip shops — a traditional British business — has been acutely felt by UK potato farmers.

The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) estimates that in a best-case scenario, there will be 95,000 tonnes of spare chipping potatoes piled up in stores across Britain at the end of this farming season.

Growers face a major dilemma in figuring out how to deal with this huge surplus of chipping potatoes.

The stores must be empty in time for July, when growers begin work on next season's produce. They are currently full of unwanted potatoes, with very few ways of getting rid of them available to growers.

Growers plan to donate part of the supply to food banks and charities. Some of the potatoes will become cattle feed where possible, and small amounts will be broken down using an industrial process called anaerobic digestion.

However, those measures combined will probably only have a limited impact, the ADHB's Robert Clayton told Business Insider.

""It won't get rid of the surplus, but it will help,"" he said. ""It's a real head-scratcher.""

The financial impact is also set to be significant. The average cost of producing a single tonne is £140, Clayton said.

The National Farmers Union's Alex Godfrey said, ""the closure of fish and chip shops and fast food outlets at the end of March deprived hundreds of thousands of tonnes of potatoes already in store of their planned routes to market.""

Godfrey, a potato grower who chairs the NFU's Potato Forum, told Business Insider: ""Longer-term impacts on the industry are hard to judge, but good, solid businesses have been rocked. I hope they don't tip over.""

It's not just growers of chipping potatoes who are struggling. The closure of fast food outlets in response to the COVID-19 outbreak has left farmers with similarly large piles of spare processed potatoes used to make fries.

A spokesperson for the Potato Processors' Association told Business Insider: ""We have seen volumes of chilled and frozen products, which were intended for food service, fall dramatically. Out-of-home sales have completely stopped.

""Whilst some product can be repurposed or repackaged, the increase in retail sales cannot compensate for the loss of the food service channels and this has led to a reduction in demand for processing raw materials.""

British farmers fear European potatoes could cross the channel

Potatoes are among several foods that are currently in oversupply in Britain.

Brits are being urged to eat more steak after the closure of the hospitality industry led to a collapse in demand for beef. There is also a surplus of milk and wheat, the Food and Drink Federation told Business Insider.

The impact of lockdown measures on potato farmers is being felt in mainland Europe too.

In Belgium, farmers are urging people to eat fries twice a week, the BBC reported, with around 750,000 tonnes of potatoes sat in warehouses across the country due to a sharp drop in demand.

Farmers in the UK fear producers in Belgium and elsewhere will attempt to export their surplus potatoes to Britain.

""The problem is much worse in mainland Europe,"" the AHDB's Clayton told Business Insider.

""What that means is there is the potential for millions of tons of frozen potatoes to come over the channel and bleed out into the British market at a cost so low that it would totally undermine British producers.

""It's making the whole situation a lot more frightening.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Business Insider: ""We are working closely with our potato growers both to support them through this year's planting season.

""We have relaxed competition rules so our farmers can help to feed the nation during these unprecedented circumstances and we are supporting them to sell their produce to different markets as well as being ready to supply restaurants when they reopen.""",real

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants — indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

HCQ breakthrough: ICMR finds it’s effective in preventing coronavirus, expands its use

Three studies find that hydroxychloroquine reduces chances of contracting Covid, so ICMR allows more frontline workers to take it as a preventive drug.

By Himani Chandna

New Delhi: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex body in the field, has found that consuming the drug hydroxychloroquine reduces the chances of getting infected with Covid-19.

As a result, ICMR released an advisory Friday to expand the usage of HCQ — an anti-malarial drug — as a preventive treatment against the novel coronavirus.

The conclusion has been drawn on the basis of three studies conducted by the ICMR.

The advisory suggests surveillance workers, paramilitary and police personnel, as well as medical staff working in non-Covid hospitals and blocks to start consuming the pill as “preventive therapy”.

ICMR had issued an advisory to begin using HCQ in March, but it had drawn criticism for lacking scientific evidence that the drug works against the novel coronavirus.

The studies

According to the advisory, the premier health body undertook investigation at three central government hospitals in New Delhi. While it did not reveal the names of the hospitals, it said the investigation indicates that “amongst healthcare workers involved in Covid-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it”.

The advisory also states that the National Institute of Virology in Pune has found in laboratory testing that HCQ reduces the viral load.

The ICMR also analysed data collected previously, known as retrospective case-control analysis, and found “a significant” relationship between “the number of doses taken and frequency of occurrence of Covid-19 infection in symptomatic healthcare workers who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection”.

It further said “the benefit was less pronounced in healthcare workers caring for a general patient population”.

Another observational study was conducted among 334 healthcare workers at the country’s largest public hospital, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The 248 workers who took HCQ as preventive drug for an average of six weeks had lower incidence of the infection than those not taking the pill.

Which workers will use it now?

Based on the findings of the studies, the government has decided to administer the drug as a ‘prophylaxis’ or preventive therapy to asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-Covid hospitals as well as non-Covid blocks of hospitals earmarked for Covid treatment.

Asymptomatic frontline workers, such as surveillance workers deployed in containment zones, as well as paramilitary and police personnel involved in Covid-related activities will be asked to pop HCQ pills.

Until now, only high-risk individuals, including asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of Covid-19 patients, and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, were being administered the drug. They will continue to consume the drug.

While the dosage will remain the same as before, eight weeks, the ICMR advisory suggests that it can be used beyond that period as well, but with close monitoring.

“With available evidence for its safety and beneficial effect as a prophylactic drug against SARS-CoV-2 during the earlier recommended 8 weeks period, the experts further recommended for its use beyond 8 weeks on weekly dosage with strict monitoring of clinical and ECG parameters, which would also ensure that the therapy is given under supervision,” it stated.

“In clinical practice, HCQ is commonly prescribed in a daily dose of 200mg to 400mg for treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus for prolonged treatment periods with good tolerance,” the advisory added.

Discontinue if ‘rare side effects’ are noted

The ICMR had earlier announced that some side effects, such as abdominal pain and nausea, have been observed in healthcare workers who were administered HCQ.

The anti-malaria drug is often blamed for triggering irregular heartbeat.

However, in the final results of the studies (HCQ prophylaxis among 1,323 healthcare workers), the ICMR found mild adverse effects such as nausea in 8.9 per cent workers, abdominal pain in 7.3 per cent, vomiting in 1.5 per cent, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) in 1.7 per cent and cardio-vascular effects in 1.9 per cent.

The advisory states the drug should be discontinued if it causes the “rare” side effects related to the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, a disease which makes it harder for heart to pump blood to the entire body, and heart-rate disorders.

The advisory mentions that HCQ, in rare cases, can cause visual disturbance, including “blurring of vision, which is usually self-limiting and improves on discontinuation of the drug”.

ICMR has clarified that “for the above cited reasons — heart and vision — the drug has to be given under strict medical supervision with an informed consent”.",fake

When you search using terms like “COVID-19 test” or “coronavirus test,” places that offer COVID-19 tests will be marked on your map. If you start typing COVID-19 into the search bar, you’ll also see the “COVID-19 Testing” search term appear at the top of your search bar, like what you’d see if you started typing something like “groceries” or “coffee shops.”

Apple’s information cards for the testing sites include the site’s hours, address, and phone number, as well as a warning that “COVID-19 testing may require a doctor’s referral and an appointment at the testing center” and a link to the website of the healthcare provider offering the test.

Apple launched a portal to let healthcare providers submit their information

The new testing sites in Apple Maps follow Apple launching a web portal last week to let hospitals and healthcare providers submit their information to be shown on Apple Maps, which was spotted by 9to5Mac.

Google began listing COVID-19 test centers in search results for much of the US on April 17th, and as part of those results, you can see testing centers near you displayed on a map except if you live in Maine, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, or Pennsylvania. But it appears the search company doesn’t show nearly as many test centers when you search for them directly in Google Maps as Apple does on Apple Maps.

Apple’s app shows a number of test centers in Arizona, for example, while searching for a test center on Google Maps for the state doesn’t show a testing center there. However, if you do a Google search for COVID-19 testing in Arizona, Google will surface a map with some test centers in the state. Google tells The Verge that it’s working to bring testing center information to Google Maps in addition to search results.

Apple has also made some updates to its mobility trends site, including adding more cities such as Las Vegas, New Orleans, Portland, Salt Lake City, and San Diego.

Apple and Google have also teamed up on a coronavirus tracking system that will be built into iOS and Android.

Update April 28th, 9:08PM ET: Clarified that Google does show testing centers in maps in search results, but does not show as many centers when searching for them in Google Maps.

Correction: We stated in the latest update to this story that Google search results for COVID-19 testing in New York City surfaces testing centers in the city on a map. It does not. We regret the error. We have changed the example used in this story to Arizona to provide a more accurate comparison of data shown across Apple Maps, Google Maps, and the map surfaced in Google search results.",real

The concept of herd immunity is to stop the transmission of a virus through mass infection — the more people who have antibodies, the quicker mass immunity to the virus will be reached.

But it remains unknown if there's long-term immunity to COVID-19, and reaching herd immunity could lead to more deaths.

Health officials have called herd immunity dangerous and something that could take years to reach without a vaccine.

Sweden's approach to the novel coronavirus seems to rely on herd immunity, and it has kept businesses open throughout the pandemic.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As Americans agitate for the reopening the economy in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, some of them are looking at one strategy to make it feasible: herd immunity.

You don't need to look further than Sweden's anti-lockdown experiment to see why that wouldn't work.

Sweden has taken a controversially relaxed approach to COVID-19. It has not initiated a nationwide lockdown to flatten the curve. Instead, Sweden seems to be pinning its hopes on herd immunity to stop the transmission of the virus through mass infection.

The idea is if more people are infected and obtain antibodies, people will eventually gain immunity to the virus. The country has kept restaurants, schools, and gyms open and urged its residents to social distance and wash their hands.

In the US, the Trump administration has refused to set nationwide distancing rules, leading to scattershot lockdown and reopening efforts.

States across the US issued stay-at-home orders in March, and several governors are starting to reopen businesses — which if done too early, could put residents at risk of COVID-19 surges. Some people calling for economic reopenings, as well as anti-vaccine advocates, have pushed for herd immunity as a way out.

But scientists have called it dangerous rhetoric, saying that in the years people would have to wait for herd immunity to be achieved, hundreds of thousands of people could die from COVID-19. And beyond that, it remains unknown if antibodies from COVID-19 even result in long-term immunity.

No country in the world has reached herd immunity to COVID-19

Data suggests that no place has reached herd immunity to the coronavirus — less than 10% of the world has been exposed to the virus, according to estimates.

Experts say herd immunity requires 50 to 70% of the population to be exposed to the virus. Business Insider's Hilary Brueck reported that without a vaccine, it could take four to five years to reach that point.

In those four or five years, hundreds of thousands of more people could die from COVID-19. And scientists are still uncertain if a COVID-19 infection even leads to immunity.

As of Friday morning, Sweden, which has a population of 10.23 million, had 29,207 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,646 deaths from the virus — a death rate of 35.64 deaths per 100,000 people.

The US, meanwhile, has had 1.45 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 86,607 deaths from the virus. With a population of 328.2 million, the country has a death rate of 26.3 deaths per 100,000 people.

Health officials have called the concept of herd immunity 'dangerous'

Epidemiologists at Johns Hopkins University have called the concept herd immunity a ""dangerous misconception"" and said the US remains vulnerable to the virus. The World Health Organization also criticized the idea of herd immunity on Monday.

""This idea that, 'Well, maybe countries who had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?' This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,"" Mike Ryan, WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said.

Ryan told reporters that humans ""are not herds,"" and such plans around building immunity would lead to only more death.

""I think we need to be really careful when we use terms in this way around natural infections in humans because it can lead to a very brutal arithmetic which does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation,"" he said.

The creator of Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he isn't convinced it's working

The architect behind Sweden's coronavirus plan even said he wasn't sure if the relaxed approach is working.

""I'm not convinced at all,"" Anders Tegnell, Sweden's state epidemiologist, told the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on May 1.

On Tuesday, Sweden even changed one aspect of its COVID-19 strategy, after seeing a high death rate in Swedish nursing homes. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's office announced it would spend about $220 million (2.2 billion kronor) to help protect elderly people in nursing homes from the novel coronavirus.

Sweden and the US are among the 10 countries with the highest numbers of deaths per capita from COVID-19, according to data from Statista. Based on the data, Canada has nearly half the death rate of the US, at 15.1 deaths per 100,000 people.

Sweden is more densely populated than other Nordic countries, but its neighbors' death rates per capita are much lower — Norway has a rate of 4.32 deaths per 100,000 people, and Finland has a rate of 5.2.

Other nations, including Spain and Italy, have higher death rates per capita than the US and Sweden. Both countries have older populations, which affects the death rate, along with other factors, such as testing availability.

Emily Toth Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health told Business Insider reporter Anna Medaris Miller that the only way to gain herd immunity from the virus is through a vaccine.

""This is not just about getting through the current crisis,"" she added. ""If this virus stays around, we need a vaccine to prevent resurgences in future generations.""",real

First the nasty will remain inactive in a non-hostile liquid, wet or moist medium, when that environment dries out the virus can then remain dormant in a dry state for weeks to months depending on the type of virus.

Viruses are expelled out from an infected body into the air after a person sneezes or coughs. Unless covered up a sneeze can eject at over 100 miles per hour and as many as 50,000 individual aerosolized micro droplets of saliva and other moisture can be expelled to travel for a distance between 19-16 feet according to research from MIT.

Uncovered aerosolized blasts of mist expelled from the cough or sneeze will be carrying viruses and bacteria, each of these droplets can hang in the air for minutes or longer depending on the size and weight of the droplet. Anyone who is not infected can walk into these particulates and inhale them to then become infected.

In addition to inhaling the tiny aerosolized mist some of it can land in the moist eye to gain entry to the body and begin infection, all without the uninfected person knowing, and for the majority of people without them even thinking that the eye can be a portal to infection. Should an uninfected person touch a contaminated object/surface such as a door knob, elevator button, countertop, pen, or ATM/debit card station button they may even pick up disastrous microbes that have been left behind by an infected person. The potential to pick up a live virus while out in public is scary and enormous.

""These tiny droplets float through the air and you can get a cold, the flu or another illness when you come into contact with them. Sneeze and cough germs spread far and fast,"" explained Dr. Stephanie Kelleher, a Geisinger family physician.

Recently, a physician in Wuhan China says that he is positive that he became infected with the coronavirus via his eyes when he was working with infected patients. It is rather easy to do as explained above. Simple walk through an area where someone has coughed or sneezed, or even touching a contaminated area and then rubbing your eyes/mouth/nose will immediately re-activate the virus in the moisture.

Even the Ebola virus has been confirmed to be living in human eyes. Potentially any wet, moist non-hostile surface/medium/environment outside of the human body can become a host to any virus or bacteria. When that dries up they will still remain there in a dry state in wait to be picked up by someone who then will touch their mouth, nose, or eyes which will put the virus back into a wet and warm environment where it will readily begin to quickly replicate and infect its new host almost immediately.

How long a virus or bacteria can survive outside in a dry state without a host varies, in the case of TB bacteria that can be for decades. It has not yet been determined how long the coronavirus can live outside a host, but conservative projections are at least 5-7 days. Keep in mind it could be longer as in the case of HIV it has been shown to live in a dry state for far longer than that.

To protect yourself, especially when out in areas where infection is known, you should wear an N95 rated face mask with a moisture barrier, and you should consider wearing eye protection as well. Wearing gloves, washing your hands frequently and keeping them away from your face and food until you do is most important. Be aware of where you are and the potential places where transmission of disease can occur such as those touched and shared by literally thousands of people which includes retail store card terminals, pens, school/work/library desks, elevator buttons, store door handles, public restrooms, public transportation poles/handles, shopping carts, crosswalk buttons, playground equipment, handrails, steering wheels, touch screens, computers/laptops, and more, they are all just crawling and teaming with a legion of microbes.

State Rep. Sonya Harper (D-Chicago) introduced legislation last month that would allow cannabis dispensaries to deliver marijuana to both medical pot patients and recreational customers. Now, she’s calling on Gov. J.B. Pritzker to take immediate action amid the rising public health crisis.

“I would be happy to see if the governor maybe could make a special executive order allowing that, or us being able to get that legislation through maybe quicker than normal this year to provide for that,” said Harper, who co-sponsored the bill that legalized pot statewide at the start of the year.

That landmark piece of legislation didn’t include a provision allowing deliveries, though lawmakers discussed the prospect while it was being drafted.

Curbside pickup allowed

Harper’s push to allow pot deliveries in the wake of the coronavirus crisis comes two weeks after officials allowed retailers to temporarily sell medical marijuana outside stores to protect patients who may be susceptible to COVID-19. The state’s more than 100,000 medical users can also have a registered caretaker pick up pot products for them.

Harper acknowledged that setting up a system for deliveries would be “more difficult” than allowing those curbside sales.

“It would entail basically giving all municipalities and everybody across the state the ability to open up deliveries,” she said. “It would also be creating a new type of license.”

Pritzker’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment, but state officials appear to be mulling whether to open up deliveries. A representative of a major Illinois cannabis firm, who asked not to be named, said the company has been included in some recent conversations.

“The state has been open-minded to evaluating and implementing new processes for the convenience of medical patients during this crisis, like curbside pickup, and conversations about how home delivery would work have definitely been part of that dialogue,” the industry insider said.

Margo Vesely, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said her group has recently been lobbying lawmakers to allow deliveries to medical patients.

“I think that we have to really hone in and focus on those that have those compromised immune systems and really look out for them at these times,” said Vesely. “Medical patients, if they have a weakened immune system, can’t be going into the dispensaries. And if they don’t have a caretaker, they’re stuck.

“So it would be really beneficial for them,” she added.

Harper noted that she’s recently seen people waiting to get inside dispensaries and that curbside sales are also attracting lines of cars. As officials institute strict measures to promote social distancing, she said “mobile delivery is probably needed in this time more than ever.”

However, Harper said it’s unclear whether home deliveries could be established without legislative approval, like curbside pickups. Passing her bill quickly through the Legislature also seems unrealistic, as the coronavirus has shut down sessions in Springfield for weeks.

“As it stands right now, the bill hasn’t even been heard in committee yet,” said Harper. “So we really haven’t even had a chance to discuss it, to even see any way that the bill needs to be changed or amended to meet the different needs of the different municipalities.”

“I think if we had the political will we could get together in a room and put that together now, but I do see things like that maybe taking time to figure out the details.”",real
2026,1829,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-22-mutated-virus-coronavirus-outbreak-in-northeast-china.html,2020-05-22,Experts: “Mutated” virus involved in new coronavirus outbreak in northeast China,"(Natural News) A new cluster of COVID-19 cases has emerged in the northeastern provinces of Chinaâs Rust Belt region, with doctors noting that the virus involved in the new cases is behaving differently compared to the one first encountered in Wuhan late last year.

According to Qiu Haibo, an expert in critical care medicine who is part of the National Health Commission expert group, the virus found in patients in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang was unique, in that its incubation period was longer compared to that of the patients in Wuhan.

In addition, Qiu noted that while Wuhanâs patients suffered severe lung, myocardial, renal and intestinal damage, the cases in Chinaâs Rust Belt mainly showed lung damage, with very slight damage to the heart, kidney or intestines.

The Rust Belt cases too, were largely asymptomatic, in the sense that they did not manifest any elevations in their temperature and only exhibited minor symptoms such as sore throats and fatigue.

âThis causes a problem, as they donât have any symptoms. So when they gather with their families they donât care about this issue and we see family cluster infections,â Qiu told state broadcaster CCTV, Tuesday.

Qiu, in his interview, said the strain of the virus found in the Rust Belt clusters was probably imported from abroad, which could explain the differences between the Wuhan and Jilin cases.

According to authorities, the first case of infection was reported early this month in Jilin Province, which borders Russia and North Korea. This infection then spread to the cities of Jilin, Shulan and Shengyang.

State media Xinhua, meanwhile, reported that the province logged a total of 135 confirmed locally transmitted cases, of which 108 had been discharged.Â Twenty-fiveÂ individuals, as per local media, are still hospitalized.Â (Related: New coronavirus strain may be emerging and causing survivors to get REINFECTED.)

As a response to the new cases, Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for strengthened measures to contain the infection, including the halting of public transport services, the sealing off of residential compounds in some of the cities in the region, and the creation of an emergency response team.

Five hundredÂ medical professionals have also been tapped to help address the outbreak, as confirmed by Liu Qizhi, director of the Jilin municipal health authority.

Experts confirm: Coronavirus may be mutating

Perhaps due to intensified worry and speculation over a second wave of potentially fatal coronavirus infections, public speculation on coronavirus mutations have since flooded the internet.

Experts, however, say this fascination with viral mutations may be a case of much ado about nothing.

As with all known viruses, it is normal for the coronavirus to change and mutate, according to Nels Elde, an associate professor of human genetics at the University of Utah.

âViruses mutate. Thatâs one of the things that makes them such a successful entity,â Elde said in an interview with ABC News, noting that because viruses are constantly copying themselves, it is inevitable for some of its copies to manifest random mistakes or mutations.

âThe word âmutationâ to people means something bad because itâs got that connotation to it,â Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology at Columbia University Medical Center, noted.

According to Racaniello, âmutationâ in the context of viruses simply means a change in their genome sequence.

âIt doesnât mean that itâs necessarily bad for you at all,â Racaniello said.

Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor at the University of Hong Kongâs School of Public Health, had the same sentiment, noting in an interview with BloombergÂ that while some changes in the genetic structure can, in theory, lead to changes in the virusâs structure or its behavior, many mutations lead to no actual and discernible changes at all.

Lucy Van Dorp, a research associate with the University College Londonâs Genetics Institute, meanwhile, noted in an interview with Al Jazeera that while 198 mutations of the virus have been found so far, the vast majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are likely to be neutral or without impact.

As of press time, the coronavirus has infected 5,127,125 and killed 333,398Â according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
