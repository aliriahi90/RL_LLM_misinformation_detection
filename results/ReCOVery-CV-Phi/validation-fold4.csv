Many economists predicted a V-shaped journey for the economy: A sharp drop, then a quick bounce-back as the virus faded and the economy regained health.

Others envisioned a slower, U-shaped course.

Now, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans press to reopen the economy, some experts see an ominous risk: That a too-hasty relaxation of social distancing could ignite a resurgence of COVID-19 cases by fall, sending the economy back into lockdown. The result: a W-shaped disaster in which a tentative recovery would sink back into a “double-dip” recession before rebounding eventually.

“The push to reopen the economy is making a W-shaped recovery very much more likely,” said Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at the Harvard Kennedy School.

In Frankel’s view, any widespread reopening should wait for a sustained drop in death rates and the broad availability of tests. No one is completely safe until an effective treatment or vaccine can be produced and widely distributed — a scenario that’s likely many months away.

Frankel said he also worries that the government might prematurely withdraw financial aid to the economy, thereby weakening the pillars of any tentative recovery.

“A W-shaped recovery is a distinct possibility,” said Yongseok Shin, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis and a research fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Unless the reopening is carefully managed with extensive testing and voluntary social distancing, infections will rapidly rise in many localities.

“People will then hunker down for fear of infection, and local governments will re-impose lockdowns, quashing any economic recovery we will have had to that point.’’

A double-dip recession would significantly heighten the risks for an already debilitated U.S. economy. Congress has provided roughly $3 trillion in aid — by far its largest rescue ever — to help households and companies survive the next few months. That short-term aid, though, assumes any recovery will last. If a second downturn were to flare up, it’s far from clear that Congress would be ready to offer trillions more to enable businesses to survive yet another round of months-long shutdowns.

Nor do many companies have the cash reserves to cushion against a second recession. And just as threatening, a double-tip downturn would sap the confidence of individuals and businesses that is essential to an economic bounce-back. If consumers don’t trust that a recovery will last, many won’t resume spending, and the economy would struggle to rebound.

On Monday, plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe’s newly reopened cities as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain allowed people to eat outdoors. All faced the delicate balance of restarting battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.

In the United States, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has urged caution in reopening the economy. Powell has warned against taking “too much risk of second and third waves’’ of the virus.

For now, the economy is essentially in free-fall. It shed a record 20.5 million jobs in April. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. The gross domestic product — the broadest measure of output — shrank at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March and is expected to post an astounding 40% annual collapse in the current quarter. That would be, by far, the worst on record dating to 1947.

Facing a catastrophe in an election year, Trump and many Republican allies are eager to ease restrictions and restart the economy. They say the use of masks and other protections should allow many businesses to safely reopen under certain guidelines. Trump has openly backed protests that are intended to compel governors to “liberate’’ their states from lockdowns.

But The Associated Press reported last week that many U.S. governors are disregarding White House guidelines. Seventeen states didn’t meet a key benchmark set by the White House for beginning to reopen businesses: A 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates.

Texas’ Republican lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, has gone so far as to suggest that restarting the economy might be worth the risk of some additional deaths.

“There are more important things than living,’’ Patrick said in an interview with Fox News. “I don’t want to die, nobody wants to die, but man, we got to take some risks and get back in the game and get this country back up and running.”

Most Americans say they’re wary of trying to return to business as normal now. A Pew Research Center survey found that 68% said they feared that state governments would lift restrictions too soon. Just 31% wanted restrictions lifted sooner.

“The idea that you just turn the spigot back on is just ridiculous,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the consulting firm Grant Thornton. ”It’s still a COVID-tainted spigot. No one wants water from a poisoned well.’’

Many businesses are also tempering their optimism. The data firm Womply found that even in Texas and Florida, states that are being especially aggressive about reopening their economies, businesses are moving slowly. Womply found only a “small-to-negligible drop’’ in the share of Texas and Florida businesses that remain closed.

“This could signal that previously closed businesses may have trouble figuring out how to open with new guidelines, attracting patrons, or may be closed indefinitely,” Womply concluded.

At Big Buzz, a health care marketing consultancy in Denver, CEO Wendy Phillips is expecting “more a W-shaped than a V-shaped’’ rebound. Phillips has reduced her staff from eight to six, two of whom kept their full-time jobs only after the government delivered a $105,000 loan under a rescue program for small businesses.

“There’s so much unknown looking forward,’’ Phillips said. “I think it’s going to be a good two or three years, at a minimum, of recession.’’

Frankel at the Harvard Kennedy School and others worry that state and local governments, hemorrhaging tax revenue, will be forced to make growth-stunting cuts just as a recovery might be straining to gain traction.

Another threat is the prospect of bankruptcies and cash shortfalls for companies and households. Some have been able to defer rent and other payments but will eventually have to repay their landlords and other creditors in full.

Likewise, U.S. authorities declared premature victory over the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak, only to see it return, deadlier than before. In the current pandemic, South Korea eased restrictions as cases dropped. But on Saturday, Seoul had to shut down nightclubs, bars and discos after dozens of infections were linked to club goers.

Last week, researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health warned that easing stay-at-home orders and allowing people to mingle more freely would mean that “new COVID-19 cases and deaths will rebound in late May.’’

The Columbia researchers predict a resurgence of cases two to four weeks after states begin to reopen.

“The lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of COVID-19 until it is well underway,” said the lead researcher, Jeffrey Shaman.",real

Opinion contributors

Editor's note:The following letter to Congress is signed by 110 former members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and governors. The project was organized by the Issue One ReFormers Caucus, co-chaired by former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Connie Morella, a Republican from Maryland; former U.S. Ambassador to India Tim Roemer, a Democrat from Indiana; and former Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn.

As former public servants and concerned American citizens, we are deeply worried about the twin threats of a pandemic combined with severe economic peril, and we strongly encourage our government to work together for common purpose for the United States.

First, we can all agree that our democratic republic must efficiently function and serve all Americans, especially those most vulnerable to sickness and those unemployed from devastating economic fallout. Recovery will demand the best of our spirit, determination and perseverance.

A trusted and effective Congress — one that lives up to its Article I duties — is a vital part of this solution.

Second, we hope America will unite in its efforts to protect people from contracting the virus, care for those who have taken ill and help others through painful economic hardship.

Furthermore, while there will be a deeply passionate and fully competitive election in November, let’s work to ensure fair and secure access to the ballot for all eligible voters.

We know history books will closely examine how our elected leaders handle this pandemic and what action is taken to strengthen our republic, and, in turn, prepare our institutions for the next national challenge.

Congress, to its credit, has acted quickly to pass three stimulus bills signed by President Donald Trump to address the COVID-19 crisis. However, both the House and Senate must make important institutional reforms to restore the people’s trust, work smarter and more securely with technology, retain and hire a diversified and highly trained staff, and spend more time performing their constituent jobs and less time raising campaign money.

Work has already begun to bring the House to the 21st century thanks to the bipartisan leadership of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, who recently passed nearly 30 recommendations to strengthen and modernize the House of Representatives. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and other House officials have devoted precious political capital to begin this modernization process, and we applaud and thank them for their efforts.

The Senate also needs to engage on these issues, and much more needs to be done to restore the institution overall. More than 70 former senators recently published a letter encouraging the Senate to explore efforts to work in a bipartisan fashion and exert their constitutional authority.

Build on pandemic relief efforts

Especially during this international health pandemic and looming global recession, it is critical that our elected leaders build on the bipartisanship of COVID-19 relief efforts and model the cooperation demonstrated by the evenly bipartisan group of 12 representatives of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, led by Rep. Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., and Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., and address the vital needs of the country. We are hopeful that once this crisis has subsided, there will be an even broader, bicameral conversation about reinforcing Congress’ Article I, Section I role as our nation’s primary legislative authority.

Strong Congress is essential

If this pandemic has taught us anything about our political system, it’s that a robust and resilient Congress — one that operates as the first branch of government — is essential to the safety and security of our republic and all its citizens. To quote Alexis de Tocqueville’s ""Democracy in America,"" “The greatness of America lies not in being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”

In this spirit, we hope that leaders in both chambers of Congress will harness the moments following this grave and uncertain time and boldly lead to restore the institution. Our country will be stronger for it.

12,1088,https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-natural-jump-from-bats-more-likely-than-lab-leak-2020-4,2020-05-15,"Scientists found an even closer match between the new coronavirus and a virus in bats — more evidence that it jumped naturally, like other viruses","When Chinese authorities first reported an outbreak of a new coronavirus, many disease scientists had the same thought: History was repeating itself.

The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest example of a well established phenomenon — viruses commonly jump from an animal host to humans. This type of cross-species hop, called a spillover event, also led to the outbreaks of Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both of those viruses originated in bats, and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus.

A study published in February found that the new virus, whose scientific name is SARS-CoV-2, shares 96% of its genetic code with a coronavirus called RaTG13 that circulates in Chinese bats. This week, researchers found an even closer match: A study in the journal Current Biology describes a previously unknown coronavirus named RmYN02 that's 97.1% similar to SARS-CoV-2. It was found in the bats in China's Yunnan province between May and October 2019.

Despite these close matches, however, neither of these viruses are the new coronavirus' direct ancestor. Lingering questions about exactly where and when the outbreak started have given rise to a range of unsubstantiated theories.

""Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 there have been a number of unfounded suggestions that the virus has a laboratory origin,"" Weifeng Shi, the lead author of the recent study, said in a press release. He added that the discovery of RmYN02 provides ""strong evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being a laboratory escape.""

Although it's not impossible for a stored sample of a bat coronavirus to leak from a lab, it's far more likely that this one jumped naturally from bats to an intermediary species before making its way into our population.

Infectious-disease researchers had been warning of the potential for exactly such a spillover event for years.

Many spillovers have occurred in the past

Experts have long agreed that the next pandemic was always a matter of when, not if.

""The world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war,"" Bill Gates said during a 2018 conference. ""If history has taught us anything, it's that there will be another deadly global pandemic.""

The year prior, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned of the inevitability of a ""surprise outbreak"" of a new disease.

""There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases,"" Fauci said during a 2017 speech at Georgetown University, specifically highlighting the threat of unknown diseases.

""The thing we're extraordinarily confident about is that we're going to see this in the next few years,"" he added.

Three out of every four emerging infectious diseases come to us from other species; these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases.

The 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic — swine flu — started in pigs then killed nearly 300,000 people. People have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry. Other pandemic influenza strains, including the 1957 ""Asian flu"" and the 1968 Hong Kong pandemic, likely started in birds, too.

And in the last 45 years, at least four epidemics — including SARS — have been traced back to bats.

""Bats and birds are considered reservoir species for viruses with pandemic potential,"" Bart Haagmans, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands, previously told Business Insider.

Researchers traced the SARS coronavirus to a population of horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province; humans caught it from civet cats at a wet market in Guangdong. The virus killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 in eight months.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), also a coronavirus, first passed from bats to dromedary camels. It circulated in the camel population undetected for decades before jumping to humans in 2012. So far, 858 people have died across 28 countries from the illness, which is marked by a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

In Southeast Asia, fruit bats were the original hosts of the deadly Nipah virus, which emerged in Malaysia in 1998, then again in India in 2001. The bats passed it to farmed pigs, which gave it to people. Patients experienced headaches and vomiting; many slipped into a coma and died.

Fruit bats in Africa have played a major role in Ebola outbreaks as well. The worst Ebola outbreak in history, however, came from a population of long-fingered bats. More than 11,000 people died in that epidemic from 2013 to 2016.

Bats are prolific virus carriers

Scientists estimate that there are 1,400 living bat species.

""The great diversity of bats also means they host a great diversity of viruses,"" Nancy Simmons, curator of the American Museum of Natural History's mammology department, said during a media briefing on April 22.

Bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of viruses than other mammals, according to a 2017 study. In fact, a 2019 study found that bats carry more than 200 coronaviruses. They're ideal hosts if you're a virus because bats fly across large geographical ranges, transporting diseases as they go without getting sick themselves.

Bats pass these virus to other species via their poop or saliva, and the unwitting intermediaries can transmit the virus to humans in the same way.

A study published in March 2019 predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in China.

""It is highly likely that future SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an increased probability that this will occur in China,"" the researchers wrote at the time.

That's because the majority of coronaviruses — those that affect humans and animals — can be found in China, and many bats ""live near humans in China, potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock,"" the authors said.

Millions of people are exposed to zoonotic viruses annually

Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, told NPR in April that his colleagues are ""finding 1 to 7 million people exposed"" to zoonotic viruses in Southeast Asia each year.

""That's the pathway. It's just so obvious to all of us working in the field,"" he said.

Dennis Carroll, former director of US AID's emerging threats division, told Nautilus Magazine in March that research from EcoHealth Alliance suggests ""we're looking at an elevation of spillover events two to three times more than what we saw 40 years earlier.""

That's because of the growing human population and the way we're encroaching on wild areas.

""The single biggest predictor of spillover events is land-use change — more land going to agriculture and more specifically to livestock production,"" Carroll said.

He added, ""whatever future threats we're going to face already exist; they are currently circulating in wildlife.""",real

“unite behind experts and science”

On Twitter, Thunberg asked people to join a digital strike by posting a photo of themselves along with the hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline. Just as she does when it comes to climate change, Thunberg urged people to “unite behind experts and science” to address the current public health crisis posed by the novel coronavirus.

“We’ll have to find new ways to create public awareness & advocate for change that don’t involve too big crowds,” Thunberg tweeted. “Listen to local authorities.”

This is one of the unintended consequences of Stay-At-Home orders that conservatives were mocked for bringing up in March.

The rate of suicide is absolutely staggering. One doctor who called it “unprecedented” said that the medical facility where he works has seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in just four weeks.

Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus. Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The head of the trauma in the department believes mental health is suffering so much, it is time to end the shelter-in-place order. “Personally I think it’s time,” said Dr. Mike deBoisblanc. “I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering.”… …”We’ve never seen numbers like this, in such a short period of time,” he said. “I mean we’ve seen a year’s worth of suicide attempts in the last four weeks.”

Officially, the medical center supports the lockdowns to reduce the spread of the virus, but it’s clear that the side effects of the lockdown are causing significant harm.

Job losses, social isolation, and hopelessness are going hand-in-hand with state-imposed lockdown orders. In some states, these orders are being extended far beyond the initial timeframe–“15 Days To Slow The Spread” which became “30 Days To Slow The Spread” to “Lock Down Until There’s A Cure.”

Contra Costa County Crisis Center Executive Director Tom Tamura said that generally speaking, the vast majority of people feel better after calling the crisis line. He also said that although calls are up, they’re not up significantly, which he attributes to people being more isolated from their support network.

“I think people have found themselves disconnected from the normal supportive networks that they have, churches and schools and book clubs, you name it,” Tamura said. “And that, coupled with the closure of some counseling services, people were maybe in a little bit of shock.They were trying to weather the storm a bit but as that isolation has grown people have come to realize this isn’t a sprint it is marathon.” Source: ABC 7 News (Emphasis Added)

This is utterly heartbreaking. People are intentionally doing harm to themselves because governments have prioritized physical health over mental health.

People are isolated from their social groups which means that someone that might catch a warning sign that something is wrong and urge an individual to make that call to the crisis center just isn’t there to do that. How many suicide attempts could have been stopped just by allowing people to move in their social circles?

When this whole thing began and we didn’t know much about the virus because it was new and China literally destroyed their data to protect reputation, closing things down for a couple of weeks to make sure our healthcare system wasn’t overwhelmed was an acceptable suggestion to protect public health. That was around 70 days ago.

We know more now, and it turns out that a lot of what we knew was wrong.

The lockdowns may have slowed the spread of the virus, but it was never going to stop it completely. Some scientists are saying that the coronavirus will continue to come back as a seasonal illness.

In the meantime, we’ve completely changed our society, schools are shut down, businesses may never reopen, we aren’t allowed to go to church, and the government has chosen which jobs are “essential” and which are not.

But the results of the never-ending lockdowns were inevitable–an increase in suicides, businesses closing, and hopelessness.

It’s time to reopen.",fake

J.B. Pritzker to roll back his executive stay-at-home order.

The Illinois Department of Public Health also said an additional 2,088 people have tested positive for COVID-19, raising the statewide case tally to 92,457. The death toll stands at 4,129.

And for the third straight day, the Northeast region of the state met the medical criteria set by Pritzker’s administration to advance to the third phase of his reopening plan when his stay-at-home expires at the end of the month. That would mean many non-essential businesses including salons and barbershops could reopen with health precautions in place.

Those Phase 3 reopening requirements include holding the coronavirus testing positivity rate under 20% for two weeks. The Northeast region, which includes Chicago and the collar counties, was at 18.8% Saturday.

The state received 23,047 test results Friday, and more than 561,000 tests have been administered overall. Pritzker has highlighted testing capacity as another key factor in reopening, with several new testing sites opening this weekend.

But even as plans are laid to gear the economy into motion, the governor’s office has said the peak of the pandemic could extend well into the summer.

The virus has been confirmed in all but two Illinois counties, while Cook County is registering the most confirmed cases of any county in the nation. More than 1,800 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the state this month alone.

Reopen Illinois protesters rally again

Despite the grim figures, a vocal contingent of demonstrators rallied again outside the Thompson Center in the Loop and the State Capitol Building in Springfield demanding Pritzker reopen the state immediately.

With a roster of conservative speakers including radio host Erich “Mancow” Muller, people in the crowd chanted “Right to go to church” and toted signs declaring “Jesus is my vaccine,” a day before a handful of churches planned to hold services in defiance of Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which bars gatherings of more than 10 people.

Other signs declared “Freedom is essential” and suggested Pritzker’s extended stay-at-home order is part of a political scheme to subvert President Donald Trump’s reelection effort.

“They said this was all about flattening the curve. I think we flattened the curve,” Illinois Republican Party Chairman Tim Schneider said. “These are the snarky things he says: ‘This is all about science... and the peak isn’t going to hit until the middle of June.’ Why did they take down all the beds in McCormick Place already then?

“You know what this is all about. This is about taking down President Trump in November,” Schneider said.

A concurrent protest was held outside the State Capitol in Springfield.

Connie Unger, one of the several protesters at the downstate rally who carried a “Fire Pritzker” sign, said the Democratic governor has “overstepped his boundaries” with his stay-at-home orders.

“He is against our state, he has another motive and I don’t believe that he is a true patriot,” Unger said. “His motive is to be the most liberal governor so that he can run for a higher office.”

At both protests, a few signs were spotted comparing Pritzker, who is Jewish, to Adolf Hitler. A handful of similar anti-Semitic signs were seen at the first major Reopen Illinois rallies held May 1, drawing condemnation from the Auschwitz‑Birkenau Memorial and State Museum.

Pritzker has said most Illinoisans have been following his guidelines, and has framed the protesters as “outliers.”

“Today, as millions of Illinoisans followed the public health guidance in place to keep everyone safe, a loud minority gathered in an attempt to get headlines for their hateful, ignorant, anti-Semitic protest against science,” Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in an email. “We know the majority of Illinoisans who remain vigilant in this fight against COVID-19 are the reason we’re flattening the curve and those gathering in defiance of the medical experts have them to thank for their health and safety.”

Researchers have confirmed that there are several effective methods for decontaminating the N95 masks worn by health professionals so that they can be used more than once, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday.
A substantial body of research already showed that the masks, designed for one-time use, can be reused in a crisis. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March authorized reuse because of shortages driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent weeks the Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency approvals for several systems of mask decontamination.
None of these rules or methods are intended for the cloth masks recommended or in some locations required for use by everyone in public. The C.D.C. advises regular washing of homemade fabric masks in a washing machine.
Earlier research had not, of course, involved the new coronavirus. The new research, done at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and used live novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, to test the mask material. The study determined which decontamination procedures were most effective, and how they affected the integrity of the masks.
Vincent Munster, one of the authors of the new work, who collaborated with other government researchers and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the work built on more than a decade of studies of decontamination. “We showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,” and for bacteria, he said.
The research was posted on MedRxiv, a website where scientists have been posting articles submitted for publication elsewhere that have not yet been through peer review. But N.I.H. publicized the study because it could be helpful to health care professionals in the midst of a crisis, and it was validating and extending previous work, not suggesting untried methods.
Dr. Munster and his colleagues tested four methods of killing the virus: UV light, dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and ethyl alcohol. Of those methods, they did not recommend ethyl alcohol because although it killed the virus, it degraded the mask material.
The researchers first tested samples of N95 material to which live virus had been applied. That work was done in a biosecure lab. After treatment, they cultured virus particles from the material to see if the shielding remained effective in limiting transmission.
Then they tested the same methods on whole masks without the virus to determine whether their structure and functioning were damaged after rounds of decontamination.
Dr. Munster said that even if decontamination worked perfectly, but the mask no longer fit “then obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.”
Vaporized hydrogen peroxide, a method often available in large hospitals, was effective, and left the masks still functioning for at least three rounds of decontamination, as did UV light.
Dry heat, at 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit, was effective, but the masks withstood only two rounds of decontamination. Dr. Munster said that “vaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that’s available.” However, he said, a nursing home might not have that, while for dry heat, what’s needed is basically an oven.
Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, said in an email that she thought the new research was an “excellent contribution.” She said it was “helpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.”
Another recent study from Canadian researchers, also not yet peer reviewed, confirmed the value of decontamination. It included masks of different brands and found that the material of the mask was still effective after 10 rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination.
One of the authors of that paper, Dr. Anand Kumar at the University of Manitoba, said that his procedure was slightly different from Dr. Munster’s in that it did not test the structure and facial fit of the mask, only the filtering ability of the material.
The recommendations and findings in the two papers are intended to be useful for institutions that have health care workers wearing N95 masks. With personal protective equipment in short supply at many overwhelmed hospitals, some front-line workers, including doctors and nurses, have complained that masks were rationed.
The public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment.
“And if they do, they shouldn’t try decontaminating them,” Dr. Kumar said.",real

The Minneapolis company reported Wednesday that comparable-store sales, which include online purchases, rose 10.8% for the three-month period that ended May 2.

That was fueled by a 12.5% jump in the number of items customers bought with each trip to the store as families made major restocking runs, but fewer of them.

“Last quarter was unlike anything I have ever seen,” Target's CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a conference call. “It was intense. It was volatile. It was stressful for our guests and for the country.""

The pandemic has widened an already growing rift between companies that deftly followed consumers online, and those that have struggled.

J.Crew, Stage Stores, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney have all sought bankruptcy protection in recent weeks.

A years-long campaign by Walmart and Target to challenge Amazon.com online was, as it turns out, a dry run for the pandemic.

Target had already transformed its 1,800 stores into distribution hubs, putting it in a better position than even Amazon.com to keep supplies flowing.

Target's stores were directly involved in supplying goods for 80% of online sales. Same-day services, such as curbside pickup at stores for things ordered online, nearly tripled.

The company has 5 million new users on its website, and 2 million have begun relying on Target's services like curbside pickup for things ordered online.

Target picked up market share in all five of its merchandise categories, Cornell said. Sales of items like furniture and electronics surged 20%. It was the same for groceries.

Clothing sales, a high-margin category for retailers, slipped during the quarter, but that business began to rebound at the tail end of the quarter. Cornell cites government stimulus checks for that late bump in discretionary spending.

It is unclear if other retailers, particularly those that are still closed, saw the same uptick with the arrival of those checks.

As with other retail companies operating in a pandemic, costs soared as well. Target spent and additional $500 million on things directly related to the outbreak. It's bumped up hourly pay for workers by $2. It has now extended emergency pay for those workers to July 4. Target also spent money to sanitize stores and warehouses, new protections for workers an signage for customers to ensure social distancing.

Cornell said those costs will be the new reality going forward.

“There is going to be a premium on creating a safe sanitized shopping environment,"" he said. Shopping while minimizing human contact is the new normal, he said, referring to drive-up and curbside pickup.

Target reported an 11.3% increase in revenue, which hit $19.62 billion for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $19.02 billion. Net earnings slid 64% to $284 million, or 56 cents, or 59 cents when adjusted for non-recurring events. That's far better than the per-share profit of 44 cents that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.

Callaghan O'Hare | Reuters

Coronavirus cases are rising in Texas as the state plans more steps to restart its devastated economy during the pandemic. After new reported cases rose by about 1,000 per day in mid-April, they started to climb in May, reaching a new single-day high of about 1,450 on Thursday. While Texans moved more freely around the state after it allowed stores and restaurants to reopen on May 1 with capacity restrictions, the figures could reflect improving testing capacity. Cases are ""definitely increasing but it's not to the point where it's overwhelming our health care system,"" said Dr. Brian Reed, professor and chair of the department of clinical sciences at the University of Houston College of Medicine.

When Texas partially rebooted its economy at the start of the month, it became the most populous state to do so up to that point. Along with the other largely Republican-led states that lifted restrictions designed to slow the pandemic in late April and early May, Texas looked to buoy a state economy wrecked after most businesses closed their doors. Texas will next allow businesses such as gyms to open on Monday with capacity limits.

The decision comes with immense risk. Experts say more freedom of movement leads to expectations of increased infections — though people's decisions to continue distancing and wear face coverings in public could limit the spread. This week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Congress that states could see ""little spikes that might turn into outbreaks"" if they restart their economies too soon. In Texas, roughly 1.8 million people have filed for jobless benefits in the last seven weeks. That comes out to 9.2% of workers covered by the state's unemployment program.",real

According to officials in Shizuoka prefecture, whose boundary with Yamanashi prefecture Mount Fuji straddles, three of four main routes to the volcanic mountain’s peak will be shut down during the summer months, which comprise the climbing season.

The decision comes after officials in the Yamanashi prefecture announced that the Yoshida trail, the most popular route for climbing Mount Fuji, would also be closed.

The cabins along the routes, which are used by resting climbers, will remain closed this summer.

""The routes open in summer, but this year we will keep them closed” from July 10 to September 10, a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP. ""We're taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus,"" the official added.

This is the first time that the UNESCO world cultural heritage site has been closed since 1960.

Japan hasn’t experienced a severe coronavirus outbreak compared to parts of Europe and the US. So far, there have been more than 16,000 cases of the virus in the county and at least 744 deaths.

However, states of emergency remain in place in the cities of Tokyo and Osaka, the northern island of Hokkaido and other areas which have been hit hardest by the disease.",fake

Now, Tribeca Enterprises (the company behind the Tribeca Film Festival), IMAX, and AT&T are partnering to bring a summer movie series to as many drive-in theaters as possible in the US.

Tribeca Drive-In will feature a curated selection of movies both old and new, alongside special music and sporting events, according to a press release. The series kicks off on June 25th, although programming information — including dates for specific cities and what films will be shown — isn’t available yet. More info will be available in the coming weeks, the companies say. The series will use IMAX’s digital remastering process to enhance both the image and sound quality of the films that play in drive-in theaters.

“I know many drive-ins really appreciate the opportunity to work with the Tribeca Enterprises team”

Throughout the series, Tribeca will work with local vendors to support small businesses. Drive-in theaters have big community components, and the series wants to ensure that those communities are represented to make it feel unique. Tribeca Enterprises, AT&T, and IMAX are hoping that people’s pent-up demand to get out of the house and watch movies in a community setting will propel people into theaters.

Approximately 5 to 10 percent of drive-in theater owners across the country are seeing increases in revenue, Jim Kopp, the administrative secretary for the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association (UDITOA), told CNBC. But that’s still a relatively small number. Several theaters have faced forced closures in states that prohibit mass gatherings right now.

Just under 10 percent of drive-in theaters in the United States have remained open, John Vincent, president of the UDITOA told CNN. Despite those theaters remaining open, concession stands have closed and additional social-distancing protocols are being implemented. Theaters may be open for business, but one of the crucial ways those theaters make revenue (selling concessions) remains down for the count. Teaming up with companies like IMAX and AT&T could help more theaters reopen and drive business up in theaters that are currently operating.

“I know many drive-ins really appreciate the opportunity to work with the Tribeca Enterprises team to bring content to our screens in this much-needed environment,” Vincent said in a press release.

The big question is whether new movies from studios like Disney, Warner Bros. (owned by AT&T), and Universal will be available for theaters to play this summer. Many movies have been delayed until later in the year, with some moving a full year into 2021 release dates. Two of the earliest movies set to be released this summer, Tenet and Mulan in July, could still face delays if the studios (Warner Bros. and Disney, respectively) don’t think the audience turnout is there. If that’s the case, drive-in theaters may have to rely on repertoire programming, smaller independent films, and special events to drive people’s cars into the lots instead of big-budget pictures.",real

Special for USA TODAY

For millions of kids and teens in America each year, summer camp is a cherished part of childhood. It’s often a young person’s first foray with freedom. Or maybe it’s a chance to run wild in the great outdoors, playing all day, and splurging on s’mores around the campfire all night.

Whatever the case, it’s a moment in the short window of being a kid, where everyone involved can make lifelong friends and lasting memories – and parents can get a little break, too.

But this year?

“It’s another thing that COVID-19 has taken away,” says parenting expert Jennifer Kelman.

Kelman, a mom of 10-year-old twins and a licensed clinical social worker, says she’s getting this question dozens of times every day right now, while she and many other families try to figure out what to do with summer camp plans. “With shelter-in-place orders, this pandemic has taken the connection away for children and adults,” she adds.

State of the summer camp

The U.S. has more than 14,000 year-round and summer camps serving an estimated 20 million campers annually, along with more than a million camp workers. Together, it fuels an $18-billion industry according to the American Camp Association. Now, nearly everyone involved is stuck at home trying to figure out what’s going to happen next with the pandemic. Parents are desperate for answers, while camps are scrambling to come up with a plan to avoid complete shutdown or, worse yet, the collapse of their entire business.

Can technology save the day?

Already, at least 22 programs across the country have announced they will hold some form of “online camp” this summer. Just like the internet turned office workers into remote employees overnight, “online camps” hope to bring activities and fun to kids while keeping them safe from the ongoing health crisis.

Unhappy campers:Parents are concerned amid summer camp uncertainty

Pivoting to online courses is a big transition for kids who expected to be spending weeks socializing and making new friends. Many parents also wonder if more screen time is good for kids at this point.

“My kids are changing before my eyes because of how much screen time they’re getting between online learning and just trying to physically connect with her friends,” says Sacramento-based attorney and working mom of two, Leslie Sindelar. “So I’m feeling very anti-tech right now. If our traditional summer camps aren’t available, do I concede and sign them up for online camp anyway?”

Virtual summer camps

The Oregon-based outdoor-adventure camp company, Trackers Earth, was among the first to take its after-school and summer classes online last month, shortly after shelter-in-place orders left many parents – and kids – desperate for options. They named the virtual options Trackers Spark. “Our online camps are live, small group interactive webinars,” Trackers Co-Founder, Tony Deis told me over the phone. “It’s usually a ratio of one teacher or guide for a maximum of eight students, and they (the instructors) bring one-of-a-kind skills and expertise to every single day, just like they do in real life.”

Trackers Spark courses are tailored to kids ages 4 to 14, and they offer just about every area of interest you could think of, from outdoor safety and survival to arts and crafts, even role-playing and light-hearted “secret agent” training. Most online camps are 30 minutes to an hour in length and run $5 to $25 dollar for a single class, with discounts if parents buy them as a series.

Deis says the idea isn’t to distract kids with a screen, but rather to use a computer or tablet as a window to the same kind of camp instructor they would follow at an in-person camp. “We want to keep kids active and connected. What each camper does varies based on the topic, but every program is more than passive screen time,” Deis explained.

Right now, all of the Trackers Spark courses are offered in Pacific time zones via private, secure Zoom video calls. Trackers is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, but Deis says they’ve already had campers join in from New York, Maryland, and even Sweden to take the live classes.

“He shooed me out of the room, before it started,” parent Terrie Jarrell says regarding her 12-year-old son’s experience in the recent “Realms: Elite Guard Campaign” class. “He's not forthcoming with details, other than his party fought ogres for breakfast food.”

“These classes have been completely transformative. Particularly while we're sheltering in place,” agreed Oakland mom Saray McCarthy, who says her 7-year-old son is partial to the Evil Secret Agent Academy: World Domination class. “He LOVED the idea of being an evil spy and is really into being the double agent. Trackers creates such an immersive experience, and he just loves that.”

Not all virtual camps are interactive

Just like every in-person summer camp is different, each online camp offers its own special take on what kids and teens might want too. Deis says most online camps break down into three categories:

Videos kids watch. These are often subscriptions. Webinars with large groups, where the interaction is something 20+ kids can do together. Small group, interactive webinar-type classes.

Deis says his company chose to go the No. 3 route because, “it lets kids be social, connecting with each other, and getting personal interaction with the teacher.”

Another camp founder I spoke with has created a different kind of virtual online camp called Happy Camper Live. It’s packed with web series, live programs, and a 360 virtual tour of their Camp Starlight sleepaway camp in Pennsylvania, no VR headset required. The video activities are taught by real camp counselors – but none of them are interactive – on purpose.

“What we offer is not a Zoom room,” says Happy Camper Live founder Allison Miller. “That might work well for some of the other camps, but we already know that parents are going to be the real camp counselors this summer, and we’ve created a critical resource for both kids and parents. The whole concept is for kids to get inspired and go out and do something new.”

Happy Camper’s videos are typically two to six minutes long and cover a wide range of activities such as magic tricks, sports drills, arts and crafts projects, performing arts, and outdoor skills. Each day, there are a handful of free videos, and a yearly subscription costs around $12.

Miller says their goal is to offer kids and parents dozens of different options for fun things they can learn, master, and do on their own – or with each other. “The whole concept is for kids to get inspired and go out and do something,” Miller added. “We can’t bring every kid to summer camp, but we can bring summer camp to them.”

Parental supervision required

Typically, one of the best things about sending the kiddos off to camp is that the adults get a bit of breathing room. That’s missing from online camps, and most of them suggest a parent or guardian be on-hand – or at least nearby – for additional support.

All of the camp owners I spoke with reiterated that these online courses are not a replacement for parenting. In other words, don't stick them in front of a screen and zone-out for the next hour or two. Trackers Spark tells parents before they register for any course, that the classes need some level of guardian supervision, which they rate as follows:

Phone On – Guardians must be in the same house with a phone on for notifications. Example – Martial Arts

Eyes On – Guardians must be close enough to observe. Ready to help. Example – Cooking

Hands On – Guardians with the camper to offer immediate help and co-guidance. Example – Woodcarving

Will online summer camp work?

Will online summer camp work? Absolutely. It already is – as a “recess,” or maybe even “re-set” – of sorts for parents running out of ideas to keep kids entertained, active, and from fraying their last nerve.

The classes I’ve audited have been fun, informative, engaging, and an obvious relief for kids and parents alike. Last week, I learned how to walk in the woods without making any noise. I loved that, and so did the half-dozen 7- to 10-year-olds learning “tracking skills” along with me. There were also a few times kids seemed so excited just to have others youngsters their own age to talk with, it really drove home the need for continued connection with people their own age.

As a parent myself, I do have one word of warning here: Make sure each instructor is properly vetted, as you would with anyone you trust to care for your child, virtual or otherwise. Most in-person camps require counselors to get background checked, fingerprinted, and bring specific skills and experience to the environment. Make sure online camps offer the same. Then – take a deep breath – and get ready to learn some fun stuff, too.

All of these online options offer more than any of us could possibly dream up ourselves, so why not use what’s available at our fingertips to help us all get through these trying times? To echo what one of the camp owners said, “when kids are exposed to a lot of different things, it helps them find their passion,” even if that passion this year – is right in our own backyards.

Buyers of US-extracted liquefied natural gas (LNG) may cancel up to 60 percent of July orders, as the energy industry is reeling from a global glut caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Bloomberg reports, citing a survey of traders.

There are five LNG export terminals in the United States, operated by four companies. They could get requests to scrap from 35 to 45 cargoes scheduled to be unloaded in July, according to traders' estimates. That compares with 75 shipments delivered to global customers in January and 61 in April.

Houston-based Cheniere Energy, the biggest US producer of LNG, has been asked to cancel 30 cargoes due for loading in July from buyers with long-term supply contracts, industry sources told Bloomberg. It has received just 10 such requests for June. It is understood that similar requests have been submitted to other American exporters.

Analysts note that LNG exporters are currently operating at negative profit margins because of weak demand, limited storage capacity and a fall in prices coupled with higher transportation costs due to the relative distance of US-based terminals from destination markets.

This means that customers may well keep cancelling orders through October of this year, before European customers will be able to free up space in storage sites to receive more imports.",fake

Throughout the Scriptures, we are warned about apocalyptic events that will precede the second coming of Jesus Christ, and a lot of people are wondering if that period of time is now upon us. All over the Internet, people are engaging in all sorts of speculation and lots of really bizarre theories are being thrown around, and this is causing a great deal of confusion. But all of this confusion is not necessary, because the Bible is actually very clear about what is coming.

Jesus had quite a bit to say about the time just before His return, and He specifically instructed His followers to watch for certain signs. He wanted us to understand that He knew about all of these things in advance, that He has a plan, and that He is in control.

So there is no need to fear. In fact, Jesus told us these things so that we would not be afraid.

Three of the key chapters where Jesus discusses the events of the last days are Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21. To set the stage for the rest of this article, let me share just three quick verses from Luke 21…

Could it be possible that we have entered a time when these things are starting to be fulfilled?

To answer that question, let’s examine some of the global events that are currently unfolding…

#1 Wars And Rumors Of Wars

War is coming to the Middle East, and it might be coming a lot sooner than most people think.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very eager to annex portions of Judea and Samaria before the U.S. election in November, and the coalition agreement that he reached with Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz allows him to do that as early as July.

I believe that it will happen at some point in the coming months, and the Palestinians are openly warning that such a move will mean war. In fact, Mahmoud Abbas is so upset about this pending annexation that he just publicly backed out of all previous agreements with the United States and Israel…

In an emergency meeting in Ramallah Tuesday, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas announced that due to Israeli plans to annex parts of Judea and Samaria, all agreements with Israel and the U.S. are null and void. This would include the Oslo Accords, which was the basis for the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.

And Jordan’s King Abdullah just told a German newspaper that annexation “would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”…

In an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, the Jordanian monarch reiterated that a two-state solution was the “only way forward” as a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. “What would happen if the Palestinian National Authority collapsed? There would be more chaos and extremism in the region. If Israel really annexed the West Bank in July, it would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,” said Abdullah.

This is something to keep a very close eye on, and we also need to keep in mind that a major war between Israel and Iran could erupt at literally any moment as well.

#2 Earthquakes

Our planet continues to become increasing unstable, and my regular readers know that I am particularly concerned about the west coast of the United States. It is just a matter of time before “the Big One” hits California, and this week we did see two very alarming quakes strike just off the California coast…

The first measured at a 4.7 magnitude. It hit at 11:56 p.m. Sunday about 163 miles west of Eureka. The second earthquake was stronger, measuring a 5.5 magnitude hitting in the same area about 160 miles west of Eureka at 12:02 a.m. Monday. The second quake was at the same depth as the first earthquake at about 6 miles down.

Overall, there have been 2,668 earthquakes in California and Nevada over the last 7 days, and that is definitely unusual.

Meanwhile, large earthquakes continue to strike other areas of the globe with frightening regularity. For example, a magnitude 6.2 quake just rocked the Mediterranean Sea, and that made headlines all over the globe.

In the days ahead, the shaking is only going to get worse, but most people don’t understand what is happening.

#3 Volcanoes

I have written about Mt. Popocatepetl near Mexico City many times, and it has roared to life once again.

In fact, it is being reported that it was shooting hot ash 20,000 feet into the air on Wednesday.

Keep a very close eye on this volcano, because someday a catastrophic eruption of Mt. Popocatepetl will result in the worst disaster in the history of Mexico.

Of course Mt. Popocatepetl is far from alone. According to Volcano Discovery, 24 volcanoes around the globe are erupting right now, and dozens more are showing signs of unrest.

#4 Crazy Weather Patterns

You may have noticed that global weather patterns have gone absolutely nuts.

We are seeing record setting droughts in some parts of the world, in other areas we are witnessing unprecedented flooding, and global food production has been greatly disrupted by one unforeseen event after another.

For instance, this week India and Bangladesh are preparing for Super Cyclone Amphan to make landfall. On Monday night, that storm “officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal”…

Millions of people in India and Bangladesh are bracing for what is now being called the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal. Super Cyclone Amphan is anticipated to make landfall in less than 36 hours, bringing destructive winds and heavy rain to a region already struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. According to CNN, Super Cyclone Amphan officially became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal on Monday night, after intensifying with sustained wind speeds of up to 165 miles per hour. Even though Amphan has weakened slightly the storm is still the equivalent of a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane, with winds speeds up to 115 mph.

#5 Armies Of Locusts

Billions of locusts have been traveling in giant swarms the size of major cities across large portions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. These mammoth swarms can travel up to 90 miles a day, and when they descend on a farm they can eat all of the vegetation in as little as 30 seconds.

I have written about these enormous locust armies numerous times, and they keep making headlines all over the world. This week, video of these locusts “blocking out the sun in Iran” was being widely shared on social media…

Terrifying footage of an apocalyptic swarm of locusts blocking out the sun in Iran has emerged after it was revealed the military could be called to fight a plague that may destroy at least $7billion (£5.7bn) worth of crops. The chilling video shows a haze formed of millions of the bugs covering the horizon on a motorway in the south of the country.

#6 African Swine Fever

Before COVID-19 came along, African Swine Fever was the most serious pestilence affecting the planet.

There is no vaccine, there is no cure, and it is killing pigs all over the globe at a staggering rate.

In fact, approximately half the pigs in China and approximately one-fourth of all the pigs in the entire world have already been wiped out by this disease.

Needless to say, this is having a tremendous impact on the global food supply, because much of the world relies on pig meat as a primary source of protein.

#7 Famines And Food Riots

You know that things are bad when even the United Nations is using the word “biblical” to describe the famines that are beginning to emerge around the globe.

The head of the UN World Food Program, David Beasley, is publicly warning that we are heading into “the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two”, and he is telling us that we could soon see approximately 300,000 people literally starve to death every single day…

“If we can’t reach these people with the life-saving assistance they need, our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period”, he upheld. “This does not include the increase of starvation due to COVID-19”.

We have already witnessed very large food riots in Africa, and now they are starting to happen in South America.

For example, check out what just happened in the capital of Chile…

The coronavirus hit Chile at a particularly delicate time. Back in October, the Chilean military deployed tanks and troops onto the streets of Santiago – the Chilean capital – and President Sebastian Pinera declaring a state of emergency to quell a violent uprising triggered by – of all things – a hike in metro fares (can you imagine that happening in NYC?). Now, some of the nation’s poorest are rising up against the government again in a violent protest movement over the lack of government assistance. Specifically, food shortages have left thousands of Chileans with nothing to eat, and the mandatory closures have made it impossible for them to work or buy food.

Global food supplies have gotten very tight, and they are only going to get tighter in the months ahead.

#8 Economic Collapse

Countries all over the world have locked down their economies in 2020 due to fear of COVID-19, and that has plunged the entire global economy into a deep depression.

Here in the United States, more than 36 million Americans have already lost their jobs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago says that the real rate of unemployment in the United States is now 30.7 percent, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is projecting that U.S. GDP will fall by 42.8 percent during the second quarter of this year.

Now that our economic bubble has burst, the dominoes are just going to continue to tumble, and the days ahead are looking quite bleak.

#9 The Coronavirus Plague

This is the greatest public health crisis in a hundred years, and it looks like this pandemic is going to be with us for many months to come.

Already, there have been more than 5 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 300,000 people have died. Many had been hoping that the worst was behind us, but the head of the WHO just told us that Tuesday was the worst day for new cases “since the outbreak began”…

“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. “In the last 24 hours, there have been 106,000 cases reported to WHO – the most in a single day since the outbreak began. Almost two-thirds of these cases were reported in just four countries.”

Jesus specifically warned us that there would be “pestilences” during the time before His return, and I believe in the future we will see even worse pandemics than this one.

In fact, many of the signs that I discussed above will get worse in the days ahead. Just as birth pains increase in frequency and severity as the time for birth gets closer, we should expect many of the signs that Jesus warned about to increase in frequency and severity as well.

But even in the midst of all the chaos that is coming, God will be moving, and I believe that the greatest revival in all of human history is still ahead of us.

Thanks to the coronavirus crisis, the United States is now facing its highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.

The economy shed 20.5 million jobs in April, and the official unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent—its highest peak since the government began tracking the modern data series in 1948, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

April’s numbers are more on par with the 1931 unemployment rate, based on data drawn from the Historical Statistics of the United States.1 For the moment, we’re living in Hooverville.

Jordan Weissmann/Slate

But today’s headline figure may understate the actual extent of joblessness at the moment. In an FAQ accompanying today’s report, the BLS explained that due to a data-collection mistake, up to 8.1 million Americans may have been categorized as employed but not at work, when they likely should have been classified as unemployed or on a temporary layoff. If you factor those individuals in, the April unemployment rate would jump to about 19.5 percent, the government’s statisticians wrote. That would place us roughly in 1932–33 territory.

Jordan Weissmann/Slate

If all this weren’t depressing enough for you, remember: Millions more Americans have filed unemployment claims since the middle of last month, when this data was actually collected. The picture we’re looking at now is still relatively bright compared with the current reality.

One notable thing about April’s job losses was that they occurred across virtually all industries. The largest chunk by far was in leisure and hospitality (including hotels and restaurants), which saw payrolls decline by more than 7.6 million, or more than one-third of the total. Retail contributed another 2.1 million. But basically every corner of the labor market—from construction to manufacturing to health care to professional services like law—saw declines. There were a handful of subsectors that saw small increases, but the only big gains were supercenters and warehouse clubs (think Walmart, Target, and Costco). We’re not looking at a few industries that have frozen up, but really a whole economy.

It’s not exactly a shock that we’re facing mass unemployment at a moment when entire states and industries are effectively shut down. But the new jobless figures do suggest that the government’s coronavirus response has fallen short in at least one key way. Much of the economic relief bill Congress passed in March, the CARES Act, was designed to keep workers attached to their jobs where possible. The fact that we are now staring at Great Depression–like unemployment numbers anyway should be regarded as a failure. Yes, it’s likely that even more people would be out of work were it not for efforts like the Paycheck Protection Program. And it’s possible that there has been some rehiring as businesses have received their government aid. But the continued flood of unemployment claims suggest that things are, if anything, getting worse rather than better.

The one reason these figures are not a complete catastrophe is that Congress created extremely generous $600-per-week federal unemployment benefits. As a result of those, many Americans will receive more in government aid each week than they were earning at their jobs. States have had difficulty coping with the avalanche of claims, and many people have had to wait weeks to receive their money, if they haven’t been prevented from applying entirely by crashing websites. But as of April 18, almost 19 million Americans at least had their applications processed. Hopefully most of the jobless are actually receiving some substantial help by now.

The federal unemployment benefits are only scheduled to last through the end of July, however. If they expire and people still aren’t ready for a return to work (or shopping or eating out), families are going to find themselves in increasingly desperate financial situations, and the economy will likely sink further into trouble.

In the end, this is just one month’s jobs report. What made the Great Depression the Great Depression was the yearslong slog through economic devastation. The question for us is whether the government can finally contain this virus and engineer a reasonably fast economic recovery. Unfortunately, it’s not at all clear that it will. Republicans in Congress currently don’t appear to have much appetite to pass further significant relief or stimulus measures, such as fiscal aid to states, extended federal unemployment benefits, or a bigger, better wage subsidy program to keep people connected to their work. Meanwhile, the White House seems to be betting its response on Jared Kushner’s ability to speed up the development of a vaccine, which … God help us. If none of this changes soon, there’s a good chance we really will be headed for a long depression of our own.

But quite a few intelligent young people are not taking the virus seriously. They continue to go out and gather in large groups. It’s a serious threat to their well-being and that of their families and friends.

I’m not here to scold, but I hope my experience can help you young people consider why we need to take serious precautions to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.

I was born during the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918. My sister died in the epidemic. I doubt my mother ever recovered from that loss. Yet, my mother went on, living another half-century despite health problems, the Great Depression and World War II.

Opinion

Mother was just one generation removed from slavery. In 1919, she and my father moved the family from Alabama to Chicago to escape Jim Crow and racist terror. All three of her surviving children became well-educated. My brother and I fought in the U.S. Army in World War II and became decorated veterans.

Battles are not won in weeks

Now we’re going to have to fight this pandemic as hard as we fought back then. The president has claimed the virus will magically disappear any day now. In reality, no historic battle is won in a few days or weeks. It’s a good thing he wasn’t president during World War II or you’d all be speaking German right now, and I wouldn’t be speaking at all.

They call my age group the Greatest Generation because we fought in World War II. But now, in my old age, I believe you young people will have to be the new Greatest Generation.

I am infuriated by the dismissive attitude of certain politicians towards older Americans. Especially now, as we seniors are threatened by this virus, they act like we are expendable. But we have as much right to be here, living our lives, as anyone else.

My contemporaries and I have a vast reserve of talent, ideas and positive experiences. We have been change-makers, and we are not done yet. Talk to your own grandparents if you are fortunate enough to have them with you. Ask them what they’ve been through.

It’s not enough to respect your elders. You’ve also got to protect them. Make sure they have what they need, but keep your distance for the time being. Follow the advice of scientists and doctors: Stay home, wash your hands, cover your face, and so on, to prevent spreading the virus. To practice these rules is a form of resistance to historic injustice.

Back in World War II, we made a united effort to defeat our enemies. The future of democracy was at stake. Every family sacrificed. We saved cans to be turned into ammunition. We grew vegetables in every yard. Butter, meat, sugar, coffee and other necessities were rationed to send to the troops overseas. We looked out for each other.

We united even though we were still segregated inside the Army. We said among ourselves, “We’ll solve that problem once we get back home.”

Protecting everyone — and our election

I’m proud of the young people who are now organizing on the South Side, delivering food and supplies to those in need. They are acting with purpose and leadership.

Besides our elders, we must protect those who have been locked up. We on the outside should be demanding protection for them. We’ve got to treat them fairly, and with all due haste, release as many as possible, get them access to healthcare and make sure they are housed.

I worry, too, that the president may seize this opportunity to delay or even prevent the national elections next fall. We need a national system of alternative methods for voting, such as mail-in ballots. I remain optimistic that we can mobilize the electorate and defeat the incumbent.

Our great cause in the days of my youth was the defeat of tyranny worldwide. It took an international effort. Every young person came forward. We did it then and we can defeat this enemy today.

At 101, I’ve been lucky to live beyond the typical lifespan. I hope we can inspire each other, and stay politically alert and active.

Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah rejected an offer by Real Madrid in 2018, the Egyptian national team assistant coach has revealed. In an interview with OnTime Sports Hany Ramzy said Salah broke the news during training.""I was talking to Salah and he told me that Real Madrid had sent him an offer. The offer was really good, but Salah discussed it with me and Mr Cuper [the former coach of Egypt's national football team ], and he decided to stay with Liverpool because he was comfortable there"", Ramzy told OnTime Sports.

It appears that Salah's decision to stay at Anfield paid off. The Reds, who lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final that year, performed brilliantly the following year. Not only did they win the most prestigious club football tournament in the world last season, making an historic comeback against Barcelona in the semi-final, they finished second in the Premier League losing one point to champions Manchester City and Salah played the key role in the club's success. This year Liverpool has looked leven more stunning. The Reds are on top of the Premier League table with a 25 point lead and are on the way to winning their first domestic trophy after a 30-year title drought.

The English Premier League plans to resume on 12 June after a long break caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, not all players are happy about it. Chelsea striker Willian is keen to return to the pitch, but only when it is safe to do so. Britain has the second highest death toll (34,466) from the infectious disease after the United States (90,113). The number of confirmed cases stands at 240,161, according to real-time statistics website Worldometer.",fake
104,1887,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/05/covid19_becomes_a_political_disease.html,2020-05-23,COVID-19 becomes a political disease,"Just as the coronavirus begins to wane, another dangerous pathogen is infecting America – COVID-19 politics.

In the early days of the pandemic, state governors walked in lockstep, ordering lockdowns to mitigate coronavirus infections and safeguard hospitals from being overwhelmed with patients.

Now that the number of new cases is flattening, politics are taking over, with states veering in different directions. Science no longer appears to be in the driver’s seat.

Blue states are extending stay-at-home orders, while red states are opening for business.

Two playbooks are in motion.

Red states are scrambling to revive the economy as quickly as possible, to get people back to work so they can feed their families. They fear the country, already facing a recession, may spiral into a depression if too little is done, too late.

Blue states say they are continuing quarantines to save lives, putting the nation’s economic recovery on the back burner. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said there’s “no cost that is too high to save any one precious life.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is locking down the nation’s second largest city for another three months and said it won’t fully reopen until a vaccine becomes available.

The endgame for the red and blue states is the November election.

If the economy has stopped bleeding and unemployment numbers are improving, giving hope for a return to normal, the public will likely reward President Trump with a second term.

But if storm clouds remain on the horizon, with the economy sputtering or worse, offering little hope the crisis will soon end, the public may hold the president responsible and vote for new leadership to steer America to safety.

It’s not hard to believe that some Democrats are rooting for the worst. It was just eight months ago that comedian Bill Maher said he hoped America would suffer a recession. “I really do,” he enthused. “We have survived many recessions. We can’t survive another Donald Trump term.”

Democrats had few cards to play regarding the economy prior to the pandemic. Unemployment was at a historic low for African Americans, women, and Hispanics. The numbers have since flipped. Unemployment now is at a historic high, dealing the Democrats back into the game. This November, it will be “It’s the economy, stupid” all over again.

Given the political advantages that accrue to the Democrats from a poorly performing economy, the question arises, “Are blue states extending lockdowns to purposely delay an economic recovery, as a means to unseat President Trump?

This may seem cruelly cynical, but far leftists once bankrupted New York City to try to enact their socialist agenda. The political strategy was crafted by socialist academics Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven. New York City, at the time, was providing very generous welfare benefits, but not everyone who was eligible to receive them was enrolled. Cloward and Piven published an article explaining how this situation could be exploited to create a political crisis that “could lead to legislation for a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty.”

Far left activists embraced the strategy. Over the next several years, they boosted the number of single-parent households on welfare from 4.3 million to over 10.8 million. New York City could not afford the additional cost and was forced into bankruptcy in 1975.

This sad incident offers an important teaching moment. Far leftists are willing to do just about anything – including willfully destroying the economic wellbeing of the largest city in America – to advance their socialist policies. Given this history, it’s not a stretch to think the blue states might implement a Cloward-Piven strategy to impair America to advance their political standing in the November election.

Of course, the blue states will never acknowledge such a diabolical scheme exists and will argue their decision to continue the quarantines is necessary to save lives.

The political lines are already forming. As the economy worsens, and it will, expect red states to place blame on blue states for waiting too long to reopen businesses, killing off jobs that otherwise would have been saved. Blue states will fight back, condemning red states and President Trump for opening businesses too early, causing the death of thousands of Americans.

In the midst of the political furor that’s building, don’t be surprised if a wild card changes everything. Some examples:

· The Trump Administration is moving at “warp speed” to bring viable treatments and vaccines to market to counter the coronavirus. Successfully doing so will allow America to return to normal and derail the Democrat playbook. · Some epidemiologists are predicting a second COVID-19 wave this fall. If states are forced again to shutdown businesses, it will deepen the economic crisis and play into the hands of the blue states. · Obamagate. In the 1974 election, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Republicans lost 49 seats in the House and four seats in the Senate. It could happen again, with the tables turned. Expect Democrats to utilize the “coronavirus defense” and claim the issue is a smokescreen to divert the public’s attention from the Trump Administration’s “mismanagement” of the coronavirus outbreak.

America, already overwhelmed by the Wuhan coronavirus and its destructive path, is sure to see its political temperature rise in the coming months due to the election, compounding the public’s maladies. Unfortunately, there’s no vaccine to protect them from COVID-19 politics and sheltering-in-place will not forestall its transmission.

Originally published on www.healthimpactnews.com

Johns Hopkins University had predicted that Taiwan would have the second most COVID-19 cases in the world, due to its close proximity to Mainland China.

But astonishingly, in spite of being only 80 miles from the coast of China with over 400,000 of its 24 million citizens working in China, as of mid-April, the country only had 400 cases of COVID-19, and only 6 deaths. And the vast majority of their 400 cases came into the country from abroad.

All of this has happened without shutting down the country with lock downs, and with almost all of its businesses continuing to operate. Is Taiwan doing something else the rest of the world is largely missing?

This question will no doubt be asked for months or even years into the future, but it is a question well worth asking, given the devastating effects to the economy that have resulted from more restrictive measures such as the United States took.

The first thing to note is that while President Trump is now looking seriously at pulling out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan was never part of it. They were not allowed to join due to the WHO's pro-China stance.

According to the Taipei Times, Taiwan's CDC tried to warn China and WHO on December 31, 2019 about possible human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, while China was still denying that such transmission was possible.

That same day, Taiwan started policies to monitor travel from China to reduce the chance of having the coronvirus come into their country. They were one of the first countries to restrict travel from China at their borders.

Taiwan had bad experiences from the 2003 SARS (another coronavirus) outbreak in China, and as a result their hospitals were well supplied with equipment to handle any outbreaks. This SARS situation had reportedly taught them to have a healthy distrust in China and the World Health Organization to accurately report facts, and to have their own plan in place for future outbreaks.

But unlike the U.S. and many other countries, Taiwan did not quarantine the entire nation. They focused on quarantining travelers coming in from abroad in their own homes, while the rest of the nation went about their business, with some restrictions in place such as wearing face masks, and practicing social distancing.

It is hard to argue with their reported results so far, with so few actual cases and very few deaths. They kept the country open, and did not destroy their economy.

John Ransom, reporting for TownHall Finance writes:

Protests in the streets, oil trading at negative numbers, rapidly spiraling unemployment, locked-down international travel and trade: I think we can all agree that by any barometer, including these, the world has failed the Wuhan flu test. Why the world's answer to the China flu has been so disastrously wrong, ill-thought out and ignorant to reality can be left to future post-mortems. But after spending literally trillions on public health over the decades to prevent just such an occurrence, it's clear by now that the world's investment in public health professionals was wasted. We can debate whether the cost was worth it, but there is no denying that the cost has been beyond anyone's imagining. Some may argue that in such a crisis, experts faced a no-win situation where they had to either trade lives for the economy or the economy for lives. To that I give a one-word answer: Taiwan. Taiwan is the other ""China"". It's a small island off the southern coast of China, called the Republic of China (ROC). It was created as a bastion of ""free"" China as the Communist Party took over mainland China (PRC). The island may be small, but the country is a regional and worldwide powerhouse. It's the 21st largest economy in the world (19th if counting by PPP), despite having a population of just 24 million. It ranks 11th in GDP per capita, comparable to Denmark and Sweden. It's also an important partner with Communist China as one of the leading investors, trading partners and bankers for the PRC. Consequently, Taiwan hosts quite a bit of contact with the PRC. For comparison sake, the United Sates saw about 3 million visitors from China in 2018, while Taiwan hosted 2.6 million visitors from China in 2018. That's why the results from Taiwan in fighting China's Wuhan flu--as they call it in Taiwan--is so extraordinary. Worldwide there have been 321 cases of COVID-19, or Wuhan flu, per million people. In Taiwan there have been just 0.3 cases per million people for a total of 422 cases, with only six total deaths. Equally important is that while the Taiwanese economy has been damaged by the global shutdown, their domestic economy and society has remained open. (Source and Full Article Here.)

We report these results as a comparison to what other actions have been taken in other countries, that have had far more disastrous results. We are not necessarily endorsing everything that Taiwan has done, just reporting the facts about their response and their results so far.

Many questions are still unanswered. Did the actions the Taiwan Government take cause a much lower rate of reported infections of COVID-19? Or are there other factors involved that kept their infection rates lower? Since the SARS outbreak more than 15 years ago was so severe there, was there some natural immunity against coronaviruses involved? Did their location closer to the equator with more sunlight and warmer temperatures this time of year play a factor?

About the only thing we do know for sure, is that the vaccine gods and their global leaders like Bill Gates and Dr. Fauci and the WHO cannot take credit for Taiwan's success, because they never were able to successfully develop a vaccine for SARS, and they have successfully kept Taiwan out of the WHO.

Writer Marc A. Thiessen offers his perspective:

This pandemic has provided us with a clinical trial in the healing power of freedom. We can now compare two control groups in the form of two Chinese societies -- one free and democratic, the other under the grip of a brutal totalitarian dictatorship. Totalitarian China has not only been ravaged by the virus but has also spread the contagion to our shores. Free China has defeated it. The lesson is clear: COVID-19 grew in the cesspool of Chinese Communist tyranny. The antidote to the coronavirus is freedom. (Source.)

Technically, the display by White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson the previous day had been, after a screaming home run to left at Guaranteed Rate Field, much more of a bat throw. Anderson was hit by a pitch from Royals starter Brad Keller in his next at-bat. Benches cleared. Expletives were hurled. Halfhearted shoves were, well, shoved. Suspensions would come for Anderson and Keller, but none of the above has a single thing to do with this story.

That same morning, Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito woke up with a sore left hamstring. He had started that game for the Sox and exited it in the third inning after suffering a mild strain that would keep him out of action for two scheduled turns on the bump.

“It wasn’t worrisome in the long term,” Giolito, 25, recalled in a phone interview from his home in Davis, California. “But it was a huge annoyance. I wanted to be in the rotation.”

The experience heightened Giolito’s awareness of what he had been doing with his plant leg when pitching. In his return May 2 with an up-and-down five innings — and a no-decision — against the Red Sox, he was softer on the left leg, bending his knee a bit more in a smoother delivery that would become a permanent part of his mechanics.

It was perhaps the final piece of his 2019 puzzle. Giolito had worked tirelessly to improve on a 2018 season in which, in 32 starts, he had the highest WHIP (1.48) in baseball and the most walks (90) and earned runs allowed (118) in the American League. He had overhauled his mechanics and dived into neurofeedback training to combat the anxiety he had felt on the mound.

He was ready to flip the script on his young big-league career, and that’s exactly what happened. Giolito busted through last season with a 14-9 record, a 3.41 ERA and a 1.06 WHIP in 29 starts. His walks plummeted to 57, and his strikeouts exploded from 125 the season before to 228. He made his first All-Star team and finished sixth in AL Cy Young Award voting.

It all started after that hammy strain. The first start was followed by eight more — all victories for Giolito — during which he threw 57⅓ innings, striking out 65 and walking only 14, with a sparkling 0.94 ERA. He entered the stretch 2-1 with a 5.30 ERA and exited it 10-1 with a 2.22 ERA. For a while there, he was the talk of the AL.

GIOLITO HAD EVERYTHING WORKING in a complete-game shutout of the Astros on May 23 in Houston. Well, “everything” might be a bit of an overstatement. His fastball and changeup were on point, as they would be throughout the nine-game winning streak. He mixed in a few successful curveballs, too, an all-too-rare occurrence. One of the curves retired Josh Reddick swinging in the sixth inning, a perfect pitch that came out of Giolito’s hand on the same plane as his fastball. The pitch didn’t have a big hump but dived straight down, nasty and unhittable.

Even better in that game was Giolito’s slider, another pitch he used on a limited basis last season because he couldn’t control it consistently. Over pancakes at home in Davis, the 2020 season on hold, Giolito watched as the Sox streamed his 107-pitch gem on YouTube. It was his first time seeing the game broadcast-style.

“Yes! That’s the slider!” he thought more than once.

The way it came out of his hand and the shape it took looked better than it had in any other game last season. Giolito was able to remember the feel he had for his slider that day, something he had lost in ensuing starts when he tried — too hard, he realizes now — to throw it.

“I want to put guys away with the curve and fool guys with sliders,” he said. “What sucks is that I was working on those things [this] spring, and it was going really well. I was feeling like, ‘I’m going to be better than I was last year.’ That’s annoying.”

The work hasn’t stopped completely. Giolito has a large net in his backyard that he pitches into, though the space he has to work with — only about 65 feet — limits what else he can do. To simulate long toss, he walks with his 2½-year-old rescue mutt to a park two blocks from home, ties Louie (“my best buddy”) to a tree, positions himself about 15 feet from the chain-link shell behind home plate of a softball field, crow-hops and fires into the back side of the shell.

One would think a 6-6 All-Star doing this in plain view at a park in a residential neighborhood would be a big draw — or at least create a curious ruckus.

“People just walk by,” he said. “They’re walking dogs, kids are skateboarding by, scootering by. Every once in a while, a kid will seem pretty curious. But I don’t think anybody knows who I am.”

WALKING THE STREETS near his and wife Ariana’s residence in downtown Chicago, Giolito got recognized a bit more often as his breakout 2019 season went on. Outside of that? Nah.

“I don’t think it’s quite there on a national level,” he said. “The White Sox haven’t won for a very long time. Obviously, Chicago is a large market, but it’s still a Cubs town.

“When they put out top-pitchers lists, things like that, on social media, a lot of times I’m not there. That’s OK. It is what it is. I had one good year. I feel like last year was just the tip of the iceberg, scratching the surface. I want to be better. That’s why it sucks that we’re not playing.”

These days, Giolito is feeding his jones for competition by participating in an online “MLB The Show 20” charity tournament that features one player from each of the 30 major-league teams. For each player, it’s a 29-game round robin — one three-inning game against each of the other participants — before a postseason that will culminate in a “World Series” on May 2 that no doubt will, ahem, captivate the masses.

Hey, that’s what’s happening.

A day before his first four games (he would beat the Marlins’ Ryne Stanek and the Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette and lose to the Braves’ Luke Jackson and the Mets’ Jeff McNeil), Giolito was looking forward to having some fun with it. In particular, he was happy for the chance to interact with fans. Part of his prep for the tournament was a marathon session — four hours — playing “The Show” while livestreaming on his personal Twitch channel.

“At one point, I had, like, 200 people watching,” he said. “That’s not a huge number, but you’ve got to grow your channel. It’s good practice — talking, reading, trying to game. You’re multitasking, but you can’t just sit there and be boring. Nobody wants to watch that.’’

Practice for what? Maybe a broadcasting career down the line. Giolito — who would be superb at it — has an “um” and “you know” habit he would like to break.

It certainly isn’t practice for pitching in 2020. A year ago at this time, he was shut down for two starts. This time, it’s painfully longer.

He hopes it won’t be too much longer.

“Man, I hope so,” he said. “It’s so hard not to be playing baseball.”",real

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that if a ""big peak"" of coronavirus floods hospitals this winter, ""we have the potential here to go through days we have not seen since World War II. ... As a nation, we will not be ready.""

“What we’re experiencing is a massive global destabilization of all our systems,” adds Brian David Johnson, a futurist and director of the Threatcasting Lab at Arizona State University. “We actually don’t know all the damage that has happened. We’re on life support, globally.”

If the world premiere of COVID-19 caught you off guard, you may need to get prepared for a sequel.

Many scientists believe the pandemic likely will dissipate over the summer only to return late this year in a second wave that could be worse than the first. While that outlook is no certainty – just one of several plotted by public health experts – disaster planning is all about anticipating worst-case scenarios.

So, with months to go before a possible Round 2, is the United States prepared – medically, economically and emotionally?

The leading answer from epidemiologists, economists and futurists: probably not. But tomorrow depends in part on what we do as individuals, communities and a nation.

The destabilization described by Johnson is glaringly evident in three realms:

Medicine. Some U.S. hospitals, hit with patient surges in COVID-19 hot spots, warned of running out of ventilators, personal protective equipment and other supplies. The Strategic National Stockpile was nearly emptied. Thanks to a global manufacturing binge, supplies appear to be catching up and, in key locations such as New York City, the disease is abating for now. But, if the coronavirus returns with a second wave, will the health care system be ready?

The economy. Unemployment is higher than any time since the 1930s. Businesses – from mom-and-pop shops to major corporations – are going under. Global trade is crippled. Travel, sports and entertainment industries are mostly dormant. How much more financial trauma can the economy endure?

Emotional damage. Psychological, social and political strains of the coronavirus, though not easily measured, are palpable products of a medical and economic nightmare. If the pandemic gets worse down the road, threatening our fabric of work, schools, homes and governance, will Americans be ready?

Preparedness is not easily defined. In biblical lore, Egypt endured 10 plagues – water turning to blood, swarms of locusts, even an infestation of frogs – and it’s still around.

But, if COVID-19 has delivered any lesson, it may be the value of looking ahead at a nation's ability to absorb catastrophic shock.

‘This is not the time to do nothing’:Volunteers risk lives to deliver food to the needy

Hoping for a miracle

On the health care front, it’s crucial to recognize that COVID-19 is, as University of Michigan epidemiologist Arnold Monto puts it, “a very strange virus.”

Its origin, transmission, symptoms and damage remain puzzles. And its future seems to defy computer modeling. Because of that, experts start any conversation by warning that the first wave is still cresting and that predicting the future of the coronavirus is a fool’s game.

“If you don’t express doubt about what’s going to happen, you really haven’t done your job,” noted Monto, who has consulted for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. “My take is you have to keep an open mind and prepare for all eventualities.”

Monto and others point out that COVID-19’s threat could be blunted by the development of a vaccine or a treatment.

But many epidemiologists share the view of Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who testified during a congressional hearing Tuesday: “The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far.”

Amid coronavirus: AP exams went online and had tech problems. College Board says it's investigating.

In the absence of a panacea, public health experts say, comprehensive testing is the immediate solution. It would allow disease tracking and quarantines to significantly dull a second COVID-19 spike. Most argue that testing and tracing is the most important step in controlling the disease. But they also contend those efforts have been a bust in the United States so far.

“We still haven’t gotten our act together,” said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “I think it’s inevitable that we’re going to have a second, if not a third, wave” because of the nation’s “erratic and disorganized policies.”

“The biggest single failure was the lack of testing in this country,” agreed Eric Toner, senior scholar with Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security. “That influenced every single other thing that has gone wrong. … And we still have problems in testing.”

Until the disease can be monitored and controlled, Toner warned, “we need to be really careful about dialing back social distancing. It has been amazingly successful – more effective than I thought it would be.”

Monto's big fear is a resurgence of COVID-19 coinciding with a deadly flu outbreak, overwhelming hospitals, health care workers and supply systems. “If they’re all synchronized, it may really break down,” he said. “To me, that’s the worst-case scenario.

I don’t think we’re ready now.""

Medical supplies: The great unknown

Without a vaccine or treatment, and with testing problematic, hospital preparedness looms crucial.

But questions about medical supplies lead to a dead end. It's not clear how many ventilators or personal protection outfits would be needed, how many are now in stock, or how many may be produced by a ramped-up manufacturing system during the coming months.

In mid-April, Toner estimated supply demands in the United States for a 100-day surge of COVID-19: 4 billion gloves, 321 million gowns and 179 million medical-grade masks. But those numbers are no longer valid, he said, and the actual need is unclear.

Even if an accurate count was available, there is no national inventory showing the volume of supplies on hand.

Nor is there a calculation of worldwide manufacturing increases amid the crisis, which could meet the demand.

In a National Action Plan for medical preparedness issued this month, Toner and other researchers at Johns Hopkins portray the U.S. health care system almost like an intensive care patient who is bleeding out – desperately needing an infusion of money to restock supplies and reinforce staffing.

While a federal bailout bill provides $175 billion to cover losses, the report says, that's not nearly enough.

While the price is high, authors concluded, “it will certainly cost less than the trillions now being spent spend because our public health and health care system was not prepared or equipped for this pandemic.”

Economy: Recovery or ruin?

In a recent op-ed for The New York Times, Romer and fellow economist Alan Garber wrote about the dueling threat coronavirus poses to America's public health and financial well-being. While shutdowns may allow some people to survive, they concluded, “it is our economy that will be dead.”

In an interview, Romer said that whether COVID-19 stays on its present course or ebbs and surges, the nation faces an unemployment rate of 30%, yet people seem to think it will just go away allowing life to resume as before.

""There's this optimistic bias, and a certain amount of denial,"" he said. ""With no change in policy, they're just not going back to those jobs … and there's a good chance those jobs won't be there.""

Unless or until a vaccine is developed, Romer said, the only hope is a biweekly testing requirement for everyone, with those who have the disease going into isolation.

An alternative would be to choose the economy over safety. But Romer said that raises a tragic question: ""Are we willing to accept 2,000 deaths a day for months on end?""

“The longer it goes on, the more it’s going to imply we’re just not coming back to the same place,” agreed Ken Rogoff, economics professor at Harvard and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.

While declining to give the nation a letter grade for preparedness, Rogoff said COVID-19 has undermined much of the planet's economic structure. As one example, he said, “we’re going to see just a collapse of global trade. We may have a world where (nations) … become more like fortresses.”

Rogoff praised the “drastic measures” taken thus far in the United States to fight the pandemic, including huge relief allocations. But such tactics cannot be sustained, he said, and leaders in Washington, D.C., seem unequipped for prolonged viral waves. “The problem is, where is the economy heading?” Rogoff said. “Are they mentally prepared for that? I doubt it. … It’s not going to be easy, because the political system is really fragile.”

Colin F. Camerer, a professor of behavioral finance and economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said COVID-19 may require intense, short-term pain to achieve a long-term gain. He and others pointed to South Korea as a model nation that used comprehensive testing and strict social distancing to weather the economic storm while limiting infections. By contrast, Italy and the United States – which were slow to test or take precautions – have suffered heavy casualties and economic damage.

“The No. 1 thing is to get the first wave over, and then prepare for the second one,” Camerer said.

Surviving a psychic trauma

Almost everything about American life has changed: jobs, schools, homes, churches, entertainment.

Psychiatric journals are churning out articles on suicide and mental health problems triggered by fear, financial ruin and social isolation. An already polarized political system seems utterly askew, with dueling versions of reality. And the internet's output of conspiracy theories, lies and apocalyptic visions has gone on steroids.

Johnson, the futurist at Arizona State University, said it’s not yet clear how we’re handling the first go-round of coronavirus, let alone additional waves. But upheaval is coming.

After the 9/11 attacks, Johnson noted, there were changes – from sweeping anti-terror legislation to relatively small things, like footwear: ""We’ve normalized taking off our shoes at the airport.”

While Johnson prefers to focus on human resiliency, he acknowledged doomsday visions are part of the profession. With COVID-19, he said, ""there are ways of looking at this destabilization where it does not restablize.""

Thomas Frey, a futurist and founder of the DaVinci Institute in Colorado, said the pandemic may be “the most explosive crisis in all of world history” – a potential paradigm shift not just economically but culturally.

Fundamental gestures, such as the handshake, are likely to vanish or change.

Yet Frey also questioned whether worldwide “hysteria” over the disease is rational, and he suggested that shutting down a country may be overreactive unless the death toll borders on 1 million.

“It’s a bizarre balancing act we’re trying to maneuver,” he said. “I think our emotional preparedness – societal preparedness – I’d give that a failing grade. I actually don’t see us having the political will do go through this again.”

Nancy Berlinger, a research scholar with The Hastings Center, a non-partisan bioethics institute in New York, said it’s clear America is not ready for a second viral peak “because we were not prepared for the first.”

Berlinger, who lives in one of the world's hardest-hit communities, speaks with evangelical passion about displaying virtues during catastrophe times: Compassion. Open-mindedness. Unselfishness.

While the pandemic has created wrenching dilemmas for leaders, she said, daily personal decisions such as social distancing also fall within the ethical prism, and selfishness may empower a pandemic to take more lives, cause more suffering.

“It’s about the moral choices each and every one of us make,” Berlinger said. “I hope we will in every way possible have a stronger sense of who our neighbor is, who our fellow citizen is.”

“People say that’s a very distinct possibility,” Trump said when asked a possible second wave while in Michigan. “It’s standard. And, we’re going put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country.”

Trump’s comments came as he was touring a Ford Motor Co. plant outside of Detroit that has converted its automobile manufacturing facility into one making ventilators. During a speech at the plant, the president praised Ford workers for their efforts to produce thousands of ventilators during the pandemic.

“The global pandemic proves once and for all that for America to be a strong nation, America needs to be a manufacturing nation,” Trump said. “I’m fighting to bring back our jobs from China and many other countries.”

Conservative radio host Buck Sexton said Trump had told this to him during a White House interview Wednesday, saying, “We will not do a lockdown for the second wave that is likely to come in the winter.”

During his speech, the president also lashed out at China for its role in the coronavirus pandemic.

“It came in from China and it should have been stopped in China,” he said.

The first reports of the contagion surfaced late last year in Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province, and the disease quickly spread across the globe. As of Thursday, over 5 million people have been infected worldwide with over 329,000 deaths, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. – READ MORE

Tia Davis experienced breathing problems after contracting the coronavirus. Tia Davis/Facebook

I started getting short of breath. So definitely does attack your respiratory system and it hits it hard. So I think like, that was one of the worst symptoms, because I woke up in the middle of the night and I was disoriented. I wasn't able to breathe.

I wasn't able to get anybody's attention. And I think at that point you started sitting down and having a conversation with yourself. Like, OK, this is it for me. This is it for me and my children. I won't ever see them again-type of thing. But I thank God that he was with me. Was able to wake him up, wake my husband up to let them know that something wasn't right.

When I first got here, they wasn't going to test me because I didn't fit the criteria. After some CAT scans and a couple of tests, they decided to go ahead and test me. And they came back and they told me that I tested positive.

My family is on 14-day quarantine. I haven't seen my children, haven't seen my husband in days now.

There is no treatment for coronavirus. So what they're treating is, they can treat a symptom. So if I have a fever, they could treat it with Tylenol. If I have a cough, they could treat you with cough medicine. But my body has to fight it off. So I have to take the time to rest, make sure that I'm trying to keep down as much food as I can and let my body do its job.

I've been here, I think I lost about 15 pounds, so I don't know what I'll be looking like when I get up out of here. I got to get my hair done y'all. Talk about my bonnet.

Everybody's making jokes about it. I don't take it personal. I think the only thing that kind of bothered me was to see myself on the news, to see my local news station speak of this situation but not even know wholeheartedly like what was going on.

It's a lot scarier when you see it on the TV or when you read about it than what it actually is. But I'm not going to sit up here and pretend like it's a joke. Definitely has taken me away from my family, gave me some breathing problems, and sat me down for a while to reevaluate myself and kind of, you know, my life. I know after this, you know, I want to get out and do more.

So just make sure that you guys are keeping your kids safe and you're keeping yourself safe as well. That's the best advice that I can give anybody. Just make sure to y'all are paying attention to your body. Your body will let you know when something's wrong, and if it's telling you something is wrong, then go ahead and get tested.

Carl Goldman was one of more than 700 passengers and crew aboard the Diamond Princess cruise who tested positive for the coronavirus. Claire Molloy/Business Insider Today I had a very high fever. I also had started to pick up a dry cough. Those are the only two signs of anything coronavirus.

Unlike other colds and the flu that I had, there was no headache, no sneezing, no sniffles, no sore throat, no body aches, and even with that high fever, no chills and sweats that usually get that hot and cold.

Biocontainment was weird. I spent 10 days in there. I was hooked up to all kinds of monitors.

Anyone entering my biocontainment, it was like Neil Armstrong landing on the moon. They had full biocontainment suits on, three layers of gloves, a motor in their back to provide air, duct tape all around, sealing off anything that could possibly expose themselves.

But there was nothing they could give me other than ibuprofen and gallons and gallons of Gatorade. I kid that I had been through every flavor of the rainbow of Gatorade multiple amounts of times. The light blue is the bomb. Stay away from the grape. That's nasty.

We were out there, there was a lot of hate that came at us. There were some very elaborate death threats that mounted and got worse as the days progressed, as people learned that the State Department was going to allow us back to the States.

All along we were making lemonade out of lemons, looking at the glass half full, not half empty, living for the present, not worrying about the past, and also not focusing on the future because all of that was out of our control.

Stress is the biggest, biggest contributor to battling the immune system, and it's not good for the immune system. So keeping our stress level down was important.

I'm quite baffled as to why people are interested at all. I'm just this guy that's got a positive diagnosis with no symptoms stuck at home. But I guess people are fearful, and I'm sad about that. I think I'm proof that even if you catch the virus, you can be just fine.

It feels quite surreal to be part of this huge thing, actually. I step back, and realize that I see it on the news and it just dominates the headlines everywhere.

I am restricted to, obviously, inside the home. I'm not to be within 6 feet of my wife, and if we're in the same room, they want us wearing masks. I can't have any visitors. We can't sleep in the same bedroom or use the same bathrooms. So I'm in the basement, she's upstairs.",real
137,1275,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/coronavirus-richard-burr-stocks-trade-fbi-investigation.html,2020-05-18,Coronavirus: what Sen. Richard Burr allegedly did with his stocks.,"North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr leaves the Capitol on Thursday. Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images

The allegations against Sen. Richard Burr, who until last week was chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, go something like this: While he was telling his constituents that the U.S. response to this novel coronavirus was under control, he was actually selling more than a million dollars’ worth of stock. This was back in February, when most Americans were still going to work or riding trains and buses. Burr is under suspicion for insider trading because around the time he cashed out that stock, he was saying remarkably different things about the coronavirus in public and in private: He co-wrote an op-ed for Fox News saying that the Trump administration’s coronavirus response was going smoothly, but a few weeks later, privately speaking to donors and lobbyists, he warned that the coronavirus threat was serious.

Tim Mak, NPR’s Washington investigative correspondent, was one of the first reporters on this story. On Monday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Mak about the secret audio recording he unearthed that helped launch this investigation—and how much trouble Burr is really in.

Mary Harris: What are the challenges of investigating a senator like this? I imagine proving insider trading here would be difficult. As chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the briefings Burr got about the coronavirus may have been confidential. So it’s hard to know what did he know, who can know what he knew, and how that might have changed his mind about where to move his money.

“Burr never warned the public of his view on this, despite his expertise on biological threats.” — Tim Mak

Tim Mak: That’s true. But there are ways for investigators to get around that issue. For example, his communications with his family and broker are not classified. They can be obtained by investigators.

I don’t think there was an expectation that this would balloon in this way. There was no telling at the beginning of this that it would become what is essentially a criminal investigation.

Part of the reason Burr’s stock sales seem suspicious is the context in which we learned about them. You uncovered this audio of him from Feb. 27. Where’s it from? What’s happening?

In order to understand that audio, we have to put ourselves back in the mindset of what the world was like in February, this pre–coronavirus crisis era: The stock market had not crashed. We hadn’t done all these stay-at-home orders. The first person had not died in the U.S. from the virus. But on Feb. 27, Burr went to a luncheon with a group of well-connected constituents. These are business leaders in North Carolina who have lobbying firms representing them in D.C. At the luncheon, Burr says he’s worried that the coronavirus crisis will possibly become as bad as the 1918 flu pandemic.

At the time, I don’t think people were making that comparison as much.

He seemed to really have dug into this question of what the coronavirus crisis would mean for America. And he seemed to have some sort of information about how bad it would be. He warned about schools shutting down. He warned about travel being shut down. He warned that military hospitals would need to be set up in order to create beds and provide treatment to people who were sick.

All of these things, before most of the public had any inkling that this would happen. Burr never warned the public of his view on this, despite his expertise on biological threats. He never decided to put out a press release, go to a television camera, go to any of the reporters’ mics. He warned this private group of individuals, and that was pretty much it.

And a few weeks earlier, he’d co-written an op-ed for Fox News in which he basically said, You’re in great hands, the Trump administration is going to handle this coronavirus well. Then as soon as you reported that private meeting, other information started to come out about Burr’s stock trades.

There’s this legislation called the STOCK Act. It requires lawmakers to periodically disclose their stock transactions. ProPublica went through Burr’s stock transactions and realized something that I hadn’t, which is that Burr, on Feb. 13, made 33 stock transactions and sold up to $1.7 million worth of stock in a single day. And that’s just a few days after that op-ed.

How big a deal is $1.7 million worth of stock for someone like Burr?

For a senator and for someone of his age, his net worth is not particularly high compared with that of his colleagues. So this would represent a substantial portion of his assets. Remember, he has said that he’s not going to run for reelection when his term ends in 2022. So he’s presumably thinking about retirement, and he makes a move here, it appears, to secure his future.

At NPR, you teamed up with Dartmouth College to analyze Burr’s transactions. You looked at Burr’s stock sales on Feb. 13 to see how they compared with trades he’d made in the past.

Between 2012 to about 2019, Burr is a very bad stock picker. On average, if you look at his stocks six months after he purchases them, they’re down about 0.8 percent relative to other stocks in the same industry. And after a year, they’re typically down about 6 percent compared with that same benchmark.

He is kind of lousy about stock picks. He doesn’t trade in high frequencies. In a quarter he would probably make an average of 3.2 stock sales. But on Feb. 13, he made more than 30 stock sales. On a single day he does 10 times what he would normally do in a quarter. And not only that, these stock sales are amazing: incredibly well-timed, incredibly well-chosen. After they were sold, they underperformed the market by 8 percent. That means those stocks performed worse than comparable ones in that same sector between the sale and the end of March.

You wrote to the senator’s spokesperson to comment on these stocks and she wrote back, “lol.”

That’s correct. That happened. I can’t speculate why she would do that.

How does the senator defend himself and explain the stock sales?

The defense for an allegation of insider trading is to say, I didn’t use nonpublic information, I only relied on public information, information that you or I or anyone else would have. So his argument is that he made these very well-timed, precise, successful sales based only on CNBC reporting on the coronavirus.

We should say that this opened up interest in other lawmakers and how they were dealing with their own stocks. But it seems like Burr’s case is different. I wonder if you can articulate why.

There are a number of reasons why his transactions are more suspicious than those of some of the other names we’ve heard, like Sens. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and Dianne Feinstein of California. He had this enormous number of transactions in a single day. And that volume of transactions was very unusual for him. He sold a lot of stocks, up to $250,000 worth, in the hospitality sector, which, as we know, has really been hit by the coronavirus crisis. His private comments show that his personal view contradicted his public view, and his statement in response to some of this reporting showed that he personally directed the sales. Loeffler, for example, has said that she used a third party and didn’t personally direct any of her sales. So if you look at the totality of those circumstances, you realize Burr’s are far more suspicious than the others.

Burr is no longer the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee for the time being. Can you talk about the significance of that?

Burr has been a mainstay. If you talk to Democrats on the committee, you’ll find that many of them have a lot of respect for Burr and that he’s worked in a generally bipartisan way when it comes to matters of intelligence. In fact, since the 2016 election and the fallout in 2017, he’s been working across the aisle on a series of reports on Russian interference in the 2016 election and afterward. As chairman, Burr has not been super public or particularly accessible to the press. But I think, generally speaking, a lot of folks have praise for the work he’s done.

I was surprised to see this investigation move forward against a Republican senator. I’m curious if you can tease out the decision-making here, because there has been speculation about why it’s been Burr, since he was among the more bipartisan senators and was looking into Russian interference in the election. I wonder if you think that speculation is fair.

I think the answer to the question really depends on whether you think the Justice Department maintains its independence in the William Barr era: if the attorney general is working as the attorney general of the United States or as the president’s attorney general. If you think the DOJ has become hopelessly politicized, then you might have a fair question to raise about whether Burr was targeted here. You look at the history: Those close to the Trump White House are not fans of Burr because, as part of the Russia investigation, he helped approve a subpoena of Donald Trump Jr. to bring him before the committee. That was a surprising move by Burr that angered a lot of folks in the Trump orbit. Now, if you think the DOJ maintains a level of independence, you can look at the evidence and see that there’s a fair amount to suggest wrongdoing and to investigate.

I wonder if you can talk a bit about how news organizations handled the story, because it looked different if you went over to Fox News instead of NPR.

I don’t think you can understate the influence of Fox News commentary on prime time. What was remarkable to me was how quickly Tucker Carlson turned on Burr and targeted him regarding these trades. It kind of set the tone for the conservative response to this scandal—no one was lining up to defend Burr at any point. In fact, Carlson explicitly asked for Burr to resign, a remarkable demand from a Fox News host to a sitting Republican senator. That was a very important moment that I think set the tone for how folks on the right would respond to this.

I guess Burr’s defense could be, The insider information I was getting as the intel chair wasn’t that the hotel industry is going to tank—and yet he sold a lot of hospitality stock.

You don’t need to have specific information that says Marriott is going to go down. It just needs to be material and nonpublic, meaning that if you or I as a stock buyer or seller were to have that information, it would be meaningful. So if he’d received—for example, I’m not saying that he did—a briefing that outlined the number of deaths or cases of the coronavirus that were to come to America, that would have been nonpublic information. And if he’d made transactions based on that information, there is a real possibility he could be charged with insider trading.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The last time bassist Jon Jones played a concert with his country group Eli Young Band was March 8. He hopes to hit the stage again in June to launch a new drive-in concert series in his first return to live music with fans since the devastating coronavirus.

“This is going to be a surreal kind of setting,” Jones said of plans to play acoustically to 400 cars full of people at the new Texas Rangers stadium in Arlington, Texas.

As states start to let businesses reopen under limitations, music industry organizers are testing out new models of smaller, socially distant concerts. Jones is cautiously optimistic that drive-in concerts might help crack open a door for musicians that slammed shut so quickly in March.

“We’re going to be one of those last industries, those last segments that opens up, unfortunately,” Jones said. “I do hope that everybody is cautious and opens up appropriately and slowly.”

George Couri, of artist management company Triple 8 Management, teamed up with the Rangers to put on the four-night concert series called Concert in Your Car starting June 4. The interest was so high that tickets sold out quickly and additional shows were added. In all 3,200 tickets have been sold.

“It’s about creating an experience for live music again,” said Couri. “The big driver for me is to prove it can work. It would give people hope that this can be repeated again and again in many different places.”

But the path ahead for live concerts hasn’t been easy. A venue in Arkansas initially had to postpone an indoor concert that would have defied the state’s ban on large gatherings after health officials ordered the show shut down. The concert featuring singer Travis McCready went on Monday night.

Drive-in concerts aren’t new, but in the wake of the pandemic, the idea hit in Europe and now the United States. Country star Keith Urban played a drive-in theater in Tennessee last week with scaled back production and crew, but he said that he thinks the concert industry in the near future will pivot to a drive-in style, but with larger capacity.

“The stage is going to be coming out to the parking lot and people will be staying in their cars,” said Urban. “It will be an endless tailgate party.”

In Florida, DJ D-Nice, who has been entertaining people online with his popular DJ sets on Instagram called #ClubQuarantine, played music for first-responders in their cars on Saturday. Concert promoter and venue operator Live Nation is planning to test fanless concerts, drive-in concerts and “reduced capacity shows” both indoors and outdoors, according to President and CEO Michael Rapino, who spoke about the ideas on an investor call.

Tailgate Fest in California already proved the car-centered concert was a viable option before the pandemic. The country music festival where fans are encouraged to watch from their RVs, trucks or cars is going into its third year this August.

Melissa Carbone, the CEO of Tailgate Fest, said there are a lot of changes coming to the festival this year because of the coronavirus, including removing a general admission pit area and a VIP pool party, and they are expecting attendance to drop from last year’s high of 25,000. But the lineup of Dierks Bentley, Lynyrd Skynyrd and TLC hasn’t changed as of yet.

“We’re ahead of the curve on it and nobody wants to see live music go away,” said Carbone.

The World Health Organization has guidance and risk assessments for mass gatherings during the COVID-19 outbreak, said Lucia Mullen, an analyst at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and part of the WHO’s expert cell for mass gatherings and COVID-19.

For concerts, Mullen said recommendations included moving events outdoors, limiting attendance, spacing people out, taking temperatures of participants and staff, hand sanitizing stations and extra cleaning. But she said organizers should also look at the aftereffects of holding a mass gathering in an outbreak, such as contract tracing.

“Do they know who is going there so they can follow up with them if they do find out there is a case and alert all of the participants so they can go get themselves checked out?” asked Mullen.

In a rapidly changing outbreak, Mullen said event organizers should rely heavily on the advice of local health officials in their areas.

“Mere weeks can change an epidemiological context in a city,” she said.

For most bands, touring is a large majority of their income, well above what they get for releasing albums. But Couri said this initial launch of drive-in concerts at the Texas stadium won’t be a huge money-making endeavor early on.

They are charging $40 for each car, and all tickets have to be purchased in advance, not on-site. No concessions or merchandise will be available for sale to reduce contact between people. All bands will play acoustically so there’s minimal production crew needed. There won’t even be outdoor speakers because the music will be transmitted by radio.

Jones said for him and the members of Eli Young Band, they aren’t doing the drive-in concerts solely to make up lost income, but instead to give music back to the fans.

“I think people need something safe that they can go do and if we can be that, that’s awesome,” said Jones.",real
142,1765,https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/after-lockdown-global-coronavirus-vaccination-program,2020-05-22,After the Lockdown: A Global Coronavirus Vaccination Program,"

Originally published on www.globalresearch.ca

The COV-19 vaccineis now front page news. Yet the first tests were conducted in mid-March and there was virtually no coverage. The following article by Prof. Michel Chossudovsky

was first published by Global Research on March 17, 2020, following the first tests of a vaccine conducted by Moderna Inc. with human volunteers in Seattle on March 16.

***

The tendency is towards a Worldwide lockdown spearheaded by fear and media disinformation. Currently, hundreds of millions of people Worldwide are under lockdown.

What is the next step in the evolution of the COV-19 Crisis?

The lead entity for the novel coronavirus vaccine initiative is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) an organization sponsored and financed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Note the chronology: The development of the 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) a week prior to the official launching by the WHO of a Worldwide Public Health Emergency (January 30) at a time when the number of ""confirmed cases"" Worldwide (outside China) was 150 (including 6 in the US).

The pandemic was launched by the WHO on March 11. And five days later, barely covered by the media, the first tests involving human volunteers were conducted in Seattle on March 16.

CEPI is seeking a ""monopoly"" role in the vaccination business the objective of which is a ""global vaccine project"", in partnership with a large number of ""candidates"". It announced funding for its existing partnership with Inovio and The University of Queensland (Australia). In addition, CEPI confirmed (January 23) its contract with Moderna, Inc. and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been instrumental in waging the fear and panic campaign across America: ""Ten Times Worse than Seasonal Flu"".

According to a report of the WHO pertaining to China's epidemic (which has currently been resolved):

The most commonly reported symptoms [of COVID-19] included fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, and most patients (80%) experienced mild illness. Approximately 14% experienced severe disease and 5% were critically ill. Early reports suggest that illness severity is associated with age (>60 years old) and co-morbid disease. (largely basing on WHO's assessment of COVID-19 in China)

Screenshot The Hill, March 19, 2020

The Central Role of CEPI

CEPI is dealing simultaneously with several pharmaceutical companies. The Moderna- NIAID in all likelihood is slated to implement the COV-19 vaccine in the US.

On January 31st, the day following the WHO's official launching of the global public health emergency and Trump's decision to curtail air travel with China, CEPI announced its partnership with CureVac AG, a German-based biopharmaceutical company. A few days later, in early February, CEPI ""announced that major vaccine manufacturer GSK would allow its proprietary adjuvants-- compounds that boost the effectiveness of vaccines -- to be used in the response"". (The pandemic was officially launched on March 11)

There are many ""potential vaccines in the pipeline"" with ""dozens of research groups around the world racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19"".

In turn the EU and the US are currently competing for the vaccine markets on behalf of powerful pharmaceutical conglomerates, with the European Commission ""offering up to €80 million in financial support to the CureVac AG"" after it was reported that Trump ""was attempting to secure exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing"", under the auspices of NIAID headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The October 2019 Coronavirus Event 201 Simulation Exercise

The coronavirus was initially named 2019-nCoV by CEPI and the WHO: exactly the same name as that adopted in the WEF-Gates-John Hopkins Event 201 pertaining to a coronavirus simulation exercise held in Baltimore in mid October 2019.

The Event 201 John Hopkins simulation addressed the development of an effective vaccine in response to millions of cases (in the October 2019 simulation) of the 2019 nCoV. The simulation announced a scenario in which the entire population of the planet would be affected. ""During the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases [in the simulation] increases exponentially, doubling every week. And as the cases and deaths accumulate, the economic and societal consequences become increasingly severe.""

The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.

The COV-19 Global Vaccination Program

CEPI (on behalf of Gates-WEF, which funded the simulation exercise) is currently playing a key role in a large scale (global?) vaccination program in partnership with biotech companies, Big Pharma, government agencies as well as university laboratories.

The foregoing statement by CEPI was made nearly two months prior to the official declaration of a pandemic on March 11.

""We're having conversations with a broad array of potential partners"". And critical to those conversations is: What's the plan to make very large quantities of vaccine within a time frame that is potentially relevant to what people seem to be increasingly certain will be a pandemic, if it isn't already there? …"" [Richard Hatchett, CEPI CEO in interview with stat.news.com].

The underlying focus is to develop a global vaccine.

And part of that was doing a global survey of manufacturing capacity to think about where we wanted to plant the manufacturing of any successful products we were able to bring forward.

Of significance, Hackett confirmed that the project to develop a vaccine commenced not only prior to the discovery and identification of the coronavirus (January 2020) but several months prior to the October 2019 simulation exercise.

""We did that in the last year or so. We are using the information that we have collected and have that team now thinking about opportunities for scaling vaccines of various different types. That is a work in progress. For some of the technologies the tech transfer [to a manufacturer] may be something that could be done in a time frame that was pertinent to the epidemic, potentially.

I think it is going to be really important to engage those folks who have access to really substantial production capacity. And having the big producers at the table -- because of their depth, because of their experience, because of their internal resources -- would be very, very important.

The candidate vaccines will be very, very quick. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID [who has been spreading panic on network TV], is out in public as saying he thinks the clinical trial for the Moderna vaccine may be as early as the spring. (emphasis added)

What is unfolding in real life is in some regards similar to the October 2019 simulation exercise at John Hopkins. The scenario is how to produce millions of vaccine shots on the presumption that the pandemic will spread.

The CEPI sponsored vaccine conglomerates had already planned their investments well in advance of the global Worldwide health emergency (January 20th).

I [Hackett] think part of the general strategy is to have a large number of candidates. [and] you want to have enough candidates that at least some of them are moving rapidly through the process.

And then for each candidate, you need to ask yourself the question: How do you produce that? … [And] how are you going to get to that point with production at a scale that is meaningful in the context of a disease that is going to infect the whole of society? (Interview conducted by Helen Branswell, statsnews, February 3, 2020)

Moderna Inc

Moderna Inc based in Seattle is one of several candidates involved and supported by CEPI.

Moderna announced on February 24th the development of ""an experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273″. ""The initial batch of the vaccine has already been shipped to U.S. government researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)"" headed by Dr. Antony Fauci.

While Moderna Inc initially stated that the first clinical trials would commence in late April, tests involving human volunteers started in mid-March in Seattle: (bear in mind the pandemic was officially launched on March 11).

Researchers in Seattle gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday -- leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges.

Some of the study's carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.

""We don't know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That's why we're doing a trial,"" Jackson stressed. ""It's not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population."" (FOX news local)

CEPI's nCoV-2019 Global Vaccine and the ID2020 Digital Identity Platform

While CEPI announced the launching of a global vaccine at the Davos World Economic Forum, another important and related endeavor was underway. It's called the ID2020 Agenda, which, according to Peter Koenig constitutes ""an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity"".

""The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity"". (Peter Koenig, March 2020)

The Founding Partners of ID2020 are Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) among others.

It is worth noting the timeline: The ID2020 Alliance held their Summit in New York, entitled ""Rising to the Good ID Challenge"", on September 19,2020, exactly one month prior to nCov-2019 simulation exercise entitled Event 201 at John Hopkins in Baltimore.

Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what the WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out' the multiple devastating programs of ID2020? (Peter Koenig, March 2020)

ID2020 is part of a ""World Governance"" project which, if applied, would roll out the contours of what some analysts have described as a Global Police State encompassing through vaccination the personal details of several billion people Worldwide.

In the Wake of the Lockdown

The fear campaign will continue in the wake of the lockdown. Will the hardships of the economic and social crisis encourage people to get vaccinated?

To implement the Global Vaccine, the propaganda campaign must continue. The Truth must be suppressed. These are their ""guidelines"", which must be confronted and challenged.

The main actors including CEPI will require the firm endorsement of the WHO (which they control), a green light from the scientific community as well bold statements by corrupt politicians.

Moreover, they will have to suppress information and analysis on the features of the virus, how it can easily be cured (without a vaccine), which is currently the object of debate by virologists and physicians in several countries including the US. In recent developments, hydroxychloroquine is being used to treat patients in both Europe and North America. Big Pharma is intent upon suppressing evidence on how COVID-19 can be cured. The media is complicit. It is not informing the public.

Remember the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic when Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology compared the H1N1 pandemic to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic while reassuring the public that the latter was more deadly. (CBC: Get swine flu vaccine ready: U.S. advisers)

Based on incomplete and scanty data, the WHO Director General predicted with authority that: ""as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years -- nearly one-third of the world population."" (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).

It was a multibillion bonanza for Big Pharma supported by the WHO's Director-General Margaret Chan.

In a subsequent statement she confirmed that:

""Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario"", Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), quoted by Reuters, 21 July 2009).

""Swine flu could strike up to 40 percent of Americans over the next two years and as many as several hundred thousand could die if a vaccine campaign and other measures aren't successful."" (Official Statement of Obama Administration, Associated Press, 24 July 2009).

There was no pandemic affecting 2 billion people… Millions of doses of swine flu vaccine had been ordered by national governments from Big Pharma. Millions of vaccine doses were subsequently destroyed: a financial bonanza for Big Pharma, an expenditure crisis for national governments.

There was no investigation into who was behind this multibillion fraud. Several critics said that the H1N1 Pandemic was ""Fake""

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), a human rights watchdog, is publicly investigating the WHO's motives in declaring a pandemic. Indeed, the chairman of its influential health committee, epidemiologist Wolfgang Wodarg, has declared that the ""false pandemic"" is ""one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century."" (Michael Fomento, Forbes, February 10, 2010)

Video: ""The House Cat Flu"" is Coming. The Meow Apocalypse…

Michael Fomento concludes:

Even within the agency, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Epidemiology in Munster, Germany, Dr. Ulrich Kiel, has essentially labeled the pandemic a hoax. ""We are witnessing a gigantic misallocation of resources [$18 billion so far] in terms of public health,"" he said.

They're right. This wasn't merely overcautiousness or simple misjudgment. The pandemic declaration and all the Klaxon-ringing since reflect sheer dishonesty motivated not by medical concerns but political ones.

Unquestionably, swine flu has proved to be vastly milder than ordinary seasonal flu. It kills at a third to a tenth the rate, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. Data from other countries like France and Japan indicate it's far tamer than that.

COVID-19 is Déjà Vu. Lets not be taken in again.

We are currently in a Lockdown, We have time to reflect. There are important lessons to be learnt from the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic is far more serious and diabolical than the 2009 H1N1. The COV-19 pandemic has provided a pretext and a justification for destabilizing the economies of entire countries, impoverishing large sectors of the World population. Unprecedented in modern history.

And it is important that we act cohesively and in solidarity with those who are victims of this crisis. People's lives are in a freefall and their purchasing power has been destroyed. What kind of twisted social structure awaits us in the wake of the lockdown?

Can we trust the World Health Organization (WHO) and the powerful economic interest groups behind it. The answer is obvious.

Can we trust the main actors behind the multibillion dollar global vaccination project?

Can we trust the Western media which has led the fear campaign? Disinformation sustains the lies and fabrications. Can we trust our ""corrupt"" governments? Our national economy has been devastated.

This is an act of ""economic warfare"" against humanity.",fake
145,1909,https://theduran.com/freedom-of-worship-under-attack-by-liberals-caught-on-video/,2020-05-23,"Freedom of worship under attack by liberals, caught on [Video]","When I was growing up in the US during the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, one of the prized freedoms we often and repeatedly talked about was the right to pray to God as one understands God, to be free both to go to the church of your church and to be free from going to the national church by requirement. Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.

Until now.

The coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.

However, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:

“Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

Instead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:

The burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church’s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church’s right to free speech and interfered with its members’ ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, “Bet you stay home now you hypokrits,” spray-painted on the ground near the church’s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff’s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an “A” in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.

One thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.

But it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.

This video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.

On Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:

Thank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I’m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It’s not right. So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.

President Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed “best and brightest” have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and “Experts” are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Illinois election officials are crediting mail-in balloting and early voting with keeping the numbers up.

In Illinois, 28.36% of registered voters cast ballots in the March 17 primary, which is the third-lowest turnout for a presidential primary over the past 40 years, according to the official canvas released Friday.

But while the voter turnout was relatively low, it was comparable to recent presidential primaries.

Four of the previous six presidential primaries saw turnouts of less than 30 percent. And this year’s turnout topped the 2012 presidential primary, which had a 23.2% turnout and 2000’s nominating contest, which had 25.91%.

This year, 2,279,439 of the state’s 8,036,534 registered voters cast ballots in the March primary.

What saved voter turnout from bottoming out during the coronavirus pandemic for this year’s primary were options that allowed voters to avoid the precincts on Election Day, said Matt Dietrich, a spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections.

“It looks like we did have some offset from people who voted early and voted by mail,” Dietrich said.

Early numbers show vote-by-mail ballots increased from the previous primary election — 10% of total ballots cast this year, compared to 3% in the 2016 primary, according to the board’s unofficial numbers.

Early voting was also up, Dietrich said, with about 636,000 people opting to vote early, compared to 520,000 in 2016, according to unofficial numbers.

The statewide turnout was also boosted by Chicago, where election officials have already released figures showing a city turnout of 37.78% — also crediting early and mail-in voting with boosting the final numbers.

The statewide canvas released Friday included the final results for contests up and down the ballot.

Among the Democratic presidential contenders, former Vice President Joe Biden ran away with the primary, winning 58.94% of the vote, compared to the nearest contender, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who nabbed 36.18%.

In the contentious 3rd Congressional District Democratic primary, challenger Marie Newman won 47.26% of the vote, beating incumbent eight-term Rep. Dan Lipinski, who won 44.72%.",real

The initiative provides an additional way for fans to directly support acts on SoundCloud as live concerts and festivals are indefinitely postponed in many portions of the world.

To add the button to your SoundCloud artist page, click “Edit,” and then “Add support link.” Pick your platform of choice, and then hit “Save changes” to generate the button, which appears above your stats and on your track pages. SoundCloud supports a variety of services, including Kickstarter, Bandcamp, Paypal, and Patreon, and will not take a cut of any donations made through the platform.

Artists keep 100 percent of donations made through their page

Additionally, SoundCloud separately announced a new marketing and distribution platform called Repost by SoundCloud. The result of an acquisition SoundCloud made last year, Repost by SoundCloud includes a number of tools for independent artists to get their music into the world and plan out their marketing.

Through Repost by SoundCloud, artists can distribute music to platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, TikTok, and Instagram, set up pre-save campaigns, claim content on YouTube, and pitch tracks for playlists. It also opens up access to SoundCloud-specific features like track background art and banner click-throughs.

The service is available to those 18 years or older and is included with SoundCloud’s Pro Unlimited subscription tier. It can also be purchased for $30 a year. In both cases, you keep 100 percent of your SoundCloud royalties and 80 percent of the revenue received from other services.

While Repost by SoundCloud is a permanent feature, it’s not apparent how long the direct donation button will stick around. SoundCloud’s announcement says it will be active “as long as we’re all in this,” suggesting that it’s a temporary initiative because of the crisis.

Recently, SoundCloud partnered with Twitch in another relief effort to help fast-track musicians to affiliate status in order to unlock Twitch’s monetization tools.",real

In March crazed Democrat Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer prohibited big box retailers from in-person sale of seeds because according to her, plant seeds were non-essential.

Whitmer also called on Home Depot and Lowes to close off certain sections like flooring, garden centers and plant nurseries.

The tyrannical governor of Michigan also barred grocery stores and brick-and-mortar retailers from selling vegetable seeds because she could.

In late March Michigan Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer limited access of doctors from prescribing the lifesaving drugs hydroxychloroquine and Z-Paks to save senior citizens in the state from Coronavirus. Then she continued to send coronavirus patients to nursing homes. This is still happening in May!

And in her latest unexplainable move the far left governor banned motorboats and jet skis but canoes and sailboats were acceptable.

This woman is a crackpot.

On Friday an employee at a dock in northern Michigan shared an interesting story about a phone call with Gretchen Whitmer’s husband.

This was just days after Whitmer finally lifted her nonsensical ban on motorboating.

Via 100% Fed Up:

Yesterday, an employee of North Shore Dock, in northern MI, a company that provides boat and dock services in northern Michigan, including the Birch Lake area, shared an interesting story about a phone call the North Shore Dock company received, allegedly from Governor Whitmer’s husband, Dr. Mark Mallory. So today put a smile on my face, as most of your know we install docks, store boats etc. This morning I was out working when the office called me, there was a gentleman on hold who wanted his boat in the water before the weekend. Being memorial weekend and the fact that we started working 3 weeks late means there is no chance this is going to happen. Well, our office personnel had explained this to the man and he replied: “I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?” The employee (his name has been blacked out to protect his privacy) continued: As you can imagine, that does make a difference, that would put you at the back of the line!!! Needless to say, our Governor and her husband will not be getting their boat for memorial day. He added: Too good not to share, I love it when karma comes around, even in small doses. To summarize, the Michigan’s Democrat governor has placed the entire state of Michigan under lockdown for several weeks. On the same day that she announced she would be reopening businesses in certain areas of northern Michigan, which includes the area where her vacation home is located, her husband’s vehicle is seen parked in their driveway. Two days later, when businesses that have been shut down for months are allowed to reopen, Governor Whitmer’s husband calls North Shore Dock company and asks to take cuts in front of common Michiganders, because he’s the husband of the woman who shut down their business in the first place. North Shore Dock, LLC put out a statement on Facebook a few hours ago, confirming that Governor Whitmer’s husband did call their business and ask to have his boat put in the water. According to the North Shore Dock Facebook post, he was told he would not be given preferential treatment and that he would have to wait in line like everyone else, adding, “ALL of our customers are valued, and we cannot place you in front of others who scheduled earlier.”

Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal say the program operates “with little to no transparency.”

Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who ran for president, tweeted on April 27: “Project Air Bridge is Jared Kushner’s secretive public-private partnership for COVID-19 supplies – but it’s failing. States can’t get equipment & nobody’s explaining how the project works. @SenBlumenthal & I want answers from the participating suppliers.”

That same day, Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, tweeted: “Trump seems to be playing politics again with public health — misdistributing scarce medical supplies. @SenWarren & I demand transparency on Project Air Bridge & how it works.”

Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a White House senior adviser, is identified in a variety of news reports as the central player in launching Project Air Bridge in March. A key feature is using companies, including Medline, to distribute the medical supplies nationwide.

The senators are pressing Medline for a list of all supplies delivered via Project Air Bridge and all recipients, whether state or local governments, hospitals or medical systems or other clients.

Medline Industries CEO Charlie Mills was at the White House on March 29 for a meeting of coronavirus supply chain distributors with President Donald Trump. The firm is among the nation’s largest privately-held health care manufacturers and distributors.

The firm — once in the news for its ethylene oxide environmental issues at its Waukegan sterilization facility — is making masks, gloves and sanitizers in Lake County. The Waukegan facility is now reopened and with new emissions control equipment is sterilizing the high- grade N95 masks in short supply.

On April 27, Warren and Blumenthal sent a letter to Mills, asking about “your company’s interactions” with the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Federal Emergency Management Agency “and other executive branch entities distributing medical supplies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.”

The letter also stated that “the American people need an explanation for how these supplies are obtained, priced, and distributed through Project Air Bridge. Unfortunately, neither the administration nor your company has explained critical details, such as the content of any existing contracts or financial agreements.”

“Between reports of shortages across the country, seizures of supplies by the government, and outrageous prices, there is an extraordinary level of confusion and dismay about the current state of the medical supply chain.”

The senators told the executives the administration is “stonewalling” about Project Air Bridge and requested supply chain information the companies are in a position to know.

The senators wanted replies by Friday. Medline spokesman Jesse Greenberg told the Chicago Sun-Times on Friday, “I decline to respond at this time.”

Similar letters were sent to executives of five other Project Air Bridge companies: Cardinal Health; Concordance Healthcare Solutions; Henry Schein; McKesson; and Owens and Minor.

As of May 4, Project Air Bridge completed 112 international flights, with another 23 ready to go, according to the Department of Homeland Security. O’Hare Airport is among the destinations.

No shipments included goods intended for distribution by the state of Illinois. “We have not received anything directly from Project Air Bridge,” Jordan Abudayyeh, a spokesman for Gov. J.B. Pritzker, told the Sun-Times.

Pritzker has been in the spotlight for airlifting urgently needed supplies from overseas suppliers in cloak-and-dagger operations to avoid having items headed for the state end up sidetracked to federal supply chains.

The Trump White House frequently brags about the amount of desperately needed medical supplies from Asia that are flown into the U.S. instead of coming by ship, which is slower.

Warren and Blumenthal are concerned about how the goods are distributed, the financial relationships with the companies involved and the potential for profiteering.

The federal government pays for the supplies — masks, face shields, gowns, gloves — as well as the air freight.

According to FEMA, Medline and the other Project Air Bridge companies are required to make a priority of selling 50% of the supplies to clients in “hot spots” with the firms free to sell the rest through their “traditional channels.”

The senators in their letter asked how Medline was “selected as a participant in Project Air Bridge” as well as information about contracts or agreements.

The letter also asks what costs Medline pays “for the federal government’s transport of these items, and how does it compare to your typical costs for obtaining items from suppliers” and “how has your company distributed medical supplies” and personal protection equipment.",real

During its unveiling by House Democrats earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the bill a ""big laundry list of pet priorities"" that has ""no chance of becoming law.""

The House passed a second $3 trillion bill aimed at providing relief and support to those impacted by the coronavirus pandemic on Friday.

The bill, known as the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, follows the first coronavirus bailout signed into law in late March with bipartisan support, the CARES Act.

The rescue package was approved with a vote of 208 to 199, but it is unlikely to pass in the GOP-controlled Senate.

As we know from previous reporting:

** Dr. Tony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx used the Imperial College Model to persuade President Trump to lock down the ENTIRE US ECONOMY.

** The fraudulent model predicted 2.2 million American deaths from the coronavirus pandemic

** The authors of the Imperial College Model shared their findings with the White House Coronavirus task force in early March

** Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx then met with President Trump privately and urged him to shut down the US and destroy the record Trump economy based on this model

** New analysis of the Imperial College Model finds the study is “completely unusable for scientific purposes” — The Imperial College study was a complete sham

** Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx pushed a garbage model on the White House and the American public and destroyed the US economy

As reported weeks ago — in mid April Dr. Fauci admitted that it was he and Dr. Birx who persuaded President Trump to lock down the US economy knowing the massive destruction this would cause in jobs, lives and commerce.

After Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci sat with the president the US went into lockdown and since that time over 39 MILLION Americans have lost their jobs and thousands of companies have gone bankrupt.

In late March, Neil Ferguson, who was behind the Imperial College coronavirus study, backtracked and said 20,000 Brits may die from the coronavirus instead of his original estimates of 500,000.

Neil Ferguson resigned from his government post as researcher a week ago after he was caught breaking his own lockdown rules by meeting with his married mistress at his home.

196,1246,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/17/coronavirus-social-security-2030-261207,2020-05-17,Coronavirus could push Social Security to insolvency before 2030,"The conservative Heritage Foundation last year panned the bill for “broadening Social Security’s size and scope, raising taxes on all workers, and leaving them with less money to meet their daily needs.”

“This is a very politically problematic situation and Congress, by its very nature, doesn't like dealing with politically problematic situations,” Womack said. “You’re going to have to take a vote to do something to save these programs and it’s going to be very unpopular with a lot of people. It’s probably going to be career-ending for some people.“

But with tens of millions of people out of work, Larson and others think the outbreak could spark a newfound appreciation for Social Security, both as a reliable monthly payment and an economic stabilizer.

“I think it will come out of this pandemic looking really good and that people will value it a lot,” said Alicia Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

The pressure to find a long-term funding fix will be compounded by the fact that the program serves the population most vulnerable to the virus — older adults, particularly minorities and low-income individuals, Larson noted.

If Democrats win the White House and control a majority of Congress, there could be momentum around proposals to increase benefits, impose the payroll tax on higher-income taxpayers and institute a wealth tax in order to generate more revenue, Auerbach said.

Trump has vowed not to cut Social Security, but Republicans have sought in the past to curb federal spending on the program.

The president is now pushing a payroll tax cut in the next round of pandemic relief, which both Republicans and Democrats worry would harm the social safety net and do little for the tens of millions of people who aren’t collecting a paycheck.

The Trump administration has also considered — and rejected — a plan penned by two conservative scholars that would allow Americans to receive checks of up to $5,000 in exchange for a delay of their Social Security benefits, The Washington Post reported.

White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said in a statement that “the mere thought of this so-called ‘plan‘ is ludicrous on its face — as President Trump has been clear that while he is in office, the American people can feel secure without a shadow of a doubt that he will completely protect Social Security and Medicare — end of story, full stop.“

Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on earnings of up to $137,700, with the tax split evenly by employees and their employers. About 40 years ago, Congress set the taxable earnings cap to cover about 90 percent of all wages, with increases annually to reflect average wage growth. But in 2017, the cap only covered 83 percent of earnings, thanks to rising wage inequality and growing health care costs.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has said he would levy the 12.4 percent tax on wages above $400,000 in order to push the program toward solvency.

Even with swift action once the pandemic ends, reforms could take years to implement, Auerbach noted. The federal government’s general fund might have to prop up Social Security’s trust funds at some point, he said.

“Congress won’t be able to come up with any politically palatable changes that produce enough revenue or enough reductions in benefits soon enough to make the system viable over the long-term,” Auerbach said. “So they may need extra money.""

Public health officials usually recommend that people without air conditioning head to places like malls and libraries where they can cool off, but that’s not an option for a lot of people sheltering at home.

The problem could soon begin to affect India

The problem could soon begin to affect India, where temperatures begin to climb in April and have reached as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). India’s 1.3 billion residents have been ordered to stay indoors until April 14th to stop the spread of disease, and only about 5 percent of the population has air conditioning.

Heat-related illness can begin with mild symptoms like a headache and muscle cramps, and they can progress to confusion, dizziness, vomiting, and losing consciousness. Once the body reaches a point where it can no longer cool itself down by sweating, heat stroke can lead to organ failure and eventually death. Those most at risk are often the poor and elderly, groups that are similarly hard-hit by the novel coronavirus. Heat-related deaths can be prevented by checking in on people who might be isolated indoors and providing public places for them to get out and cool down. But those strategies contradict efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, which mostly focus on keeping people apart.

“We’re in between a rock and a hard place if it were to become a heatwave during the time when we’re enacting physical distancing measures,” says David Eisenman, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles’ department of community health sciences.

“We’re in between a rock and a hard place”

In developing countries, the migration to cities from rural areas has posed new problems when it comes to preventing deaths from heat. Traditionally built homes in less densely packed areas often included designs that naturally kept the structure cool, like inner courtyards and windows aligned to allow prevailing winds to pass through. But poorer newcomers to cities have packed into informal settlements where homes may be little more than brick or metal walls with a corrugated metal roof. “That’s literally an oven,” says Kurt Shickman, executive director of the Global Cool Cities Alliance, which partners with governments to plan more heat-resilient cities. It’s estimated that 40 percent of the world’s urban expansion takes place in slums, and more than two-thirds of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations Development Programme.

“The problem is way worse in the developing world, but we shouldn’t take that and say that we’re out of the woods here [in the US],” Shickman says. The US sees upward of 600 heat-related deaths each year. Heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and more intense because of climate change, took a heavy toll in Europe last year, too, killing almost 1,500 in France last June and July.

“[Extreme heat] is even more of a pressing issue with the pandemic than it was beforehand, and this need for staying at home is only bringing out issues that already existed,” says Sonal Jessel, a policy and advocacy coordinator for the Harlem-based nonprofit WE ACT for Environmental Justice. Even though New York City has just stepped into spring, Jessel is already scrambling to figure out strategies to keep people safe in case hotter temperatures arrive earlier this year.

Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities

Temperatures can be several degrees hotter in cities like New York compared to surrounding areas, because all the asphalt and concrete absorb and trap heat. It can be even hotter in industrial neighborhoods with fewer trees and parks, which means some communities are more vulnerable than others. Almost half of all people who lost their lives to heat in New York City between 2000 and 2012 were African American, although they’re just under 25 percent of the city’s population.

“Now that we’re all instructed globally not to gather in close proximity, it’s going to really call for creativity and quick pivoting among public health systems around the world,” says Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist at the National Resources Defense Council, who has worked with Jessel’s organization in New York and other groups in India to prevent heat-related illness and death. She and other public health experts are beginning to put their heads together to figure out how they may need to tackle two crises — coming heat waves and the ongoing pandemic — in tandem. But they don’t have answers just yet.

Cities might have to figure out how to create publicly accessible places where people can cool down while also maintaining enough physical space between each other to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Eisenman at UCLA says. “It just seems like a really hard thing to pull off,” he says.

More needs to be done to help people cool down at home

If beating the heat by going to a public place is out of the question, then more needs to be done to help people cool down at home, says Jessel. That means getting air conditioners into more homes, and helping people pay their utility bills so that they don’t need to choose between running their air conditioning and paying for other necessities. With lots of people losing their jobs during the pandemic, making air conditioning affordable is even more pressing. Jessel’s organization is advocating for more funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that provides assistance with home energy bills. Beyond that, Jessel and other advocates are pushing for ways to retrofit homes to keep them cooler. Installing better insulation, painting roofs white to reflect the sun, and planting rooftop gardens can keep homes and buildings cool.

Temperatures in parts of California, where there’s a state-wide shelter-in-place order, are going to rise above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) next week. While Eisenman doesn’t think those numbers will begin to pose a threat just yet, he warns that the first really hot days of the season can be particularly dangerous because people are still adjusting to the change in temperatures. And while California and New York are current hotspots for COVID-19 in the US, he worries that other states with fewer coronavirus cases now but hotter climates, like Arizona, might see their number of cases peak closer to the start of summer. That potential scenario could be deadly, which is why Eisenman and others are encouraging groups to take early measures to address the combination of threats — before the case counts and temperatures start to rise.",real

On today's episode of Loud & Clear, Brian Becker is joined by John Ross, Senior Fellow at Chongyang Institute, Renmin University of China, and an award-winning resident columnist with several Chinese media organizations.

China’s biggest political gathering of the year is finally taking place after a two-month delay because of the coronavirus pandemic. Called “Two Sessions,” the first meeting was yesterday and was a gathering of top political leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. Today’s meeting is of the National People’s Congress. Premier Li Keqiang will lay out the country’s economic goals and the policies needed to achieve them. And the U.S. government is lashing out at a new proposed Hong Kong security law.

Unemployment in the United States is likely in the 25 percent range with some 40 million Americans having filed for unemployment benefits in the past month. In real terms, it’s almost certainly higher, perhaps significantly, as many people have dropped out of the labor market or their benefits have run out. Like the US, the UK has struggled with its response to the coronavirus. But the official UK unemployment rate is less than four percent. That’s ridiculous, of course. Unofficial figures put it at around 20 percent. As Mark Twain once said, there are three kinds of lies: Lies, damn lies, and statistics. Is that what we’re seeing in the UK? John speaks with Neil Clark, a journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared in The Guardian, The Week, and Morning Star.

It’s Friday! So it’s time for the week’s worst and most misleading headlines. John speaks with Steve Patt, an independent journalist whose critiques of the mainstream media have been a feature of his site Left I on the News and on twitter @leftiblog.

Friday is Loud & Clear’s weekly hour-long segment The Week in Review, about the week in politics, policy, and international affairs. Today they focus on the chaotic and deadly push to reopen the country’s economy, the 2020 election, exploding unemployment, a developing housing crisis, and more.

In April 1945, the family of four-year-old Uwe Trostel expected only cruelty from Soviet soldiers. However, the first encounter turned out to be completely different. Based on his mother’s stories, Uwe Trostel, who is now 79, spoke about the peaceful coexistence that endured with the Russians in a Czech town until 9 May.

Uwe Trostel is the deputy chairman of the Berlin Club of Memories and Stories of Life and a former member of the GDR Planning Commission. Recently, he spoke to Sputnik with a passionate appeal for rethinking relations with Russia due to the crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Moreover, considering the experience of the GDR, he explained why former East Germans still sympathise with Russia.

'The Russians Are Coming!'

End of April 1945, Hanichen, near Reichenberg, Czech Republic. The weather was chilly and generally horrible. Often, my mother and I spent days with my grandparents. In 1938, my parents built a new house, and we moved into it the same year. Some of our relatives lived on the top floor; a Czech midwife, Mrs Berek, lived under the roof.

Staying with my grandparents saved heating and there was always something to eat, although not enough, so that hunger was our constant companion. German soldiers were constantly coming from the east, looting in search of something to eat and something to wear to finally get rid of their uniforms. My mother gave them some old clothes of my father, who had gone to war, and from whom we hadn't heard since 1943. Every time a crowd of hungry, ragged, and freezing soldiers appeared in the city, there was a glimmer of hope that one of them was my father. But hope always disappeared as quickly as it sprouted.

Mother first asked where those soldiers came from, hoping to learn something about my father, but always in vain. Even worse, the soldiers advised her to flee to the Reich, as far west as possible, as quickly as possible, because it might only be a few weeks, if not days, before the Russians would arrive.

And then, they said, the worst that could possibly happen would happen: they would randomly kill Germans, rape women, loot and burn houses.

The soldiers almost panicked when talking about the horrors to be expected from the Russians, always advising my mother to ""flee"" to the west as soon as possible. But we had no relatives or acquaintances in Germany who could shelter us.

The days passed at the same pace: visiting my grandparents, watching German soldiers queuing in front of Tuschinsky's butcher shop when it was open, which was rarely the case anyway due to the lack of deliveries.

One day, my mother was, as usual, watching the soldiers, looking for my father among them. Suddenly she cried quietly: ""The Russians are coming!"" A few minutes later she cried out again: ""They're occupying our house!"" The house was built in 1938, not yet plastered, and was close to the forest from which the Russians came.

To the Russians, our house seemed suitable as accommodation. In the large fenced garden, they could set up tents, park their horses and equipment, and position two horse-drawn cannons. In the house itself, three officers occupied two rooms: the commander took the living room, and the two others occupied my parents' bedroom.

In the evening, we had to decide what to do next: spending the night at my grandparents' was tight and uncomfortable. With a mixture of despair, defiance, and fear, my mother took my hand and, despite my resistance, dragged me to the house. At the entrance were two Red Army soldiers, armed with rifles, ready to fire as we were approaching.

My mother said in a rather pitiful voice that this was our house and we wanted to get in. The soldiers, of course, didn't understand anything, but since mother, seeing they weren't showing aggression, insisted for us to be let in, they finally called the commander. He came, and rather rudely, but in good German, asked what we wanted. My mother explained that that was our house and we wanted to get home. The officer thought for a while and said that we would get a room. The whole house and the garden were confiscated for an indefinite period. We would have to follow all orders to avoid severe punishment.

My mother and I slept restlessly. The next morning, we watched the bustle of Russians through the window. They fed their horses and a terrible-looking – but tethered – dog, took coal from our basement, and wood from the nearby forest, as well as did many other things. It was clear that they were setting up for a long time. The officers moved the furniture, the soldiers set up three or four tents in the garden, which could accommodate 20 or 25 people.

Before lunch, the soldiers brought a field kitchen, made a fire, brought water, and started cooking something, stirring the water and adding some ingredients – we couldn’t see what it was. After a while – the stove had already been heated up, smoke was pouring out of the chimney, the water was boiling, and the smell of food spread everywhere – a line of soldiers equipped with bowls and spoons started lining up in front of it.

Meanwhile, my mother spread margarine over a small piece of bread, which we, of course, immediately ate. The smell of food from the field kitchen made our hunger unbearable. Almost fainting, we looked at the line of soldiers becoming longer and longer. My mother was desperate and finally gave me a plate and sent me to the end of the line.

The soldiers’ reaction was quite unexpected. It could be expected that they would send an additional eater away, but it turned out to be different: the last soldier in line laughed, took me in his arms, and put me on the shoulders of the one standing in front of him; and so I went on, accompanied by the laughter and hooting of the soldiers until I found myself by the stove.

The soup wasn't quite ready, so I had to wait. The soldiers were saying something to me, but I didn’t understand a word of Russian. As a result, I was saved by the cook, who took my bowl, filled it with fragrant soup, and said: ""enjoy your meal"" in Russian. I quickly ran to my mother, who was smiling, and we enjoyed the delicious Russian soup and were finally really full again for a very long time.

However, we ""sinned"": our grandmother was with us, but we completely forgot about her. My mother waited until the cook had filled the last soldier's bowl, and rather boldly approached him, pointing to the kettle and saying: ""babushka, babushka…"" The cook understood, scraped out the leftover food from the cauldron, and filled another bowl. So my grandmother ate well again for a long time.

The Russians stayed, and there was no sign that they were going to fight further. At the same time, there were rumours that they had already reached Berlin and that the war would soon be over. Every day we got our portion of lunch – not very much, but it was very tasty.

Mother suddenly started saying that the war might not last very long, and then at least we would have something to eat. Five or six days after the Russians had arrived, my mother noticed that all the dishes, linens, towels, etc. had disappeared. Apparently, the Russians stole everything. She cried and ran to the commander to complain. He was not friendly, but said that she should make a list of the missing things. With shaky hands, she wrote down the amount of cutlery, sheets, towels, etc., and gave the list to the officer. He grabbed the gun, went out into the courtyard where the soldiers’ tents were set up, pointed the gun at one of them, and shouted something (of course, we didn't understand anything).

Suddenly, towels, cups, forks, spoons, and other things flew out of the tent. The officer did the same ""trick"" with other tents. He told my mother to collect everything, check if everything was in place, and inform him. Mother, still trembling, counted everything, realised that everything was in place, and ran to the officer to thank him

It was then that the officer first started telling us something about his own life.

According to him, before the war, he was the director of a conservatory in Odessa; he played the piano and performed at concerts (this information is most likely not very reliable. Perhaps he was some kind of assistant professor). He was looking forward to the end of the war. Also, for the first time (neither we nor the neighbours had a radio), he told us that the war would end in a few days. He said that Soviet troops were already close to Hitler’s bunker and would probably capture it in the next few days.

Two or three days later, on 8 May, an indescribable cheer suddenly started among the Russians. They were crying: ""Hooray! Hooray!"" and something else that we did not understand. Among them was the commander; he had a box with bottles, which he triumphantly handed out to the soldiers.

When he saw my mother, he gave her a bottle and ordered to drink for the Soviet victory over Hitler's fascism.

He suddenly had several beer glasses in his hand that were filled with vodka. My mother had to drink one, but after the first sip, she vomited miserably, to the hooting of the Russian soldiers.

The Russians were drinking until nightfall, singing some melancholy songs, and then fell asleep. But, oddly enough, in the morning they woke up, lined up at the orders of the officer, and he delivered a speech in front of them, from which we could only understand the word “fascism"". In addition, he awarded several soldiers with medals that he attached to their chests.

After the speech, the soldiers continued singing Russian songs – this time very melodic and much more melancholic than the day before, when they were drunk. Most of them had tears running down their cheeks, and suddenly my mother burst into tears too. And since I didn’t understand why they were crying, I burst into tears as well.

The officer, apparently trying to calm my mother, spoke to her. The meaning of his rather long monologue boiled down to the fact that he was trying to make her understand that Germany and all Germans, especially the children, had no prospects, so he decided to take me to Odessa. He said that there I would have the brilliant prospects that the Soviet state could offer.

My mother was terribly afraid, fell to his knees in front of him, and burst into tears, even more, begging him to have mercy and not take a child from its mother, even a German. Then his face became stern, and he said that the Germans had taken much more from him; but since she was so heartless that she was ready to leave her child to starve, not knowing what would happen next, he agreed to respect her will. My mother felt relieved, she hugged him and wished him and his family all the best.

Suddenly the Russians started hurrying – everyone wanted to get home as soon as possible. They started loading their wagons, harnessed two horses, attached a cannon to them, and set off singing. In a hurry, they left some stuff, and these items came in handy for us in the following days and weeks.

And they left their huge shaggy dog. While they were here, no one dared to approach the dog – it barked and bared its teeth so that everyone was afraid. But having realised that it had been left alone, the dog suddenly became harmless, like a lamb.

It crawled towards us, licked my mother’s hands, and looked completely different from before. However, this didn’t save it: the butcher’s wife, Mrs Tuschinsky, lured it to their place, and over the next few days we could eat meat again. This is not to say that it was very tasty, but at least we had food…",fake

The large-scale public gesture is an homage to Mayor Lightfoot’s rallying cry earlier this month promoting her “Chicago Together! Make a Mask, Give a Mask, Wear a Mask” initiative. The mayor is asking residents to make/donate homemade cloth masks for first responders and Chicago’s homeless/shelter populations. A cloth-masked Lightfoot herself is pictured on the video screens at the Crown Fountain in Millennium Park.

In Daley Plaza, the equally iconic Picasso statue is also sporting a mask. The massive coverings for the lions and the Picasso feature a Chicago flag and were created by Dimension Design in Glenview.

According to a statement from the Art Institute, the materials used in the creation of the masks did not in any way impact those needed to produce PPE supplies for first responders and frontline workers.

The masks, made from a printable synthetic material, were designed by Kelly Winter of Dimension Design, and took several days from plan to completion, said the company’s co-founder Jeremy Biewer. A team of 10 employees worked on the project — from graphic design, to fabric engineering, to printing, cutting and sewing.

“The fabric can hold up pretty well in Chicago weather,” Biewer said. But if there’s any [wear and tear] in the coming weeks, he said they can “produce replacements in a matter of hours if necessary.”

Biewer said his company generally works trade shows and large-scale events, but has reconfigured to create masks for first responders and frontline workers during the pandemic. To date, they’ve donated 3,000 masks to local facilities.

The lion masks were made for a “very modest three-figure charge for material and labor,” said Jim Winter, executive vice-president of Dimension Design, while the mask adorning the Picasso statue was “donation from the company to the city and people of Chicago.”",real

Since the pandemic took hold in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has relaxed fuel economy standards — a decision that will lead to more emissions from tailpipes. It also weakened a rule meant to keep mercury pollution in check, which could make it harder to regulate other toxins, too. And in direct response to the coronavirus pandemic unfolding, the EPA announced in March that it “does not expect” to penalize polluters for a broad range of violations related to routine monitoring and reporting requirements.

“No shame. I don’t know how else to put it.”

“They just seem to have no, I don’t know — no shame. I don’t know how else to put it,” says former EPA administrator during the Obama administration, Gina McCarthy, who now heads the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

The Verge spoke with McCarthy about what impact the coronavirus crisis is having on people and our environment now and into the future.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

What effects do you see the COVID-19 crisis having on the environment?

One of the things that I think people now realize after COVID-19 is just how small the world is, how we can be so immediately devastated worldwide by a public health threat, and how important it is for us to think about that and its application to other worldwide concerns like climate change. Obviously, our reactions to COVID-19 have led to some significant behavioral changes and adaptations that we had to make. And some of those may continue to have an influence into the future. It just shows you that in a moment of crisis, the world can, people can change their behavior.

“This isn’t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced.”

But certainly, this isn’t the way you want to see pollution to be reduced. A path to a more sustainable future isn’t to react and adapt in these immediate ways that also diminish our ability to have a strong economy and keep people working.

There has been a lot of attention on how air quality has improved as a result of stay-at-home orders. What, if any, takeaways we can gather from that?

Number one is that people begin to see the impact human beings actually have on the environment. When you have a country like India where much of the population are seeing the Himalayas for the first time, that’s pretty shocking. When you’re seeing that kind of reduction, not just in air pollution but in water pollution, like looking at Venice and looking at the canals and they don’t look horrible anymore. The sediment isn’t churning, and they’re not black and brown. And so people are beginning to recognize that we do have an influence on the world in a way that could end up resulting in systemic change.

One of the biggest takeaways for me has been that people are wondering why African Americans are getting hit so much harder by COVID-19 in terms of the number of deaths that are happening compared to the percentage of the population. That’s not at all shocking to anybody who does public health work because it’s always been true that people of color in low-income communities are hit hardest because they always are facing the highest levels of pollution, the lowest levels of services like fresh food and health services. And so, if there’s anything that comes out of this that’s positive, maybe it’s an understanding that the world is unfair right now and climate change is going to make it continually inequitable.

If we look at who’s losing their lives to COVID-19 in larger numbers, it’s the same people that have been facing the air pollution that’s been impacting their lungs that may make them predisposed to being harmed by pollution. And that’s why it’s so unconscionable to me that this administration at this point in time is doing everything they can think of to make pollution standards weakened and to roll back their ability to be able to control pollution from industries that are operating even today. It’s just shocking to me because this just means it’s a callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind. It’s a callous acknowledgment that they care less about people who are in poverty and people who are of communities of color than they do the people that are trying to benefit through stimulus dollars — which is those who are already rich and are already powerful. It just shocks me that it could be so blatant.

“a callous disregard for the communities that have been left behind”

The decision the EPA made to relax its oversight of polluters during the pandemic shocked a lot of people who worry that it gives a break to powerful, polluting industries. What are your thoughts on what effect that decision might have on people?

The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy looks sort of reasonable on its face but has no limits. It basically says if COVID-19 is presenting any problem to you, then it gives you an excuse for not monitoring and reporting. And it specifically says that the EPA will not initiate penalties in those circumstances, and it doesn’t require the industries themselves to basically tell them in advance that they’re having problems so that the agency itself can monitor whether it’s legitimate or not. And most importantly, let the communities around them know that there may be opportunities to increase pollution that directly impact their ability to monitor their own health.

So, the very industries that have caused all of these predispositions for human beings who live in the shadows of these facilities to health consequences [and] to having greater impacts from COVID-19, these industries are the ones that could take advantage of this policy. They could be sending more pollution their way that makes them dramatically more unable to cope against the challenge of COVID-19. And so this is an unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight. And they did it with the full understanding that people wouldn’t be able to know what was happening or protect themselves.

“An unlimited get-out-of-jail-free card with no end in sight”

I read it, and I’ve never seen anything like it. Nobody has ever done any rule that provided this breadth of leeway to industries in the middle of a crisis that impacts lungs where people die if they don’t have clean air to breathe.

We’re also facing the economic fallout of the pandemic. What could a recession mean for environmental protection in the US?

What it would mean for an administration that has real integrity here and is doing its mission. It would mean that you put people back to work. You use the stimulus dollars as an opportunity to help those most in need. And then you hopefully look at, “So what does the future look like?” If I’m investing trillions of dollars, how do we do that in a way that builds a better future? So it ought to acknowledge that we have air pollution challenges that are keeping communities of color and low-income people at higher risk of all kinds of ailments, including COVID-19. They should put in place economic benefits to those communities so that they can address some of the income inequality we face. They should be looking forward and investing in clean energy jobs. They should be putting people to work in infrastructure that is necessary today for our water, for our sewer, for our adaptation challenges to climate change now.

There are so many ways in which they could look at this as building the next economy that doesn’t continue to rely on fossil fuels as the future. And instead, my fear is they’re going to do exactly the opposite. They’re going to use their “Back to the Future” strategy of investing in fossil fuels over people and polluters over people.

What lessons are we learning from how we responded to the coronavirus crisis that could be applied to how we take action on climate change?

“Nobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science.”

One of the things that it is teaching is the value of science. We have been struggling through this administration with attacks on science, and I don’t think they can continue. So there’s going to be a real demand for people to pay attention to facts, and for science, and to listen to experts.

Nobody wants to hear from politicians about their view of science as opposed to looking at experts. So maybe there’ll be a resurgence like there was 50 years ago with Earth Day, with people standing up and saying, “Okay, enough with this nonsense. Let’s look at real facts, look at science, let’s listen to experts, and let’s find a way forward.” I’m pretty confident that that shift will be enormously important. And people will start getting engaged again because they realize if they don’t, then they’re going to lose — then they’re going to have a democracy that doesn’t work. And if they get engaged, they’ll be able to make demands for a future they care about, one that protects their families and provides their kids with the kind of stability and opportunity that they deserve.",real

Many of them haven’t even hit the high point of their time in the game and are still on the ascent.

At 35, left back Jonathan Bornstein still has plenty left to give on the field, but his timeline is different than his colleagues’ and the end is closer than the beginning. And as COVID-19 eats away at the season, it’s taking away from the moments he has left in competitive soccer.

“I’ve thought about that, actually, quite a bit,” Bornstein said. “Obviously, the closer you get to the end of your career, you almost cherish every game, every practice a little bit more. Not being able to train with the team due to extenuating circumstances is a bit of a Debbie Downer kind of a thing, but at the same time I’m very thankful that my family and I are healthy and we’re here with the support of the team.”

That isn’t to say the end of Bornstein’s career is imminent. He certainly doesn’t think so, and the way his time in Chicago has started indicates he can still play at a high level.

After joining the Fire last summer, Bornstein solidified a spot that had given the team trouble and helped the back line finally mesh. Bornstein’s strong form carried over to the first two games of 2020, and he even scored in the Fire’s 1-1 draw March 7 at New England to help secure the team’s first point of the year.

As it turned out, that would be their last appearance for a long time. The pandemic halted the sports world the next week, and it’s unclear when and how the season will resume and when Bornstein will be reunited with his teammates.

Bornstein already is looking forward to that moment, whenever it arrives. But it won’t be the start of a farewell.

“Once we get started again, I’ll be even that much more anxious to be on the field and to be making the most of my time that I have left,” Bornstein said. “I try not to think too much about it because, to be honest, my goal is to play until I’m 40, so I’ve got another five years, if it all goes to plan. I try not to let the situation get me down as much as I can.”

The thing is, nobody knows when soccer will return. Bornstein is hoping it comes back sooner than later. He’d rather play in the summer than the end of 2020. But he doesn’t have control over the timeline.

He’s just trying to stay mentally and physically prepared for whatever comes his way.

“I think the uncertainty in any aspect of life is always what’s scary,” Bornstein said. “Doubt casts a shadow upon what could be, what couldn’t be, and at this point, we’re almost all living in the shadow of doubt.

But the virus is the same, whether it infects adult or child. The question is, why does COVID-19 affect them so differently? Both striking patterns in kids—the fact that most do not get very sick but a small number still end up with a delayed inflammation syndrome—may be rooted in a child’s still-developing immune system. And although COVID-19 is a new disease, these patterns are seen with other viruses too.

Immune systems change with age, becoming weaker or stronger in different ways. An adult’s body might be better armed against familiar threats, but more inflexible against novel ones. The two human viruses most closely related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 are the ones behind SARS and MERS—both also coronaviruses, a large family that infects many animal species. SARS likely jumped from bats to civet cats to humans in 2002, and MERS from camels to humans in 2012. Both have a much higher fatality rate than COVID-19 and neither exploded into a pandemic on the current scale, giving us smaller numbers from which to draw conclusions. Still, they too seemed to have largely spared children.

Like COVID-19, SARS and MERS were caused by viruses entirely new to humans, and adult immune systems are unused to dealing with entirely new viruses. By and large, the ones that sicken adults year after year are altered versions of viruses they’ve encountered before, such as seasonal flu. Children, on the other hand, are constantly dealing with viruses that are not necessarily novel but are novel to them. “Everything an infant sees, or a young child sees, is new,” says Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University. Thus, their immune system is primed to fight new pathogens in a number of ways.

Babies are born, for example, with a complete repertoire of immune cells called T cells. Every T cell has a unique receptor, and taken together, the pool of millions of T cells can recognize virtually any hypothetical pathogen. As the child begins encountering pathogens, though, their immune system winnows this diverse repertoire. It keeps the T cells involved in fighting off pathogens as a pre-stocked arsenal of “memory T cells,” should those pathogens appear again, but it begins losing the others. This is why adults are able to mount a rapid immune response to previously encountered pathogens, but also why they might have trouble fighting a new one. Diseases such as rubella and chicken pox are also, for various reasons, more severe in adults than in children. The pattern with seasonal flu is different, Farber says, but that may be because immunity against previous strains of the flu offer some crossover protection in adults.

The same may actually be true for coronaviruses, too, only in children. Another hypothesis for why most kids are spared is that they are frequently infected with the four coronaviruses that cause some common colds. These cold coronaviruses are not as closely related to COVID-19 as SARS or MERS, but they still share some similarities. Immunity against these cold coronaviruses wanes over time, so children who have been recently exposed might have some protection that adults don’t.",real

Even in Italy, where extended family relations run deep, Marzio Toniolo's tale of a coronavirus lockdown is unusual - four generations cooped up in one house.

They range in age from his three-year-old daughter Bianca to her great-grandfather Gino, 87. The experience tested bonds of love under the stress of cohabitation, and he believes they have passed the test.

The Toniolo family make a toast, clinking their glasses at home after cooking homemade ravioli. Toniolo, a 35-year-old elementary school teacher, his wife Chiara, 32, and their daughter, were staying in his grandparents' house in San Fiorano, a small town in northern Italy. They had moved from Milan, found jobs in local schools, and were waiting for their house in the town to be ready for moving in. Toniolo's father, Massimo, 62, was visiting from Sardinia.

A group of young people hang out listening to dance music on a boombox, by a train track. On Feb. 21, San Fiorano became part of the ""red zone"", a cluster of towns sealed off in what turned out to be a futile attempt to contain the virus.

Marzio takes a selfie as his daughter Bianca holds his face while they play “mother and baby” on a rainy day at home. ""The worst moment was when the first person in San Fiorano died. I know the son. I was already under a lot of stress,"" Toniolo said. ""That night, I almost had a panic attack and took a tranquiliser for the first time in years.""

On the fourteenth day of quarantine, Marzio’s grandmother Ines Prandini, 85, restarted an old alarm clock she's had for 30 years to ""give some sound to this time, to give some life to this time"" at home. The clampdown later was extended to cover all of Italy. After about a month, Toniolo's father returned home to Sardinia.

Marzio and his grandfather Gino play a game of cards at home. Things began settling down. But the real concern was Gino, who suffers from short-term memory loss. ""At the start, we were really afraid and did not let him go out. My grandmother used to go to church but when my grandfather started getting worse, she stopped,"" Toniolo said.

Gino and his wife Ines sleep at home on the 16th day of quarantine. Gino would go to bed early and wake up at 10 p.m. convinced it was breakfast time. He could not understand why he had to stay inside and ""coronavirus"" meant nothing to him, so the family told him the Spanish Flu had returned.

Marzio's family gather to watch a live broadcast of Pope Francis giving an extraordinary global blessing to an empty St. Peter's Square, where he urged the world to see the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis as a test of solidarity and a reminder of basic values. The Spanish flu hit between 1918-1920 and people of Gino's generation heard accounts about it when they were young. ""He knew what that was and he started to understand,"" Toniolo said.

Gino goes for a walk close to his home. Gino now wears a mask and goes for a walk, sitting on a bench while neighbours keep a discreet, watchful eye. Bianca also helps Gino adapt. ""No, grandpa, there's coronavirus about. You can't kiss me!"" she told him.

Marzio takes a picture as he participates in a video conference call with colleagues and the headmaster of the primary school where he teaches, to see how everybody's classes are doing. Toniolo and his wife Chiara send their students lessons and homework project via the internet. On Sunday, Italy announced a gradual easing of restrictions.

Marzio takes a picture of Bianca painting his toenails.

So with the help of her mom and fellow instructor Melissa Kerpel, the 15-year-old turned their unfinished basement into a fitness studio and has kept offering classes twice a week thanks to a laptop and the internet.

“We’ve had our old familiar faces and some new people from all around the country who have joined us,” said Julia, who’s believed to be one of the youngest instructors in the country licensed to teach Zumba.

Before the pandemic hit, Julia and her mom taught at Highland Park High School and the Lutz Family Center, with many participants coming from Working Together, a non-profit that supports low-income families in Highwood and Highland Park.

Just a few days after their last face-to-face class, the mother-daughter duo decided to give online teaching a try. The class went off without a hitch; participants receive instructions on how to join the class via Zoom.

“Everyone loved it,” Julia said. “We got some positive messages, and we thought, ‘Let’s keep doing it.’”

There have been a few challenges.

Not everyone taking their classes is computer savvy, and some have limited access to the internet. One participant does not have a smart phone, and her only access to a computer is at the public library, which is closed. So the Kerpels gave her a portable DVD player and some Zumba DVDs so she can keep dancing during the stay-at-home order.

Julia is a third-generation Zumba instructor, with both her mom and grandmother, Inez Garber, teaching the Latin-inspired, cardio-dance workout, though Garber isn’t co-teaching with her daughter and granddaughter at the moment because she’s sheltering in place apart from the family.

Julia’s love of Zumba started when she was 3 or 4; that’s when her mom started taking Zumba classes. “She loved it so much that she got certified and would bring me to her classes. I just fell in love with it ... the fun and party atmosphere,” Julia said.

“I love everything about it. Everyone can do it, no matter their dance experience or background. They show up and they have such a great time.”

Julia and her mom have had to dispel some misconceptions about Zumba: “People who are my age think it’s only for their moms and grandmas, which is completely untrue,” Julia said. “And the older generation thinks because they’ve never had any dance experience, they can’t do it.”

After years of doing Zumba — as well as ballet, tap, jazz and modern dance — Julia last year at the age of 14 was certified as a Zumba instructor.

“It’s not super common, but even just this (past) week we had a 17-year-old instructor in the D.C. area who’s been teaching virtual courses,” said Rebecca Dorfman, director of public relations and branded content for the Miami-based Zumba Fitness LLC.

“We do license people who are around her age as long as they have parental consent” and the parent is present while the teen is teaching, Dorfman said.

Kerpel said her daughter teaches under her supervision primarily for insurance purposes. Julia will be able to teach on her own when she turns 18 and plans to teach on her own when she goes to college.

While she declined to say how many licensed instructors are teaching Zumba, Dorfman said thousands of classes are now being offered virtually and more than 1 million people are participating. “Before this, there was no virtual component to Zumba.”

At a time like this, when so many people are under stress, Dorfman said any kind of movement is “super important.”

Deerfield resident Lisa Rosenberg agrees: “The fact that Zumba moved online is an absolute godsend for sanity, for health, for connection.”

Rosenberg, who takes classes from the Kerpels several times a week, said every hour of instruction flies by. And she’s even persuaded her husband to give Zumba a try because he doesn’t have to leave the house. Julia and her mom are “really easy to follow, so upbeat — which is important especially now.”

“She’s such a joy to watch. She always has a big smile on her face,” Rosenberg said of the teen instructor, who she jokes is helping Rosenberg keep off “the COVID 19” stay-at-home pounds, a reference to the “freshman 15” weight gain many college students experience during their first year away from home.

“Everyone morning I get up with them and I do the workout. And it helps me,” Rosenberg said.

Though they plan to keep offering some virtual classes once in-person instruction can resume, the mother-daughter duo looks forward to being back in the same room with their participants, who range in age from young children to grandmas.

“We miss being with each other and the joy and energy we create when we are dancing together,” Melissa Kerpel said.

“Other measures to ensure safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include “social distance wardens” to help shoppers navigate a new one-way system,” reports the Guardian.

Get ready; Our whole society is about to be patrolled by a new breed of busy-bodies telling you how to behave, where to stand, where to sit, where you can walk.

Karens all over the world are rejoicing at the prospect of getting paid for what they love the most – interfering in other people’s business.

All this in response to a virus which, according to the CDC, has a fatality rate of 0.26%, making it no more deadly than a bad bout of seasonal flu.

We’re pedantically re-arranging our entire society around social distancing cringe and empowering an army of new enforcers to make our lives miserable.

All in the name of transitioning out of a lockdown which, according to innumerable experts, will be responsible for more deaths than coronavirus itself.

The Theodore Roosevelt has been battling a coronavirus outbreak that saw more than 1,000 sailors test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

After most of the crew was evacuated ashore, thousands of sailors have started to return to the ship. But, the Navy reports that a number of sailors who were cleared to get back on after testing negative twice have retested positive for COVID-19.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The US Navy reports that the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, which was sidelined by a severe coronavirus outbreak, has had a sailor diagnosed with tuberculosis, another infectious disease.

""In the course of the ship's rigorous infection surveillance, a single active case of TB was identified and diagnosed,"" Pacific Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Myers Vasquez told Politico. ""The individual has been removed from the ship, isolated, and will remain under the direct care of the naval health system until cleared by doctors.""

Unlike the coronavirus, tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, but like the virus that crippled the USS Theodore Roosevelt, it can have a devastating effect on the lungs.

A coronavirus outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier upended its Pacific deployment and forced the ship into port in Guam, where the carrier has been since late March.

As the number of cases climbed, reaching 1,102 by the end of April, the Navy evacuated over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors ashore and placed them in isolation.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements. As of Thursday, 2,900 sailors had returned to the carrier.

Pacific Fleet said in a statement on Thursday that five sailors who had been cleared to return to the USS Theodore Roosevelt had retested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and were removed from the ship.

The five sailors had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The number of sailors who have retested positive for COVID-19 after getting back on the ship has more than doubled, Politico reported, revealing that a total of 13 sailors have retested positive.

The latest developments aboard the carrier represent new setbacks as the USS Theodore Roosevelt fights for a healthy ship that get once again get underway.

""We are committed to taking every measure possible to protect the health of our force,"" Cmdr. Vasquez told Insider in an emailed statement this week.

""As we continue to learn more about this virus,"" he said, ""the Navy will aggressively respond to COVID virus in accordance with the latest guidance and best practices, and then evolve and adapt as experience is gained.""",real

Numerous disturbing videos circulated social media on Thursday showing a black Michigan man beating an elderly white man and an elderly white woman in a nursing home.

Jaydon Hayden, reportedly from Westland, Michigan filmed himself beating elderly white nursing home patients for sport.

There were three videos on Bitchute showing the man beating white elderly men and women.

The man filmed himself beating the seniors in their beds until they were bleeding.

Judicial Watch boss Tom Fitton said the watchdog group contacted authorities after he was alerted to the disturbing videos.

“This was also posted on my Twitter feed and Judicial Watch contacted authorities who then, in response to our concern, arrested this person. Thanks to those who helped us get this done.” Tom Fitton said.

Tom Fitton said according to his sources, the man was arrested.

On Friday FOX 2 Detroit in Michigan spoke with the father of the Jaydon Hayden after his arrest.

The father said his son is not vicious, but that he just has mental health issues.

And the father then said this, “He said his son called 911 and was taken to a mental health facility in Ann Arbor. Last Wednesday, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and said he was supposed to be taken to another facility to be quarantined.

The father added, “It should’ve never happened because he should’ve never been put in that environment.”

Did you get that?

Authorities — following the orders of Governor Gretchen Whitmer — moved the young man to a nursing home to recover from COVID-19.

They moved 20-year-old Jaydon Hayden to the nursing home just last week.

According to his father, Jaydon Hayden was moved to the nursing home because he had COVID-19.

This tells us that Governor Whitmer is STILL sending COVID-19 patients to NURSING HOMES.

So not only was Jayden BEATING nursing home patients but he was spreading the coronavirus in the same nursing home.

The Attorney for the Westwood Nursing Center says they were not aware of the beating until they saw the video?

The attorney added that Jayden was not a long-term resident.

Well, that’s good!

And there’s more…

According to WXYZ.com the 75-year-old victim is a US veteran.

And according to WXYZ Jaydon was moved the hospital last Wednesday. The assault on the elderly man took place LAST FRIDAY!

And police did not arrest Jaydon until yesterday — a week later — at that same nursing home!

Jaydon Hayden beat the hell out of the seniors and was still in the facility a week later!

The Trump administration is considering the possibility of creating a new unit at the State Department that will deal with global responses to future outbreaks of infectious diseases, according to documents obtained by Politico.

Part of an effort in the President’s Response to Outbreaks (PRO), the proposal may also create “an alternative mechanism to some of the work” conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) following the White House’s move to suspend US funding for the UN body.

Politico reported that the new State Department unit was discussed during a recent National Security Council meeting, in a sign of the ongoing “turf battle” between the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

USAID officials were reportedly “surprised and perplexed by the idea, which could lead them to lose control of significant funds and authorities”. One USAID official was quoted by Politico as saying that the proposal was a “power-grab” by the State Department.

The news outlet also cited unnamed sources as saying that Doctor Deborah Birx, a senior US official who currently deals with Washington’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, may be at the helm of the new unit “if it becomes a reality”.

The proposed initiative stipulates the State Department appointing a coordinator who will oversee almost “every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response — from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernised protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak”, according to the sources.

Trump Weighs Restoring Partial US Funding for WHO

Plans on the creation of a new State Department unit come after President Donald Trump tweeted in mid-May that he was considering restoring at least 10 percent of US funding for the WHO that was frozen last month.

""This is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years”, he wrote in a tweet, adding that he has “not made final decision"".

Lou, this is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen. Thanks! https://t.co/xQUzHy4NDa — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2020

In April, POTUS announced that the US’ funding of the WHO would be halted over negligence, claiming that the UN health agency had impeded the global response to the coronavirus pandemic and let it spread by covering up the true scale of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China - allegations that Beijing rejects.

The US president also announced a suspension period of 60 to 90 days pending the completion of a probe of the WHO and China's actions during the onset of the pandemic.

The decision was slammed by the WHO and the international community, with the US Chamber of Commerce claiming that POTUS had compromised the country’s interests by ending Washington's funding for the agency.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for his part, underscored that it was ""not the time to reduce the resources for the WHO […] in the fight against the virus”. According to the organisation’s latest situation report, there are more than 4.9 million COVID-19 cases across the globe, with 327,738 fatalities.",fake
284,1672,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/2020-hurricane-season-coronavirus-273508,2020-05-21,"NOAA sees busy hurricane season, as pandemic strains emergency services","If 2020 does meet that forecast, it would mark a new record of five consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane seasons, surpassing a previous record of four seasons during 1998 to 2001, Gerry Bell, the lead forecaster with the Climate Prediction Center, told reporters.

NOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicted a 60 percent chance of an above-normal 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, with a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season. The agency predicted just a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season.

""NOAA's analysis of current and seasonal atmospheric conditions reveals a recipe for an active Atlantic hurricane season this year,"" said acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs in a statement.

The outlook for the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season also comes as researchers at NOAA and the University of Wisconsin-Madison identified a link between the growing intensity of tropical storms and human-driven climate change, mapping out the growing strength of hurricanes and typhoons over the past four decades.

NOAA said Thursday a combination of factors contributed to predictions for above-normal storm activity, including warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, as well as El Niño conditions that can suppress hurricane activity and are expected to remain neutral or to trend toward La Niña.

Should more of this year's storms make landfall, it could pose problems for state and local emergency responders and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which have been dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and would see their efforts complicated by social distancing and other measures enacted to slow the spread of Covid-19.

FEMA warned earlier this week that this year's hurricane season poses ""added complexities"" for first responders and state and local officials amid the pandemic. It's advised communities to secure ""non-congregate"" shelters for evacuees, such as hotels and dormitories, and ensure search-and-rescue teams and volunteers have proper protective equipment to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Carlos Castillo, acting deputy administrator for resilience at FEMA, told reporters that the agency has responded to more than one large disaster at the same time before, such as in 2018, when the agency responded to two major hurricanes on the East Coast and wildfires in California.

""I want to reassure the nation that FEMA continues to take deliberate and proactive steps, working closely with our state, local, tribal, territorial, federal, nonprofit and private sector partners to safeguard our ability to respond and recover from future disasters that may arise during this pandemic,"" Castillo said.

In a hurricane preparation guidance released Wednesday, FEMA said it will “generally minimize” deployments to disaster-hit areas, an acknowledgment of both strained capacity and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit unnecessary person-to-person contact to curb the coronavirus. Instead, FEMA will rely more on virtual coordination.

“If you’re in a situation where you’ve got a declaration or where a storm has hit, yeah, we are looking at ways to scale back,” FEMA spokesperson Lea Crager told POLITICO.

Social distancing measures also have complicated evacuation plans for areas that lie in a storm's path. FEMA has discouraged use of gymnasiums, arenas and convention centers that traditionally double as shelters. FEMA instead emphasized “non-congregate” shelters such as hotels and dormitories, and suggested people consider staying home even under conditions like power outages.

As a result, overall shelter capacity will likely be diminished this year, Crager said, meaning communities will have to “think outside the box” — though she acknowledged people might be afraid to go to shelters anyway given potential for viral infection. FEMA has tried to smooth the process for emergency planners by signaling to them early that it will reimburse a portion — typically at least 75 percent — of expenses for securing those types of non-congregate shelters.

The long-standing emergency plans that communities dust off every hurricane season tend to rely on massive shelters, so changing their procedures will present challenges, said Daniel Kaniewski, the former FEMA deputy administrator who left the agency in February.

“You want to get this nailed down with as much advance notice as possible so states can plan based on that policy,” said Kaniewski, who is now managing director at insurance firm Marsh & McLennan. “Honestly, when these policies change, it takes a lot of coordination and planning and even exercising of that new policy. You can’t just flip a switch.”

But some towns don’t have enough hotels or motels to meet local needs, said Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, which works with local governments along the nation’s largest river.

Even coping with the simplest preparations that FEMA has outlined is a struggle, he said, and many local governments will struggle to pay for rooms even if they have them, or to cover the costs for personal protective equipment and acquire tests needed to handle potential evacuees.

“What cities are telling me is they don’t have enough money right now to handle a pandemic and a major disaster at the same time,” Wellenkamp said. “We’ve spent so much money on the pandemic and our revenues have taken such a hit because of the closures and unemployment.""

Even if the federal government promises to reimburse localities, that ""doesn’t help you if you don’t have the cash to make the purchases in the first place,” Wellenkamp added.

The twin pandemic and hurricane efforts are also stretching nonprofit organizations that help locate shelter sites, staff evacuation centers and bring in necessary supplies and food, said Gregory Forrester, CEO of National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, a coalition of nonprofit groups.

Many volunteers are elderly and will be vulnerable to Covid-19, he said, which, combined with the imperative to keep the virus from spreading to new areas, means trying to find additional local personnel without underlying medical conditions. Many nonprofits also haven’t been able to fundraise for the hurricane season while they respond to the coronavirus.

“The cost factors are higher but you plan for a certain degree and hope for the best,” Forrester said. “But it’s like any other hurricane season — nobody could have ever predicted a Harvey and Maria within six weeks of each other” in 2017.",real

Prior to the waiver, Medicare was only able to pay for telehealth on a limited basis, for example, when a patient was receiving care in a designated rural area or when received the service in a healthcare facility. Under this waiver, the following changes have taken effect:

Office, hospital, and other telehealth visits will now be covered and reimbursed for the same amount as an in-person visit.

A wide range of providers can offer telehealth services across the nation, including nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed social workers.

Medicare beneficiaries are now able to receive a wider variety of services through telemedicine – such as evaluation and management visits, mental health counseling, and preventative health screenings.

The HHS Office of Inspector General is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programs during this time.

Virtual Services

Medical professionals can provide their Medicare patients with a range of virtual services as part of the telehealth program, including Medicare telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits. Specific requirements for each service are outlined below.

Medicare Telehealth Visits

Throughout the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, Medicare patients may use digital technology for office, hospital visits, and other services previously rendered in-person. The recent changes include:

A wider range of practitioners is now able to get payment covered for telemedicine services – including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, midwives, anesthetists, psychologists, clinical social workers, registered dietitians, as well as nutritional professionals.

Virtual visits will now be paid at the same rate as regular, in-person visits.

Providers must use an interactive audio and video system permitting real-time communication during Medicare telehealth visits in order to be reimbursed appropriately.

New CMS guidelines remove the requirement of an established patient-provider relationship for the duration of the public health emergency, further details below.

“The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a policy of enforcement discretion for Medicare telehealth services furnished pursuant to the waiver under section 1135(b)(8) of the Act. To the extent the waiver (section 1135(g)(3)) requires that the patient have a prior established relationship with a particular practitioner, HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that such a prior relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency,” the CMS statement reads.

Virtual Check-ins

In all areas of the country, Medicare beneficiaries will be able to have brief online check-ins with practitioners – or brief communication technology-based services. Policy changes related to this include:

Medicare will now pay for virtual check-ins for patients with established relationships with their physicians to prevent unnecessary travel and office visits.

Brief virtual check-ins can be conducted using a broader range of communication methods than Medicare telehealth visits; medical practitioners may bill for virtual check-in services provided via several telecommunication technologies – including telephone, audio/video, secure text messaging, email, and patient portals.

Services cannot be related to a medical visit within the previous 7 days or lead to a medical visit within the following 24 hours, or the soonest available appointment.

Patients must verbally consent to receive virtual check-in services.

Patients can submit video/images using store and forward methods to be interpreted by physicians within 24 business hours.

E-Visits

As part of the updated guidelines, established Medicare patients in all types of locations can have non-face-to-face patient-initiated communications with their providers using online patient portals. These services can only be rendered in accordance with the following guidelines:

E-visit services can only be reported to Medicare if the billing practice has an established relationship with the patient.

E-visits must be initiated by the patient although practices may educate patients on the availability of these services prior to their initiation.

Communications can occur over a 7-day period and only after the patient provides verbal consent to receive telehealth services.

These services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061.

More information on relevant billing codes for e-visits and other virtual care services can be found on the CMS’ website.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Updates

In addition to the amendments above, the HHS Office for Civil Rights will lessen restrictions and waive penalties in association with HIPAA compliance for health care providers that serve patients in good faith through virtual communication technologies during the COVID-19 outbreak. More information on the latest HIPAA updates can be accessed here.

Although Medicare already offers flexibility to states that wish to implement telehealth services, the most recent developments signal a major step forward in the direction of telemedicine, despite the temporary nature of federal guidelines. With the help of changes in regulations and the strategic expansion of telehealth, patients can now reach providers easily via a range of telecommunication options from the comfort and safety of their homes, while medical professionals can readily provide care without reimbursement concerns. As the COVID-19 public health emergency continues to evolve rapidly, regulations and guidelines may change; clinicians are encouraged to stay up-to-date on the latest medical guidance.",fake
290,172,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196100/immigration-borders-covid-19-coronavirus,2020-03-27,The coronavirus pandemic is no excuse to crack down on immigration,"Editor’s note, April 21st, 2020: Donald Trump tweeted on April 20th that he would sign an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration to the US in response to the pandemic. It’s not yet clear how this would work or who would be affected if Trump follows through. But it’s an alarming threat given the president’s broad powers to regulate immigration and his previous moves to push through hard-line policies during the COVID-19 crisis. This piece was published before that tweet, but its points about the futility of using immigration policy to fight a virus are more relevant than ever.

To get myself through the pandemic, I’ve been summoning everything I’ve learned about surviving in a new world as an immigrant. I left the Philippines as a kid to join my parents in California. “Walang tiyaga, walang nilaga,” my grandma used to say. Strictly translated, it means “no perseverance, no stew.” That lesson on weathering hardship recently took on new meaning.

I’m not just worried about the virus. Reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans are up, while President Trump continues to characterize the disease as “foreign” and “Chinese.” Some of my friends are worried about heading outside not only because of the virus, but because of the racist slurs hurled at them.

Went to take out trash.Was talking on phone in Chinese. Man walked by on sidewalk & in interest of social distancing,I said,""sorry, go ahead."" ""FUCKING CHINESE,""he yelled loud enough I could hear him over aide's voice on phone. I turned to look at him to make sure I heard right — Jiayang Fan (@JiayangFan) March 18, 2020

Filipinos, like other immigrant groups, tend to be overrepresented in jobs on the frontlines of the pandemic. The Philippines sends more nurses abroad to staff the world’s health care systems than any other country in the world. Filipinos also make up a third of all cruise ship workers and, in China, are the largest group of migrant domestic workers. The service industry that delivers food to our doorsteps relies on immigrants, too.

immigrants are overrepresented in jobs on the frontlines of the pandemic

Many of the neighborhoods where people of color and immigrants live have more air pollution, which can be deadly during outbreaks of a virus that affects the lungs. For instance, Latinos are over 51 percent more likely to live in counties with dangerous levels of smog than non-Hispanic whites. That can lead to chronic conditions such as asthma that make someone especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Pollution has also been linked to heart disease; people with serious heart conditions are also at higher risk of getting seriously sick from COVID-19.

There’s more. Some immigrants are afraid to seek care because they are worried that they will endanger their own immigration status by doing so. Under a new rule, a person who uses public benefits like Medicaid can be denied a green card. This doesn’t apply to permanent residents renewing their green cards, but misinformation is already stopping people from getting care. After pushback from Democrats, US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it wouldn’t penalize green card applicants for getting treatment or testing for COVID-19. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on March 18th that it won’t “carry out enforcement operations at or near” health care facilities; advocates and doctors worried that the fear of getting swept up by ICE might keep people from getting care. But that might not matter if people are too afraid to see a doctor.

With any disaster, some people are hit first and worst. There are parallels between the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental injustice, says Mustafa Santiago Ali, who led the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to address environmental racism and injustice under the Obama administration. In both crises, the people facing the greatest risk are often people of color, working class families, and the poor. “More of our folks are going to die disproportionately,” he says, meaning black, brown, and indigenous communities. The people calling the shots don’t come from the places that are most affected — so they often don’t understand what’s happening on the ground. They might even make decisions that make things worse.

“More of our folks are going to die disproportionately.”

Now, the Trump administration is using the pandemic as an excuse to push hard-line immigration policies it would have pursued anyway, says Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “[They’re] really taking advantage of this moment, even though it’s a questionable decision to pour resources into that,” she says. “Maybe we should be concentrating more on finding masks for doctors and nurses than we should be on kicking asylum seekers out of the country.”

Pierce thinks more people will lose their work authorization or violate their visas because US Citizenship and Immigration Services has shut down its offices and suspended in-person meetings that immigrants must attend to keep their legal status. That means more people could face deportation or detention in facilities that, like prisons, can become hotbeds for disease. While immigrant rights advocates are calling for detention centers to shut down, the Trump administration is using them to fearmonger.

People in detention could pass the virus on to customs and border patrol officers, and “even the United States population as a whole,” US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in a March 20th briefing on the pandemic. “Migrants in [detention] facilities are drawing on an American healthcare system that is already fighting the coronavirus pandemic,” he added. That day, the administration announced it would begin to remove anyone crossing US borders illegally, including people seeking asylum, immediately without due process.

I’ve heard this crap my whole life: that immigrants take more than we give — whether that’s overburdening health care, snatching jobs, or whatever — so let’s send them away. Racism and xenophobia has always threatened my existence in this country.

That “us versus them” flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics

That “us versus them” flavor of fearmongering is common in epidemics. Italian immigrants were scapegoats for the New York City polio epidemics in 1907 and 1916. Cholera was called “Asiatic cholera” in the 1800s and tuberculosis called the “Jewish disease” in the 1900s. Thousands of people died from AIDS before the Reagan administration began taking the epidemic seriously in the mid-1980s, after making callous jokes about the disease referred to as “gay plague.”

“With this new virus, something was triggered that is always latently there, under the surface, which is this fear of the other and the idea that bad things come from elsewhere,” York University professor Roger Keil told The Verge in February.

The virus is already spreading in the US; it’s useless to scapegoat migrants at our borders when we now have more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world. The Latin American country with the most cases of COVID-19 is Brazil, which had 2,433 cases on the 26th — just over one-tenth of the number of infections in New York City alone. It seems likelier that migrants in detention centers will get sick here. And deporting people who were infected in the US back to other countries means spreading the disease further.

Shifting blame onto others does nothing to keep Americans, including myself, safe. It’s a waste of energy when every moment matters in our response to the crisis. I’ve watched New York City’s local officials plead daily for ventilators and federal assistance. As someone who calls this place home, this is terrifying. My mom and many of my aunties are nurses in the US; they need more masks and medical supplies to keep people healthy.

Division only makes dealing with disaster harder

Division only makes dealing with disaster harder, both Ali and Pierce told me. Another lesson I’ve learned from my community is that the only way we beat the odds is when we show up for each other. My aunt, uncles, cousins, and grandmothers stepped in to take care of me in the Philippines until my parents were on solid footing and could send for me. Together, they got me here to where I am today. The only way to get through this crisis will be to do so together, too. My mom and aunties will take care of you when you get sick. Make sure to take care of them, too. They’re immigrants, and we’ll need them.",real

Get the best Trump news straight to your inbox!

Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared for interviews Friday and dropped a grenade into the nation’s reopening conversation.

Stay-at-home orders intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus could end up causing “irreparable damage” if imposed for too long, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Friday. “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said during an interview with CNBC’s Meg Tirrell on “Halftime Report.”

Indeed. The country has only been discussing this very topic for weeks now, as between 38.6 and 43 million Americans have been thrown into unemployment thanks directly to the coronavirus shutdown.

The discussion has not included Dr. Fauci, and he appears to have been sidelined from making public comments by the White House in recent days. During those same days, President Trump has increasingly called for states to lift restrictions and let the reopening begin.

During the same interview, Dr. Fauci poured some cold water on reopenings that are underway, but in that passive-aggressive way of doing so without being specific.

“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,” he said. “There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.”

Not helpful. Who is jumping ahead? Florida — which has not seen a spike despite dire media predictions that it would? Texas — which is crab-walking toward reopening while about 46% of its coronavirus deaths statewide have been in nursing homes? Or is California taking entirely too long? How about Michigan and the whimsical Gov. Whitmer?

People need to work. The economy crashes and a whole lot more people will die the longer the shutdowns drag on.

While some in the capital cocktail set see Dr. Fauci as a sex symbol, he has been a panic peddler during much of this crisis.

For instance, May 13, 2020: As states reopened, Dr. Fauci warned of “needless suffering and death” if states move too fast.

Unemployment was already well over 20 million by then, or roughly the whole population of the state of New York. A million of those newly unemployed are healthcare workers. Hospitals and medical practices have been creaking and threatening to collapse since early April.

Since then, we’ve blown past that unemployment number, past Florida, past Texas, to leave the equivalent of the entire population of California unemployed.

Plus or minus a million or two.

How, in what universe, can unemployment on this scale not cause “irreparable damage?”

Especially when an estimated 42% of these unemployed and their jobs are never ever ever getting back together?

Our energy sector went from powering everything to being vulnerable to foreign takeover in a flash.

Whole national job-creating companies have filed for bankruptcy or laid thousands of their workers off.

And the federal government is writing hot checks in the trillions every few weeks.

This is by definition “irreparable damage,” Dr. F.

I haven’t been too critical of Fauci up to this point. He’s an epidemiologist trying to prevent mass death from a virus. His job is not to worry about the economics.

But it’s looking increasingly like we need a second opinion, from another doctor who also has run a practice and therefore understands economics. As Sen. Rand Paul, who is a doctor, noted in Senate testimony in mid-May, Dr. Fauci isn’t the “be all end all” of this crisis. Dr. Fauci actually agreed. And he’s not.

The economic dimension of this crisis has long stayed in the back seat while the healthcare dimension took the wheel. That was reasonable in the beginning. It’s a pandemic, which is a medical crisis first and foremost.

They both need some time in the driver’s seat. We’ve flattened the curve. There’s no evidence at this point (it could change!) that reopening is causing serious spikes in new infections. We still haven’t come to grips with the facts on nursing home and assisted living facitlity-related coronavirus deaths nationwide. That discussion has not happened in any serious way.

Neither has the necessary discussion about suicides related to economic misery.

We’re past time for all that.

298,13,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/are-officials-china-downplaying-infection-numbers/,2020-02-05,Are Officials In China Downplaying Infection Numbers?,"Some agencies are reporting that officials in China are keeping two sets of coronavirus infections numbers: a set they let the public see, and the actual numbers. Recently this infectious disease has been spreading globally, and experts have been warning that China has been significantly understating the true numbers of infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus.

Now apparently evidence has emerged that allegedly supports those sentiments, and this evidence appears to indicate that officials in China are keeping two sets of numbers regarding what they want the public to know about the numbers of infections and deaths and the actual numbers.

“As Taiwan [News] reports in a report first spotted by user @TheHKGroup, over the weekend, Tencent “seems to have inadvertently released what is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths, which were astronomically higher than official figures”, and were far closer to the catastrophic epidemic projections made by Jonathan Read,” reports Zero Hedge.

“Netizens also noticed that each time the screen with the large numbers appears, it shows a comparison with the previous day’s data which demonstrates a ‘reasonable’ incremental increase, much like comparisons of official numbers. This has led some netizens to speculate that Tencent has two sets of data, the real data and ‘processed’ data,” the publication to Taiwan news reports.

Officials in China claim to be updating websites such as QQ.com daily, the official numbers still list the infections to under 25,000 and it appears to be expanding at roughly 20% per 24 hour period which represents a doubling of infection every 3.5 days due to growth being compounded.

Observers have noticed an inadvertent slip in the official numbers being reported by the communist Chinese government to suddenly show far higher numbers of confirmed infection and deaths being at 154,024 infections and 24,589 deaths, before being reverted back to the much lower supposedly official numbers.

Naturally first reactions may think it was a typo being corrected, but there appears to be more to the official story that is not wanted to be known. The higher numbers did not appear by themselves, and they were not out of context. Above each number is an increase factor that calculates how much more the day’s current numbers are compared to the previous day. For the 24,589 deaths in the lower right of the chart the number above it displays as +1546, the Chinese characters beside it explain compared to yesterday. The number above the infection count of 154,023 displays as +20979, the Chinese characters beside that similarly explain day over day increase from the previous day.

This indicates that there is an underlying database that is tracking these daily numbers that is being used to calculate differences. The numbers are being automatically calculated, if human error were to blame for inputting the incorrect numbers it would be highly unlikely that two more incorrect numbers would coincidentally also appear above those numbers to accidentally show day to day increases that are consistent with a second set of numbers being stored in parallel.

Of course it could all just be some form of a typo, but it supports claims of the Chinese government having two sets of numbers relating to the coronavirus, and releasing numbers that are significantly far less than the real numbers to the public.

Taiwan New Reports:

Some are speculating that a coding problem could be causing the real “internal” data to accidentally appear. Others believe that someone behind the scenes is trying to leak the real numbers.

However, the “internal” data held by Beijing may not reflect the true extent of the epidemic. According to multiple sources in Wuhan, many coronavirus patients are unable to receive treatment and die outside of hospitals.

A severe shortage of test kits also leads to a lower number of diagnosed cases of infection and death. In addition, there have been many reports of doctors being ordered to list other forms of death instead of coronavirus to keep the death toll artificially low.

W.H.O is praising China for its “transparency,” but is the praise unjustified? Based on videos, reports, whistleblowers, doctors and independent journalists who are reporting from within China, it seems that officials in China are, not surprisingly, trying to significantly downplay the true number of infections and deaths associated with the outbreak of the coronavirus being shown to the rest of the world. The allegedly leaked numbers are more in line with what experts are suggesting, but it could just be a coincidence as well.

Are officials in China trying to significantly downplay the true numbers regarding the coronavirus???",fake
307,1885,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/class_warfare_will_worsen_the_pandemic.html,2020-05-23,Class Warfare Will Worsen the Pandemic,"Medieval depictions of the bubonic plague often illustrated a “dance of death,” portraying peasants, noblemen, and clergy all equally afflicted by the plague. The current pandemic affects people of all classes too. It made front page news when actor Tom Hanks (net worth approximately $400 million) announced he and his wife had contracted COVID-19.

Public opinion about Hanks, a beloved entertainer, is almost universally sympathetic, but attitudes toward the rich as a whole haven’t changed during the pandemic. Wealthy people remain easy targets for social prejudice and mistrust.

The headlines say it all. In GQ last month: “How Are Rich People Getting Richer During the Coronavirus Pandemic?” The month before that in the Atlantic: “It Pays to Be Rich During a Pandemic.” A recent Axios report detailed a smorgasbord of similar stories, all about wealthier individuals fleeing to private islands or using private health care to protect themselves from COVID-19. Axios quoted a progressive scholar who lambasted “an undercurrent of unequal sacrifice.”

Although news is supposed to be unbiased, classism is hard to shake. Supposedly neutral articles about bonuses and salaries often featured sweeping generalizations, along with negative and highly emotive terms such as “greed,” “gambling,” “excess,” “filling their pockets,” and “obscene.”

On the other hand, although Oxfam’s reports on wealth inequality in recent years have been criticized rightly for questionable methodology, widespread coverage of the reports often took their findings at face value. That’s likely because Oxfam’s central claims and the organization’s general thrust against “the super-rich” are closely aligned with much of the media’s editorial viewpoints. Thomas Piketty’s book Capital in the Twenty-First Century received similarly favorable coverage.

It’s not surprising that this media bias reinforces the public’s negative view toward the wealthy. But although researchers have extensively studied other stereotypes and prejudices, very little work has been done to understand prejudice based on social class, and even less has been done on “upward classism.” An international comparative survey measured what people in the United States, Germany, U.K, and France think of the rich. The survey asked questions that identified whether participants had a sense of “social envy.” It turned out that social envy is highest in France, followed by Germany. It is significantly lower in the United States and U.K, but there’s a caveat: younger Americans were more likely than older Americans to resent and distrust the wealthy, showing that America may soon be like continental Europe in this regard.

Social envy enables scapegoating or assigning blame to an out-group for societal problems. The comparative survey showed that nearly two-thirds of social enviers tend to scapegoat other groups. Scapegoating depends on a kind of a zero-sum thinking, and many respondents across the nations surveyed agreed that “The more the rich have, the less there is for the poor” -- an assumption belied by the way that classes across a society commonly rise and fall together.

Like any other stereotype, these negative views toward the rich discount or ignore the many individuals who are virtuous or working to solve global problems. Unconscious bias toward the rich lumps white-collar criminals and unscrupulous businessmen together with Bill Gates, who created a world-changing computing system and went on to devote much of his fortune toward philanthropy, including hundreds of millions of dollars on coronavirus research. These biases probably make it easier for people to accept strange conspiracy theories about Gates, such as the idea that he wants to use the pandemic to start a world government or use vaccines against it to depopulate the world.

Class bias is western society’s unaddressed blind spot. Someone biased on a class basis is only a hop, skip, and jump away from adopting bias toward other groups -- especially during a crisis like the current pandemic. If one blames the rich for society’s problems, it’s no surprise that they’re just as capable of blaming an entire race. Some think classism and racism come from opposite sides of the political spectrum, but that’s not always true. Many episodes of genocide, like those in Rwanda and Cambodia, have had elements of both.

These biases harm society as a whole. If people do not understand the real causes of crises and negative events, choosing instead to believe simple explanations and assign blame to an easy target, this gets in the way of finding real solutions to problems like the current pandemic. Just as we now know that the bubonic plague was spread by rats and fleas, rather than by witches or Jews, we should be able to reject scapegoating in our own time.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. blamed the pandemic and the effect it has had on court operations, but the case has been tainted by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct.

This story was originally published on May 5, 2020, by THE CITY.

Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. is blaming the coronavirus pandemic to justify dropping charges in a major construction fraud case tainted by allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, THE CITY has learned.

In what appears to be the first instance of COVID-19 knocking out a high-profile criminal prosecution in New York City, Vance revealed in court papers filed Monday that he won't put a key bribery case back before a grand jury.

That's because the actions of sitting grand juries have been suspended and no new panels have been convened since mid March when the coronavirus forced the shutdown of much of the state's court system.

The case dropped by Vance involved one of several defendants in a wide-ranging construction bribery prosecution that's now the subject of an internal review. At issue are accusations that the lead prosecutor in the case, Diana Florence, withheld evidence undermining her star witness.

One of those defendants was Henry Chlupsa, a former executive of an engineering firm charged with bribing the witness, a city bureaucrat, for inside information to win multi-million-dollar contracts.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber convicted Chlupsa in November following a three-week non-jury trial. Weeks later, Chlupsa's attorney, Nelson Boxer, learned that the DA's office had failed to turn over thousands of internal emails and interviews with the informant in which he claimed he never took bribes from anyone.

In January, Nelson asked Farber to vacate the conviction and dismiss the indictment.

Bid to 'conserve resources'

In a court filing Monday, Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Moore Jr. agreed the conviction should be vacated, conceding the DA's office hadn't handed over the disputed material as it should have.

Moore insisted, though, the criminal charges against Chlupsa were still viable. But because of the COVID-19 restrictions on grand juries, the DA decided not to bring a new case against the now 77-year-old Chlupsa, Moore said.

""In an effort to conserve resources, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic, and for the other reasons described below, the People will not be seeking to re-present new charges against the defendant to a new grand jury,"" Moore wrote.

""In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, no new grand juries will be convened for the foreseeable future,"" he noted.

Under normal circumstances, grand juries — which in New York consist of 23 citizens meeting in a room to hear evidence — vote on whether to hand up an indictment.

An indictment is a formal allegation that must be resolved either by plea or trial. Law enforcement is required to bring a case to a grand jury within six days of arrest or release the defendant.

But with COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the criminal justice system and making it impossible for 23 New Yorkers to gather in a relatively small room, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order suspending that rule. The state Office of Court Administration shut down grand juries until further notice.

Danny Frost, a spokesperson for Vance, said the Chlupsa case is the only major case dropped by the Manhattan DA so far due to the virus crisis.

Frost said prosecutors handling other ongoing grand jury investigations are still able to issue subpoenas and continue pursuing cases. But he acknowledged that because the grand juries cannot meet in person, they cannot vote to indict.

That's put all cases pending when the virus struck are now in a state of suspended animation. The stuck-in-time cases include major white collar fraud, public corruption and racketeering prosecutions.

Probes go on

It's not just a challenge for Vance's office: The city Department of Investigation, for instance, had multiple pending cases before grand juries when the virus all but shut courts.

Diane Struzzi, a DOI spokesperson, said Tuesday that the agency's investigators are finding ways to work around the frozen state of grand juries.

""Not convening grand juries has had an impact on how cases move forward, but that situation has not resulted in the abandonment of any DOI case or a slowdown in DOI's work,"" Struzzi said.

She added that DOI investigators are instead ""focusing on case aspects that can be accomplished consistent with remote work and social distancing.""

That's led to prioritizing investigations that involve a lot of email and records review over cases that require door-knocking and interviewing witnesses, Struzzi said.

The judge who convicted Chlupsa must still approve the motion to vacate that conviction.

On Tuesday, Boxer, Chlupsa's attorney, stated, ""After a long, hard fight, it's a big step towards justice for Henry.""

But he disagreed with the DA's assessment that it was still possible to bring a case against his client. Boxer contended the case was fatally damaged by the DA's office withholding of evidence.

The Chlupsa decision by Vance marked the second time charges against defendants in the big construction bribery case overseen by Florence have been tossed. In February, another judge threw out the case against another engineer, Kyriacos Pierides, calling the scope of the withheld evidence in that case ""staggering.""

As THE CITY revealed in January, Florence resigned from the DA's office and was replaced as head of Vance's Construction Fraud Task Force. Vance has said his office is reviewing the handling of the bribery case — scrutiny that Frost said Tuesday was ongoing.

Florence has said she turned over the material as soon as she learned of its existence. In her resignation letter, she charged she faced a ""hostile work environment,"" ""bullying"" and interference with pending legal cases while for Vance.

315,1936,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-cuomo-shipped-off-coronavirus-patients-to-ny-nursing-home.html,2020-05-23,"Report: Cuomo shipped off 4,300 coronavirus patients to NY nursing homes","(Natural News) Over 4,300 recovering COVID-19 patients were shipped off to New Yorkâs nursing homes and long-term care facilities as a result of a controversial state directive, according to The Associated Press.

In a count published on its site Friday, the news organization tallied the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and transferred to nursing homes under Gov. Andrew Cuomoâs March 25 directive after the New York State Health Department declined to release the figures gleaned from its internal survey, conducted two weeks ago.

The health department is still verifying âincompleteâ data.

According to critics, the directive, which had been intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged, instead only helped speed up the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus in the mentioned establishments, in addition to placing an additional burden on already overwhelmed facilities.

âA number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,â said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

According to numbers posted by New Yorkâs Department of Health, the state’s nursing home COVID-19 death toll stood well over 5,000 as of this writing, making it a significant chunk of the stateâs total running death toll from the virus.

The directive, which also noted that the stateâs nursing homes and related facilities cannot refuse patients, was reversed on May 10.

Following intense criticism, Cuomo, in his subsequent media briefings, said he was merely following recommendations set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

No matter how much Cuomo spins the said directive however, Stuart Almer, a nursing home operator, said it cannot be denied that the state order still put staff and residents at great risk.

âWe canât draw a straight line from bringing in someone positive to someone catching the disease, but weâre talking about elderly, fragile and vulnerable residents,â Almer stated in an interview with AP. (Related: New York nursing homes now a âslaughterhouseâ for elderly coronavirus patients.)

According to Almer, his staff at Gurwin Jewish, a 460-bed nursing home on Long Island, had to scramble in order to accommodate what he called a âfloodâ of 58 recovering COVID-19 patients from local hospitals.

Almer stressed that while they did what they could to ensure the safety of their residents, such as by erecting more walls and by implementing other safety measures, residents at Gurwin nonetheless started falling sick, 47 of which died of confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

The families of those who died are furious.

“It was the single dumbest decision anyone could make if they wanted to kill people,” Daniel Arbeeny told the AP in an interview.

According to Arbeeny, his 88-year-old father succumbed to the virus after being pulled out of a Brooklyn nursing home that saw more than 50 deaths.

“This isn’t rocket science. We knew the most vulnerable were in nursing homes and rehab centers,” Arbeeny said, citing studies that pointed to the elderly and immunocompromised as being the most likely to succumb to the virus.

Former New York lieutenant governor and Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths founder Betsy McCaughey did not mince words when speaking about the current situation in the stateâs nursing homes.

âTheyâre death pits,â McCaughey told The New York Times.

âThese nursing homes are already overwhelmed. Theyâre crowded and theyâre understaffed. One COVID-positive patient in a nursing home produces carnage,â she added.

As of press time, the state of New York has recorded a running total of 358,000 infections and 23,195 deaths from the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The Versailles Court of Appeals upheld a lower-court ruling that led the e-commerce company to close six of its fulfillment centers in France and put workers on paid furlough. Amazon had said the definition of what goods it could ship was not clear and rather than risk being fined, opted to temporarily close the fulfillment centers.

Under the French court ruling, Amazon can only deliver items directly related to medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items in the country during the coronavirus pandemic. It must conduct a risk assessment of its warehouses with labor unions. The unions took Amazon to court for what they considered a failure by the company to protect warehouse employees from exposure to the coronavirus.

The company tweeted in response to the ruling, “We have heard the outcome of our appeal and remain puzzled by the decision. We are currently assessing the implications for our sites as well as for our employees and customers in France.”

Nous sommes en train d’en évaluer les implications pour nos sites ainsi que pour nos collaborateurs, pour les clients en France. — AmazonNewsFR (@AmazonNewsFR) April 24, 2020

The Versailles Court of Appeals said if Amazon violates the ruling the company would be fined €100,000 (about $108,000) for each delivery that does not meet its conditions. The court will revisit the company’s progress next month.",real

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Friday Democrats should pull the plug on their national convention in Milwaukee, already pushed back to August because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and hold a virtual event instead to officially tap Joe Biden as their presidential nominee.

In a telephone interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Durbin discussed the coronavirus crisis as the nation faces another week under stay-at-home orders.

Lockdown life

Durbin’s been working out of his Springfield home the past three weeks. Congress is on recess to avoid spreading COVID-19. He wears jeans, khakis and sweats most of the time.

Durbin started putting on a mask the past few days and says he feels like a bandit going into a store. He goes to his office for Facebook sessions with Illinoisans because the internet connection is better. Durbin and wife Loretta order take-out often to support local restaurants.

Small Business Administration loans: Sees controversy on the horizon

On Thursday, after just two weeks, a stampede of applicants exhausted a new $346 billion Paycheck Protection Program appropriation. The PPP is designed to help employers meet payrolls, pay some operating costs and have the loan forgiven.

Durbin said shoveling so much money out the door so fast means “the day we take a look at the loans that were given and the loans that were turned down, there’s going to be a controversy, I’m just sure of that.”

Democrats and Republicans agree about pouring another $250 billion into the PPP pot, though Democrats want some changes to fix what appear to be inequities in loan approvals. “We definitely need it,” Durbin said. A key issue for Democrats is to make sure a portion the second round of PPP loans go to minority-owned businesses squeezed out of the first round of PPP because they did not have strong relationships with lenders, who gave priority to their best customers.

Durbin also wants more transparency. He is concerned, he said, that “companies that suffered no losses because of this COVID are still qualifying for substantial forgivable loans.”

Milwaukee convention

Asked about the national convention, Durbin said: “I think it will be a virtual convention. I think the likelihood that we’ll be able to assemble any kind of crowds, whether it’s for a convention or for a football game or a baseball game is really at this point highly unlikely” until “we have a vaccine that is effective and widely distributed.”

Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee postponed its presidential nominating convention to Aug. 17. The gathering at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee originally had been scheduled for July 13-16. The GOP convention is set for Aug 24-27 at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.

“God bless the people of Milwaukee. We’ll have a big party up there with bratwurst at some later date but I just don’t think it’s practical to ask people to travel from all over the United States to gather in a large crowded group,” Durbin said.

On joining Trump’s Opening Up America Again Congressional Group

Durbin was on a call with President Donald Trump and many other senators Thursday for this newly created White House group that is without — so far — a specific agenda. He said he urged that state and local governments get substantial financial assistance in the next round of emergency funding; that issue is part of the debate over extending the PPP.

Durbin, founder of the movement to legalize the status of “Dreamers,” people brought to the U.S. illegally while underage, said he asked Trump to avoid deportation threats during the COVID-19 emergency. Trump yanked Dreamers’ legal protections, and a case protesting his action is pending in the Supreme Court.

Trump “says what he always says,” said Durbin, who has been to this rodeo with the president before. Trump, according to Durbin, said: “‘We are going to take care of those young people, don’t worry about that.’ He told me that the day he was sworn in, and we know what has happened since. He didn’t do what he said.”",real

The letter — co-written by Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., and Donna Shalala, D-Fla., and co-sponsored by more than 60 other members of Congress — calls on the Trump administration and more than a dozen federal agencies to immediately provide all relevant materials on the pandemic in Spanish and other languages.

“As a matter of public health and safety for all, English-language proficiency should not serve as a barrier to obtain or distribute vital information from the federal government,” the letter reads. “Failing to immediately provide guidance in Spanish and other languages will jeopardize the health, safety, and economic stability of millions across this country.”

Agencies named in the letter include the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Small Business Administration and the IRS.

A White House representative could not be reached for comment.

Census figures show more than 65 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home. About 25 million people in the country did not speak English proficiently in 2015, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a version of its website in Spanish and “simplified” Chinese. It has also translated information about the coronavirus into dozens of languages during the past couple of weeks.

Natural disasters can raise pressing questions for religious believers who believe in a sovereign God. One question which inevitably arises is, “What is God doing in this?” For the almost 2 billion Muslims who make up a quarter of the world’s population, this is an important question. How might Muslims respond when they seek to frame a spiritual response to the pandemic? And what spiritual resources might their faith offer them in the face of this disruption to their lives?

For Muslims, there are specific religious obligations which social distancing requirements interfere with, especially communal prayer in mosques, pilgrimage, and washing the body of the dead.

Over recent months, most Muslim organizations around the world have been supporting social distancing measures brought in by their governments to control the pandemic. In Saudi Arabia Muslims were ordered not to perform their prayers at mosques, but to perform them in their own homes. The Australian National Imams Council issued a ‘Public Statement’ on 18 March, which gave Australia Muslims similar advice.

Islam offers a system of guidance for human behavior. Ordinary Muslims are expected to follow the guidance provided by those who are more knowledgeable about Islam than they, and ultimately the guidance issued should be based upon the Quran and the Sunna (the example and teaching) of Muhammad. These sources, to which legal reasoning is applied, are the foundation for the practice of Islam. Complying with this guidance is believed to bring benefits in this life and the next.

Most Muslim scholars would say that attending Friday communal prayers is obligatory for all Muslim men. The Quran instructs Muslims to leave their places of work on Friday and hurry to prayer (Sura 62:9), and there is a tradition of Muhammad which says that recording angels sit at the gates of mosques to keep track of all who attend (so their participation will be rewarded). But how to comply with this requirement during a pandemic?

To relax an obligatory requirement of Islam requires an exception which can trump the obligation. There is a principle in Islam that prevention of harm, especially to Muslim lives, can overrule other obligations. Thus the Australian Fatwa Council’s fatwa on COVID-19 applied the principle that “Islamic Sacred Law protects the life of a Muslim,” in order to grant an exemption to Muslims from attending communal prayers. The International Fiqh Academy, a peak global body of Muslim jurists, put it this way, in a statement delivered on 20 April, that under necessity, “Almighty God has allowed people do to what is forbidden, and to omit what is obligatory”. IFA’s comprehensive fatwa endorses such measures as closing businesses, using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, wearing masks and gloves, closing mosques, and generally adhering to the health directives issued by authorities, even if this interferes with Islamic requirements.

In relation to pandemic restrictions, of particular relevance are traditions of Muḥammad which refer to exemptions for attending mosques, and traditions which refer to contagious diseases. There is a tradition that during cold, windy wet weather, Muhammad instructed Muslims to pray in their homes. This establishes a precedent for an exemption to mosque attendance for health reasons. On the other hand, there is another tradition which could be taken as guidance to ignore contagious diseases. Muhammad is reported to have said, ‘There is no such thing as vermin (poisonous snakes, scorpions etc), contagious disease, or an evil omen.” Islamic traditions report some controversy among Muhammad’s companions concerning this statement. Some report that there was an additional balancing comment made that “the ill should not be taken to the healthy.” This second part of the tradition has been cited by Australian Imams and other Muslim leaders to support social distancing.

At stake here is a theological tension between the empirically observable principle of cause-and-effect, and a Islamic doctrine that everything happens according to the Divine Decree. Islamic teaching especially emphasizes that each soul dies at the precise time preordained by Allah. I remember an engaging discussion with Muslims in an Indonesian village early in 1980, about the fate of Marshall Tito of Yugoslavia, who was being kept alive on life support systems. The villagers had seen TV images of Tito in his hospital bed. Was it possible, they asked me, to prolong someone’s life past the time of death predetermined by Allah? It was made very clear to me that the correct Islamic answer was, ‘No it is not’. The influential Salafi sheik, Muhammad Saalih al-Munajid has observed that not even murder violates Allah’s sovereignty over the time of death: ‘the one who kills a person has not taken anything away from the lifespan of the one who was slain; rather Allah, may He be exalted, decreed that from eternity.”

The issue of divine sovereignty over epidemics also features in traditions in which Muhammad states that plague is sent by Allah, so “when you hear that it has broken out in a land, don’t go to it, and when it has broken out in the land where you are, don’t run out of it.” This might sound rather like a sensible restriction on travel for quarantine purposes, but in reality the logic is that if Allah is punishing a particular region with plague, it is senseless to try to evade his judgement, and if divine judgement is falling upon a region, it makes no sense to throw in your lot with them.

There is a telling discussion of this tradition reported in the Sahih Muslim. ‘Umar was leading Muslims on a raiding party to Syria when they received word that the plague had broken out there. Umar sought advice, and decided to turn back. Then a follower asked, “Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree?”, the implication being that it was futile to try to avoid a date with destiny set by the creator himself. Umar replied, “We are running from the Divine Decree to the Divine Decree.” He then gave the illustration that if you take camels into a valley, and there is green grass on one side and none on the other, whichever side you choose, it will be the Divine Decree. So to take steps to avoid plague must be considered as pre-ordained by Allah as dying from the plague after you get infected from entering plague territory.

No doubt with all this in mind, the Australian Fatwa Council’s ruling on COVID-19 began by asserting the sovereignty of Allah over death: “Life and death are absolutely within the decree of Allah alone, exalted be He. This is a reality, no matter what secondary causes appear to be.” The second paragraph continues, “No human shall die until it has completely exhausted its destined provision (rizq) and lifespan (ajal). Death is one of the decrees of Allah.” So if someone dies from COVID-19, it is because Allah has willed it. However, after asserting the principle of divine sovereignty over death, the fatwa defends attending to ‘secondary’ causes, such as infectious disease. Accepting the reality that Allah takes life by secondary causes is, the fatwa states, “part of our belief in the decree and destiny that Allah has established in the world.” So engaging with and acting in accordance with our understanding of ‘secondary’ causes is also the Divine Decree. Therefore, the fatwa urges, “a Muslim repels the decree of illness and transmissible diseases with the decree of protection, treatment and medicine.”

The Australian Imams were wise to urge Muslims to support the government’s policy of social distancing. Several early cases were reported from around the world where large gatherings of Muslims played a critical role in spreading COVID-19, including in Malaysia and India. In Indonesia it was reported in April that, at the instigation of Muslim leaders in the province, mosques continued to be open to thousands to attend Friday prayers together. One Acehnese congregant stated that she prefers to attend the mosque because ‘the reward is bigger [for praying in the mosque on Friday]… so no matter how afraid we are, most importantly is that we believe it is Allah’s provision’ and another suggested that “maybe by worshipping, Allah will keep the disease away from us.” She would rather trust in God’s sovereignty than miss out on the potential spiritual benefit of attending mosque.

There are risks for Muslims in applying certain Islamic teachings concerning epidemics. One risk is to emphasize the Divine Decree at the expense of the ‘Decree’ of preventative measures. According to a tradition attributed to Muhammad, plague may be a punishment for some, but for genuine believers it could be a source of mercy, so that if a believer trusts in the Divine Decree for his life during an epidemic, and he falls sick and dies, he will receive the reward of a martyr, i.e. paradise with all the options. Here is the full text of the hadith:

“I asked Allah’s Apostle about the plague. He told me that it was a Punishment sent by Allah on whom he wished, and Allah made it a source of mercy for the believers, for if one in the time of an epidemic plague stays in his country patiently hoping for Allah’s Reward and believing that nothing will befall him except what Allah has written for him, he will get the reward of a martyr.” (Sahih al-Bukhari)

This teaching might be considered an incentive to get infected, if it means attaining to the status of a martyr!

There is also theological pressure in the Quran, at the core of Islam, to see pandemics in terms of divine punishment. The Quran speaks repeatedly of the wrath of God falling on groups of people as punishment for rejecting past messengers. Quranic punishments include earthquake, fire, flood, windstorms, thunderbolts, and airborne projectiles. This emphasis is so pervasive, especially in the earlier, ‘Meccan’ passages of the Quran, that there can easily be a tendency to consider all natural disasters as acts of divine punishment. For example, when the Tsunami devastated South East Asia, the Saudi-based cleric, Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid announced it to be a punishment upon unbelievers for evil practices associated with holidays, such as adultery, drinking alcohol, and dancing: “the Almighty Lord … showed them his vengeance”.

A very practical risk for Muslims if they interpret epidemics as divine punishment is that they might not take necessary precautions against infection. This is a risk for the followers of the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, who boasted that he and his followers have no need for social distancing: “We pray fives time daily … we stick together. We join hands. We eat from one bowl. We are doing very, very, very well. We have anti-virus. You have coronavirus, we have anti-virus.” Early on in the progress of the pandemic, as reports of COVID-19 devastation were coming in from China and then Iran, some Sunni Muslims clerics declared that this was God’s judgement against China for persecuting Muslims, and against Shia Muslims for being heretics. Those who assume that the epidemic is God’s judgement against other people could be tempted not to take adequate precautions themselves. Later, of course, the pandemic came for Sunnis too.

There are political risks for religious communities who do not observe health requirements. In India, Muslims were blamed by Hindu extremists for the spread of the virus. At one point, one in five confirmed cases in India was linked to a single three-day long meeting of the Tablighi Jamaat movement in New Delhi. After this event a government raid on the movement’s compound discovered the largest virus cluster in India. The authorities arrested 29 people, including 16 foreigners who attended the meeting, and as news of these events spread there were incidents of discrimination and hatred against Muslims across the country. (At the same time, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 have also provided opportunities for increased persecution of non-Muslims in some countries. For example, reports have been received from Pakistan that a NGO denied COVID-19 related food aid to poor Hindus and Christians, and a Muslim cleric boasted on Pakistan television that a destitute Christian was offered food in exchange for conversion to Islam. These actions have been called ‘reprehensible’ by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.)

We have seen repeatedly that large gatherings of people in close proximity, whether for sports, religious observance, parties, or even a choir practice, can turbo-charge the spread of COVID-19. Islam mandates for large gatherings of men in mosques, and afterwards these men potentially could spread the virus to their families. It is not an easy thing for Muslim communities to suspend communal gatherings, given that they play such a central role in Islamic spirituality. This is especially true of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Despite a hadith which states that angels prevent plague from entering Mecca and Medina, there have been multiple large-scale epidemics which decimated pilgrims: 20,000 pilgrims died of cholera in 1821 and 15,000 in 1865 (one sixth of all pilgrims that year). (However it is considered especially meritorious to pass away on the Hajj.) This year the Saudis have suspended the year-round umra pilgrimages to Mecca, and the Muslim world is still waiting for a decision from Saudi Arabia concerning the Hajj, which is due to commence in late July.

Islam offers a system of guidance, and Muslim leaders are speaking up all over the world to offer this guidance, addressing the many challenges caused by the pandemic. Most scholars are using their spiritual clout to instruct Muslims to follow guidelines issued by national authorities. This guidance is intended to release Muslims from the invidious position of being conflicted between religious requirements, and the requirements of the state. At the same time, there are theological drivers in Islam which could lead Muslims either to regard the pandemic as a punishment for non-believers, and thus not a serious risk for sincere Muslims, or to downplay the risk in favor of the perceived benefits of maintaining meritorious religious practices. Some Muslim communities may consider the tenets of their faith, including the requirement for men to gather for Friday prayers, to take precedence over anything a secular government might give them. The pandemic requires Muslim leaders to balance certain aspects of Islamic teachings with sensible medical advice, and when Islamic leaders do not align the guidance they are issuing with sound medical advice, the health outcomes for Muslims can be expected to be poor.

In countries which are trying to achieve compliance with pandemic measures, it is important to recognize that for many pious Muslims, religious requirements can take precedence over human-made laws of nations, if they interfere with core requirements of Islam. In order to secure the compliance of their Muslim citizens with health advisories and social distancing rules, the state needs Muslim organizations to issue guidance mandating the compliance of the faithful. There are risks, both for Muslims and rest of the community if this does not happen.

The following is direct from the agency’s website:

""Person-to-person spread

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

The virus spreads easily between people

How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.

The virus does not spread easily in other ways

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads. It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads.

From touching surfaces or objects. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.

From animals to people. At this time, the risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is considered to be low. Learn about COVID-19 and pets and other animals .

From people to animals. It appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations.

Learn what you should do if you have pets .

Protect yourself and others

The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. You can take steps to slow the spread.

Maintain good social distance (about 6 feet). This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

Everyone Should

Wash your hands often

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact

Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.

Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.

Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.



Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people .



Do not gather in groups.



Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.



Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick .

Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others

You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.

Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.

Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.

Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.

Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

Cover coughs and sneezes

If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.

Throw used tissues in the trash.

Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Clean and disinfect

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants

will work.

Monitor Your Health

Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.

Especially important if you are running essential errands , going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet .

Take your temperature if symptoms develop.

Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.

Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.""

“Direct contact with people has the highest likelihood of getting infected — being close to an infected person, rather than accepting a newspaper or a FedEx guy dropping off a box,” said virologist Vincent Munster, a researcher in the virus ecology section at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facility in Hamilton, Mont.

In laboratory settings Munster and colleagues have demonstrated that this virus can potentially remain viable on cardboard for up to 24 hours and for up to 3 days on plastic and metal surfaces, but it will typically degrade within hours of being outside a host.

“A persistent problem in this pandemic has been lack of clear messaging from governmental leadership, and this is another unfortunate example of that trend,” said Angela L. Rasmussen, a virologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “It could even have a detrimental effect on hand hygiene and encourage complacency about physical distancing or other measures.”

Rasmussen said the new CDC language will not alter her habits. “I wash my hands after handling packages and wipe down shared surfaces with household disinfectant,” she said. “In my opinion, that’s all that is necessary to reduce risk.”

CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said the revisions were the product of an internal review and “usability testing.” “Our transmission language has not changed,” Nordlund said. “Covid-19 spreads mainly through close contact from person to person.”

The previous version archived on the website does include the same statement about surfaces as the current version: “It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.”

For anyone who still wants to wipe down plastics and packaging with disinfectants if it makes you feel better, there is no harm in doing that. Just be sure to wash your hands afterwards to get the chemicals from off your skin and please do not wipe down food with these disinfectants.

“I did not agree that his parents should come in to town, with Seattle being the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak at the time,” she says. “He did not think that I should have my friend, who also cuts my hair, come to my house even though she had been in quarantine for several weeks. These are new kinds of disagreements that have come up with coronavirus, and do cause some tension.”

Many of us might be thinking we need a family therapist about now. In fact, sociologists, psychologists, therapists and relationship trainers say they are already hearing from clients and patients, even though no one is actually seeing them in person (it’s taking place by phone or online via video links).

“They won’t apply the words, ‘it’s because of the virus or the pandemic that I’m feeling this way,’ “ says Mandy Mitchell, a licensed clinical social worker at the Center for Counseling and Wellness in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ”Instead, they say, ‘I wanted him to buy seven cans of corn and he only bought three’ and they think they’re arguing about corn when what they’re really arguing about is the need to feel secure and stable.”

All families have underlying issues; in times like these, they’re exacerbated or easily triggered, thus launching potentially toxic interactions, says family therapist Helen Park of Manhattan’s Ackerman Institute for the Family, a mental-health clinic.

“It’s just so much more pronounced now because the climate for everybody is such an acute, pervasive level of anxiety,” Park says. “That kicks up the sympathetic nervous system; the fight-or-flight fear responses are very much always on. That’s where you get problematic cycles of interactions, which are so difficult to interrupt if you’re in a heightened state.”

Indeed, American households are dealing with a whole new level of fraught these days, one that makes the usual squabbling seem tame.

Elizabeth Tenety, a co-founder of and occasional columnist on the popular parenting site Motherly.com, says she’s noticed how virus lockdown is affecting her own family; she and her husband are the parents of four kids under 7, and both are working from their New Jersey home.

“A week or two ago, I just attacked my husband — I had what I now understand, after a lot of reporting and writing about it, was a natural human reaction to so much uncertainty and terror,” says Tenety, co-author of “The Motherly Guide to Becoming Mama.”

“I’m trying to cope with demands, he’s not coping the way I want him to be coping, and I handled it in the worst way, very accusatory,” Tenety says. “We’re hearing from our audience there are thousands of women saying ‘me, too, I’m fighting with my partner’ more.”

Stacey Engle, president of Fierce Conversations, a Seattle-based corporate training and coaching firm (based on a self-help book of the same name), says her company trains people on how to have “better conversations” aimed at listening and communicating with less rancor. Now that they’re delivering their training online to couples and families, they’re advising clients that existing tensions can be resolved or ameliorated before relationships become irreparable, Engle says.

“Because a core idea is that the conversation IS the relationship,” Engle says. “If you want an open, loving relationship, you need to have the same in conversations.”

Teaching people “the skill of listening to understand rather than to form your rebuttal” is the aim of the Seattle-based Gottman Institute, which preaches a research-based approach to relationships and trains certified therapists like Mitchell. She says she’s seeing an increase in conflict among her clients they hadn’t experienced since they started therapy.

”It might look like anger but it’s really just fear, because that’s a very primal part of us as human beings,” she says. She tries to help people learn to dial down accusatory and aggressive interactions. “How do you approach any subject in a way that is gentle and kind and shows what we call unconditional positive regard, meaning: I love you no matter what.”

Even in the best of times, it takes work to consciously de-escalate tensions or remember to just check in regularly with each other, says Tenety. She and her husband have arranged an ad hoc shift system to give each time off from dealing with kids, school, household chores and work during quarantine.

“We’re hearing this a lot from the parenting community, about being as empathetic and generous with your partner as you would want him or her to be with you,” says Tenety. “I’m so fried at the end of the day, I am going to bed early but my husband is staying up and working on his garden, so I give him the space he needs to cope, and I get the space I need to sleep.”

Tziporah Rosenberg, an associate professor in the Departments of Psychiatry & Family Medicine at the University of Rochester medical school.

“If they avoided hard conversations or fought over every difference before, you can reasonably expect that’s how they’re handling things now,” Rosenberg says. “For most people, it’s not the time to hatch brand new skills.”

And it does take skills to cope when the anxiety meter is soaring because of fear.

“When we’re fearful we’re not operating at our best,” Rosenberg says. “We’re operating out of survival instincts and there’s not a lot of room for empathy, compassion, patience, listening deeply — those are higher-level skills.”

So what can be done? It’s not like you can flounce out of the house in a huff.

Engle suggests taking a straightforward approach: Address and talk about whatever needs to be talked about in a non-confrontational way.

“If there are issues occurring or bothering you, you have to name it, get clear about it and why is this an issue, and get more clarity to prepare to have a conversation with whoever is involved,” Engle says. “You’re addressing issues with a person alongside a person, it’s not confronting a person.”

In the midst of an argument, remember to hit the “pause” button, says Rosenberg.

“We’ve recommended this for years, (that) when couples get into arguments, blow the whistle and take a time out,” she says. “Go to mutual corners and revisit the conversation a half-hour later. It takes our brains at least that long to come down from agitation.”

That time-tested technique is even more relevant now, says Engle. “In this time, you have the opportunity more than ever to pause, reflect and connect with the people you live with in new and meaningful ways,” she says.

Try self-soothing and self-care techniques. Take a yoga class online or learn to meditate via an online course. Look for a celebrity workout routine on Instagram and try it. (Check out Jane Fonda’s on TikTok.) Lose yourself in a book, work in the garden or even take a nap.

Kirsten Ngheim, who lives with her husband and two young sons on Bainbridge Island, Wash., says so far she and her husband are in harmony about their lives in lockdown, and maybe it’s because she’s focused on her garden in trying to prepare for the unknown.

“I’m thinking more about planting foods that grow plentifully, further reducing the need for store runs,” she says. “But I’m also planting lots of flowers, which evoke an appreciation for nature, happiness, and love just by seeing them. Creating joy in beauty (and) inspiring mental health.”

Another thing to remember is that a therapist is only a video link away. “One of the great things is that there are all these resources for self-care so readily accessible online,” Park says. “Normally these workshops or retreats, you have to show up in person and pay a lot of money. Now they’re free online.”

Cypher says she tries to focus on the positive aspects of her situation in Seattle. Not being in the same house with her ex makes things easier, she says.

“We don’t have constant exposure to one another so in that sense we aren’t getting on each other’s nerves the way some folks who share a home probably are,” she notes. “As this continues, I’m sure other issues will come up but fortunately thus far, it’s been relatively smooth.”

It might help to remember that millions of families are struggling to cope, too. You can tell because people are talking about it online and on social media. Or joking about it.

“Thank God, my wife has multiple personalities. I’m quarantined with a different person everyday and its not boring at all,” joshed Paul Barbar.

“Is this a tension headache caused by my friends and family still not taking this pandemic seriously, or am I just coming down with the novel coronavirus: a fun, daily question!” tweeted Tiffany C. Li, an attorney and legal scholar.

Even America’s celebrity sweethearts want to throttle each other. Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, married since 2013 and parents of two young daughters, openly admitted it in a video interview with Katie Couric last month.

As the lovey-dovey couple sat next to each for the video, the tension was obvious on camera.

“This is as physically close as we’ve been in a couple of days ‘cause we’ve just found each other revolting,” Bell said, sharing they had been “at each other’s throats real bad.”

There will be plenty of collusion among the Democratic Party, the American press, and the Chinese Communist Party to prevent President Trump from winning re-election come November. It just won't be reported or turned into a news story of any kind. Journalists will not spend the next six months breathlessly screaming about the national security implications of America's most lethal geopolitical foe ""waging war"" on American democracy. Reporters will not accuse Joe Biden of being a bought and paid for Chinese spy. There will be no special counsel investigations into Chinese influence on Facebook or Twitter or on random quilting messaging boards. Neither Robert Mueller nor Rod Rosenstein will invent some dangerous new interpretation of the First Amendment to turn online political speech by Chinese internet trolls into criminal fraud against the United States. Nobody will talk about the large American corporations now controlled by Chinese interests or the large amount of prime real estate the Chinese communists secretly own from Bangor, Maine to San Diego, California. Nobody will care that the state-owned Bank of China provided Hunter Biden's investment firm with $1.5 billion in financing for development of the same facial recognition surveillance software the communist dictatorship uses to control its citizens' movements. Just as anyone who questions the veracity of the 2016 ""Russian collusion"" myth is dismissed as a quackish conspiracist by the mainstream media, anyone who points out the obvious ""Chinese collusion"" taking place right before our eyes will be just as quickly accused of quackery, too. It will be the most important story of the 2020 election that never merits mentioning.

For most of the mainstream press, this glaring journalistic malpractice is yet another testament to how un-American they really are: their hatred of President Trump outweighs any nagging regret they might harbor for aiding and abetting Beijing's security interests. Just as Ted Kennedy and members of the American press conspired with Soviet general secretary Yuri Andropov to defeat President Reagan in the 1984 election in exchange for a promise to scrap Reagan's plan to deploy mid-range nuclear weapons to Western Europe, China Joe and the American press will justify weakening the United States security posture against China today if it means victory for the Democrats and their communist friends tomorrow.

The Chinese communists are at war with America, the press have chosen a side, and we're not on it. In the last five months, China has negligently or intentionally released a virus from Wuhan's Biosafety Level 4 Laboratory; covered up the existence and spread of the disease by ""disappearing"" doctors and journalists; denied the communicability and lethality of the virus when containment was possible; bullied and bribed the World Health Organization into praising the Chinese Communist Party's handling of the emerging epidemic; sent its citizens on airplanes around the world so that the resulting infection and economic misery would be shared by all; held the United States hostage by denying life-saving drugs and medical equipment; threatened U.S. naval vessels with EMP attacks and near-miss collisions; preposterously deflected all of this bad behavior onto the Trump administration through a spectacular regimen of propaganda gladly eaten up and served back to the world by a compliant, snake-in-the-grass Western press; and taken advantage of the global chaos it initiated by escalating its conquest of the South China Sea, taking over territorial fishing and mining claims belonging to other nations, and disrupting international shipping lanes, all while strengthening its industrial stranglehold of the West by maximizing the damage to its overseas competitors during the crippling economic shutdown it created. China has terrorized the world with its lies and malicious behavior and has taken every advantage to make the pain and suffering as bad as possible. It has been a friend to no one but itself. In a world crisis of its own making, its priorities have been to quash free speech and calls for governmental reform in Hong Kong; bully Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia into conceding legal territorial possessions; and blackmail American companies from repositioning their supply lines away from Chinese soil.

For decades, China has manipulated its currency, dumped its steel to destroy American industry, sent us poisoned dog food and cheap plastic trinkets, and pursued a barely concealed geostrategic chess game against the U.S. in preparation for future war. In every sense of the word, the Chinese Communist Party declares itself our enemy. Yet every day the American press corps parrots China's official state-issued talking points as gospel while calling the president of the United States a liar and villain to his face. To them, it is more important to worry whether a geographically correct description of the Wuhan coronavirus conveys unconscious racial animus on the part of everyday Americans than to investigate whether China's deliberate efforts to suppress discussion of the virus' existence or potential methods for its containment ultimately generated far greater death and economic destruction around the world than the Chinese acknowledge.

The media ignore China's use of concentration camps for imprisoning and ""re-educating"" millions of their citizens. They ignore China's absolute control of ""politically correct"" speech through an ever-expanding surveillance matrix. They ignore China's race-based segregation and sex-based slavery. They ignore the Chinese Communist Party's explicitly stated intention to destroy the United States and become the master civilization of our future world. Since the collapse of Nazi Germany, the world has never witnessed a more menacing proclamation by a national government that a ""mandate of heaven"" justifies a right to rule over all other nations. And just like Winston Churchill's repeatedly ignored warnings about that evil empire and ""the gathering storm"" leading to WWII, the Democrats and American media today have taken up the mantle of Neville Chamberlain in ignoring the looming storm that might well engulf us in WWIII. The press shed false tears over President Trump's aspersions toward their profession, when it is China that rules those people from afar. Like the Midwestern industry and manufacturing plants our ruling establishment gladly handed over to the communists long ago, the American press give their allegiance to our enemies willingly and with open arms.

On the issue of communist China, the 2020 election could not be more stark.

Trump: ""China is raping our country."" They are ""neither an ally or a friend — they want to beat us and own our country.""

Biden: ""China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man.""

Trump: ""The Chinese M.O. is simple — Lie, Cheat & Steal in all international dealings."" Chinese negotiators ""want to take your throat out, they want to cut you apart. These are tough people. I've dealt with them all my life.""

Biden: ""[The Chinese communists] are not bad folks, folks[.] ... They're not competition for us.""

Trump: ""There are people who wish I wouldn't refer to China as our enemy. But that's exactly what they are. They have destroyed entire industries by utilizing low-wage workers, cost us tens of thousands of jobs, spied on our businesses, stolen our technology, and have manipulated and devalued their currency, which makes importing our goods more expensive — and sometimes, impossible."" China's outmaneuvering of the United States represents ""the greatest theft in the history of the world.""

Biden: ""I believe that a rising China is a positive development — not only for China but also for the United States and the world.""

Does the world's largest communist dictatorship have a vested interest in the outcome of our presidential election? Obviously. Is China's highly motivated effort to elect Joe Biden president newsworthy? Of course. Will it get any attention from the American media in 2020? Absolutely not. In typical Chinese fortune cookie form, all they know is distilled into three sad, transfixing words: Orange Man Bad.",fake

You should ask about the basics, including the dates of your deferral period, interest rates, and late fees.

Ask how deferral could impact your credit score, property taxes, and homeowners insurance.

If possible, get the terms of your deferral in writing and jot down your ticket number and the customer service agent's name so you can dispute any issues that may come up later.

As millions of Americans lose work due to the coronavirus, mortgage lenders are stepping up and offering assistance. You may be able to defer mortgage payments so that you don't lose your home if you can't pay right now.

There are no hard and fast rules about how lenders should handle mortgage deferrals — so when you set up your deferral, be sure to ask questions about how the process will play out.

If you're on the fence about deferring, the answers to these questions could help you decide whether it's the right move for you. If you know you need to defer payments to make ends meet, asking these questions will help you know what to expect.

11 questions to ask your lender when deferring mortgage payments during the coronavirus

1. Do I qualify for deferment?

First things first: Is deferment even an option?

Some lenders will ask for proof of economic hardship, including pay stubs or a letter from your employer. Others will accept your application without asking follow-up questions.

2. How long will my deferment period last?

If you have a government-backed loan through Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHA, USDA, or VA, you should be able to request up to 180 days of forbearance — and then ask for another 180-day extension if you're still financially struggling after your initial deferral period.

If you don't have a government-backed mortgage, you'll have to adhere to the lender's policy about deferral period lengths. Be sure to ask how long deferral lasts and whether the company considers extensions if you still can't make payments when your deferral ends.

3. What are the exact dates of my deferral period?

You may know your mortgage is deferred for three months, 120 days, or 180 days — but what are the exact dates? When will you have to make your next payment?

Write these dates down so you don't misunderstand and miss a payment later, only to be slammed with a late fee. Also, if you find out the deferral period is retroactive, you may be able to receive a refund for your most recent payment.

4. Will deferring hurt my credit score?

Many lenders have issued statements saying they won't report forbearance, missed payments, or late payments to credit bureaus so your credit score can stay in tact. But considering your credit score holds a lot of borrowing and buying power, it's good to double-check before you enroll in forbearance.

5. Will I be charged late fees?

Few lenders are penalizing people with late fees during the pandemic, but double-check to be sure.

6. Will interest continue to accrue?

Even though lenders are pausing mortgage payments, it's rare for them to suspend interest on your loan. Ask whether interest will continue to build and discuss how that could practically affect your loan.

7. When and how do I have to pay back the deferred amount?

The repayment process is probably the most confusing aspect of enrolling in mortgage deferral during the coronavirus pandemic. Some lenders offer just one repayment option, while others provide multiple choices. Here are the most common methods:

Repay the deferred amount in one lump sum once your deferral period ends.

Tack the missed payments onto the end of your loan term. For example, if you defer payments for three months, your loan term switches from 30 years to 30 years and three months.

Spread the deferred amount across the life of your mortgage so that your monthly payment increases.

If your mortgage is backed by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, you can request a specific repayment method beginning July 1, 2020: Make one lump sum payment when your mortgage term ends. This means you pay the total deferred amount when you sell or refinance your home, or when you pay off the home completely.

8. Will deferral hurt my chances of getting financing in the near future?

Even during the pandemic, deferral is often a sign of economic hardship. As a result, many lenders won't offer additional home financing if you enroll in deferral — at least not until you prove yourself to be a responsible borrower again, which could take months.

This means you could struggle to refinance or buy another home in the next year or so.

There's no concrete rule about lending after deferral during the coronavirus outbreak, so it's possible your lender will make an exception. Don't be afraid to ask upfront.

9. How will deferral affect my taxes and insurance?

Some people pay their property taxes and insurance separately from their mortgages, while others bundle it all into one payment. Ask your lender if you still have to pay taxes and insurance while your mortgage is in deferral, or if you can pause all these expenses.

10. Can I get this agreement in writing?

Customer service agents are human — it's possible they'll tell you incorrect information.

Maybe your lender says it won't report deferral to credit bureaus, but you see it pop up on your credit report and your score plummets. Or you get hit with a late fee even after a customer support representative said there wouldn't be any penalties.

In these cases, having an email or letter with the terms of your deferral can help you dispute issues.

11. Can I have your name and/or my ticket number?

If you face penalties or your credit score is docked even though the customer service agent said there wouldn't be a problem, having their name on hand could give your argument more validity.

Many customer service departments assign emails and chat sessions ""ticket numbers,"" so knowing yours can help you resolve a problem more quickly later.",real

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama. https://t.co/ofKNYvrRKl — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 18, 2020

Sherman attempted to explain away the matter by suggesting that to unmask an American “caught” communicating with a foreign official of a hostile country is routine, even advisable. But the question frames the matter incorrectly. – READ MORE

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas announced that the Palestinian state and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) will no longer adhere to the agreements they signed with Israel and the United States. It is a reaction to Israel’s intentions to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. If Abbas’s intentions are consistently implemented, it would be a paradox for Palestine to abolish itself.

“The Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian state are rejecting any commitments from all agreements with the US administration and Israel, including those related to security,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in response to the Israeli government’s intention to start on July 1 the process of annexing territories controlled by illegal Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

Abbas did not mention any specific agreements, but it is believed he is referring to a series of agreements signed by the Palestinians with Israel in the 1990’s – the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1997 Hebron Protocol, and the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.

However, by cancelling the Oslo Accords, could the Palestinian Authority be abolishing itself?

If Abbas is referring to the entire Oslo Agreement, it would in a way mean the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, since they emerged from that agreement. Abbas’s reaction was caused not only by the intention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex large areas of the West Bank on July 1, but also by the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel, who undoubtedly supports the move.

Security coordination with Israel, which Palestine could be giving up, is one of the most important aspects of the Oslo Agreement, which has become a cornerstone of the so-called peace process. Security coordination is essential for the day-to-day functioning of both the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority is highly dependent, in daily terms, on this cooperation with the Israeli authorities. And not only on security, but also on economics, as well as on the inflow of financial resources, which come from the Israeli government to Palestinian institutions.

Even in earlier announcements, despite the interruptions, the essential parts of the implementation of coordination were never questioned. Abbas is now more serious than before when he announced and threatened to sever security ties which could be a blow to Israel, even if it means the Palestinian authorities lose the legal basis of its existence in international eyes.

Secretary of the Palestinian Fatah organization, Fayez Abu Aita, said that in these circumstances breaking all agreements, including the Oslo peace agreement, was absolutely necessary – this is the only way to protect their territories.

“It is not our fault that we are now on the edge of a new stage, a new great confrontation with Israel. Only by breaking all obligations with Washington and Tel Aviv, Palestine has the chance to defend its right to exist, the right to own land. After all, we said that we would not allow the implementation of the Deal of the Century. The Israeli government only heard itself and its greed. But this was only the first step: the further the Israeli side goes, the more serious the Palestinian response will be,” he said. “There is nothing else left for us, considering how quickly Israel extends its hands to our land. They were the first to bring the situation to a dangerous dead end.”

If Israel annexes the West Bank, hopes of creating an Arab state within the 1967 borders will be extinguished.

While the U.S. supports Israel’s annexation, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday in a telephone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazim confirmed the readiness of Russia to further promote the resumption of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is trying to prevent the annexation and, through diplomatic means, gather an international quartet with the participation of the UN.

Effectively Russia could be using this as an opportunity to present itself as a peace broker in the Palestine-Israel conflict. Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen, but is necessary when it appears there is a strong chance that the Palestine-Israel conflict can breakout extremely violent again in the coming weeks amidst the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

Updated at 2 a.m. ET Tuesday

In New York City, as the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic continues increasing, officials say the city may have to temporarily bury some of the dead at a public cemetery in Long Island Sound.

New York City Councilman Mark Levine says that if the death toll doesn't level off soon, the city will likely start doing ""temporary interment."" New York City's data indicate that total deaths in the city averaged nearly 150 per day before the pandemic. On one day recently, the city reported that 806 people died in a single day.

In an interview, Levine said, ""It would be done in a way that allowed these bodies to then be disinterred and given a proper burial at such time as the crisis is over and our normal cemetery system and funeral home system are running again.""

In a string of tweets, he detailed contingency plans for handling the dead. Trenches, he says, would be dug in a city park for caskets that would be placed 10 in a line.

This tweet has gotten a lot of attention. So I want to clarify: the is a contingency NYC is preparing for BUT if the death rate drops enough it will not be necessary. https://t.co/6wLO8qWtML — Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) April 6, 2020

However, later Levine clarified that the plan was only a contingency and might not be necessary — and still later that no bodies would be buried at city parks, after all. Instead, temporary interment, if necessary, would take place at a public cemetery on Hart Island, in the Bronx, he said.

A spokesperson for Mayor Bill de Blasio also confirmed in a tweet that the city was not planning to use parks as temporary burial sites.

We are NOT currently planning to use local parks as burial grounds. We are exploring using Hart Island for temporary burials, if the need grows. https://t.co/LfgGjULjh8 — Freddi Goldstein (@FreddiGoldstein) April 6, 2020

Levine said 80 refrigerated trailers big enough to hold 100 bodies each have been deployed to hospitals in the city. Some hospitals now have added a second and even third trailer, holding the remains of people who died from COVID-19 or other causes. With so many dead, funeral homes and cemeteries in the region are unable to keep up.

""People who lose someone to this virus, they're calling half a dozen funeral homes, and there's just no way now to get served through those normal channels,"" he says. ""You really can't get a burial in a cemetery at all now. Their resources are stretched and they have no capacity to handle the number of people who need burials.""

Asked about the city's plans for dealing with the growing number of bodies, the mayor confirmed officials were looking at contingency plans, but wouldn't go into details.

""We will have the capacity we need,"" de Blasio said. ""We may be dealing with temporary burials so we can then deal with each family later. But again, I'm not going to detail it.""

The mayor said the Defense Department had sent personnel and equipment to help, but that ""it's going to be very tough.""

Levine, who is the chairman of the New York City Council Health Committee, conceded it's a tough topic, but one he felt needed to be discussed in public. ""We need more help. We need more resources. We need more staffing for our city's mortuary system, just like we need more doctors and nurses,"" he said.",real

Michael Brochstein | Barcroft Media | Getty Images

House Democratic leaders plan to pass a $3 trillion coronavirus package Friday, even as Senate Republicans and the White House pledge to block what would be the largest emergency spending bill in U.S. history. The chamber aims to vote on the legislation by Friday night, along with a rules change to allow voting by proxy during the pandemic. Democrats are expected to pass the more than 1,800-page bill, despite growing unease in the party's right and left flanks. The sprawling proposal addresses Democrats' priorities to combat the economic and health crisis created by the outbreak: relief for cash-strapped state and local governments, another direct payment to Americans, hazard pay for essential workers and money to boost U.S. testing capacity. But it includes some more politically thorny elements, such as a provision to temporarily roll back the cap on state and local tax deductions — a move expected to help higher-income people most.

As Republicans question the need for more immediate fiscal relief, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi describes the bill as an opening proposal in the next phase of the congressional response, which already carries a price tag approaching $3 trillion across four bills. ""So now, we're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation,"" the California Democrat told reporters on Thursday. The Senate has no plans to touch the bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Thursday called it ""an unserious product from an unserious majority."" The Trump administration also issued a veto threat. The efforts to approve more relief come as U.S. Covid-19 cases top 1.4 million, and American deaths from the disease surpass 85,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. As the U.S. unemployment rate spiked to 14.7% in April, states started to lift lockdown restrictions and business closures designed to slow the outbreak. In pushing for more federal relief money, Democrats have cited Wednesday comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said ""additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery."" Despite President Donald Trump's opposition to the current legislation, he would be open to another coronavirus relief bill, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. Meanwhile, two administration officials told CNBC that the White House would likely support another round of stimulus checks to individuals. On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNBC he is ""optimistic"" Congress can reach a deal on another coronavirus response plan and called for talks with Republicans. Later in the day, McConnell outlined two priorities he wants to see in a bill: provisions to increase testing capacity and legal protections for doctors and businesses as the economy starts to reopen. He called a liability shield — which Democrats have generally criticized — a ""red line"" in future legislation.",real

But even in the best-case scenario, if a new administration begins on January 20, the new president will be required to take bold steps to ensure that the United States will never again be so unprepared for a crisis.

Secrecy and misinformation from the highest levels of government have worsened the effect of COVID-19. And although sunlight may not be the best disinfectant when it comes to the coronavirus, shining a light on our response, and guaranteeing transparency around future preparedness, will begin to treat the disease that has infected our democratic institutions.

Once a vaccine or treatment is in sight, it may be tempting to put the coronavirus era behind us. But failure to take a hard look at our response is naive and dangerous and will leave us vulnerable to similar or worse outcomes in the future.

A nonpartisan 9/11-type commission must detail what went wrong and what we could do better if faced with another crisis, and the results of such an inquiry must be made public. To facilitate a greater understanding of the United States’ response to the pandemic, the next administration must also declassify and release COVID-19 information that was inappropriately classified by the current president. There can be no coverup. And if corruption or deliberate wrongdoing tainted this administration’s response to the pandemic, there must be accountability.

In the midst of this crisis, much is unknown. Will we get sick? Are our jobs secure? What will our communities look like when it is safe to return to some semblance of normal life? But where there is information that should be known — facts related to the science of the virus, our preparedness, and the impact of the outbreak — it is incumbent upon our leaders to inform the public.

What would such a player, and potentially his teammates, need to do next?

NBC’s Peter King posed the question this weekend to Dr. Anthony Fauci.

Canceling or postponing a game, Fauci said, could be required steps. Depending if one or more members of a team test positive, a two-week team quarantine may be necessary, too.

“Absolutely,” said Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It would be malpractice in medicine to put him on the field, absolutely.”

Fauci said it’s too early to predict whether NFL teams can safely commence their seasons four months from now, as scheduled. The country’s response to the disease, increased availability to testing and potential immunity from exposure all are expected to evolve between now and then.

But Fauci said the NFL must be willing not only to sideline a player who tests positive for COVID-19 but also take more drastic measures if more than one player does so.

“You got a problem there,” he said in an interview for King’s Football Morning in America column. “You know why? Because it is likely that if four of them are positive and they’ve been hanging around together, that the other ones that are negative are really positive. So I mean, if you have one outlier [only one player testing positive], I think you might get away.

“But once you wind up having a situation where it looks like it’s spread within a team, you got a real problem. You gotta shut it down.”

Fauci isn’t convinced the 2020 NFL season will need to be canceled or even necessarily postponed. Playing tackle football right now would be “impossible,” Fauci said — but by September, he speculates it could be “feasible” players who test negative could compete, either without fans or with a reduced number of fans attending, with at least 6 feet between them. Regular testing of players would be imperative, Fauci said, as would the production of many more rapid-response COVID-19 tests.

“Right now, it would be overwhelmingly piggish” to procure as many virus tests as the NFL would need for an uninterrupted season, Fauci said. “But by the end of August, we should have in place antigen testing. … You could test millions of people, millions.

“Given the country we have, such a rich country, I would be very surprised if we can’t do that.”

So what will decide whether, and in what fashion, the NFL plays in September?

Fauci said the unpredictable factors hinge largely on testing availability and how prevalent COVID-19 is come fall.

“It will be entirely dependent on the effectiveness with which we as a society respond to the inevitable outbreak that will occur,” he told King. “What is going to be the effectiveness of our response?

“In my mind, shame on us if we don’t have in place all of the mechanisms to prevent it from blowing up again. In other words, enough testing to test everybody that needs to be tested. Enough testing so that when someone gets infected, you could immediately do contact tracing and isolation to prevent the infection from going to a couple of infections to hundreds of infections. That’s how you control an outbreak.”

Editor, Health Impact News

There has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.

French medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the “germ theory” of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine Béchamp promoted a theory of “terrain,” or sometimes referred to as the “cellular theory.”

The following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:

An objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.

For example, Pasteur’s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.

But as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur’s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by Béchamp that the “terrian,” more commonly referred to today as the body’s “immune system,” is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.

The evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded “plagues” or “pandemics” in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.

Of course today’s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body’s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today’s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don’t provide the same profit. See:

But just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer’s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a “hygiene” protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow Béchamp’s theories by bolstering the body’s immune system with great success in treating disease.

One such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.

Dr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.

So what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?

85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths

by Dr. Brownstein

At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.

There are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.

As of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)

I first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.

In that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.

Finally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.

That post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.

The human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.

The initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.

Thankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted—though many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.

At my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.

In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.

However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.

To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.

To watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah

There Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra

I think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.

Folks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine’s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.

In the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.

If you don’t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.

A holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.

There is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.

As I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about—they kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.

Having them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.

This therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.

In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.

Final Thoughts:

Like most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.

Better times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.

To All Our Health,

The CDC study, expected to launch in June or July, will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies created when the immune system fights the coronavirus, said Dr. Michael Busch, director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute.

Busch is leading a preliminary version of the study - funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - that is testing the first 36,000 samples.

The CDC-funded portion, to be formally announced this week, will expand the scope and time frame, taking samples over 18 months to see how antibodies evolve over time, said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund.

Vitalant, a nonprofit that runs blood donation centers and tests samples, will lead the broader effort as well.

Researchers aim to publish results on a rolling basis, Nordlund said.

Antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it.

The CDC study should also help scientists better understand whether the immune response to COVID wanes over time.

The novel coronavirus has infected around 1.5 million people in the United States and killed nearly 90,000, according to a Reuters tally.

The CDC study will test blood from 1,000 donors in each of the 25 metro areas monthly, for 12 months. Researchers will then test blood from another 25,000 donors at the 18-month mark. Samples will come from “regular, altruistic people” who come in to donate blood, Busch said.

‘FEELING EXPOSED’

Some public health officials have complained that the CDC has lagged on research and guidance for local governments trying to cope with the pandemic. “We’re feeling exposed at the local level, in terms of not seeing that kind of organized plan from CDC,” Dr. Matt Willis, public health officer for Marin County, California, said in an interview last week.

News of the study brought Willis some reassurance. “Partial answers and preliminary results are better than nothing when you have a decision to make” that could affect lives, he said, like when to reopen parks and businesses.

The CDC’s Nordlund said the study “is indicative of how leaders across the federal government are working collaboratively with partners in academia and in blood donation and testing industries” to monitor COVID-19.

She added that blood donor results can be used by CDC to form estimates about the broader population through statistical methods. “This has been done with West Nile virus, Zika, and other emerging infectious diseases,” she said.

The six metropolitan areas being surveyed in the precursor study are New York, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis, said Dr. Graham Simmons, another Vitalant researcher involved in the project. “In all likelihood” the next phase will add Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and others, Simmons said.

“We have selected sites to give a broad geographical distribution throughout the country,” Simmons said, including sites with high infection rates or places where rates may increase.

Researchers at John Hopkins University, in a 2019 paper, found blood donors, who are disproportionately healthy, are not always ideal populations for research. (bit.ly/2LDtz910)

The CDC study may not “generate results that are generalizable to the population,” Thomas McDade, a researcher at Northwestern University, said in an interview.

Still, it could “substantially add to our understanding of (COVID-19) infections,” said Dr. Susan Philip, deputy health officer at the San Francisco Department of Public Health.

“It will be a large sample size, geographically diverse … and quick to set up,” Philip added.

Some local governments have done their own seroprevalence research. New York in April found antibodies in more than 20% of some 3,000 test subjects, suggesting the number of residents exposed to the virus in the hardest-hit state is much higher than the 355,000 who have tested positive.

Last week, an antibody study by the city of Boston and Massachusetts General Hospital found 10% of the population had COVID-19 antibodies. The Spanish government ran a study showing exposure in 5% of people - suggesting 10 times the number of confirmed positive cases.",real

Emergency authorization does not mean that the drug is FDA-approved, a standard that only comes after a detailed review showing that a drug can safely and effectively treat a particular disease. The agency can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for unapproved medical products that may help treat a life-threatening disease when no approved alternatives are available, and that’s what it did here.

We need final data from clinical trials included in an FDA application to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating or preventing #COVID19. — Dr. Janet Woodcock (@DrWoodcockFDA) May 1, 2020

The authorization does not mean the drug was proven to work by the FDA’s usual benchmarks but that “the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” according to the agency’s authorization letter.

Under the authorization, the drug can be used to treat patients who are hospitalized with a severe enough case of the disease that they need to be given supplemental oxygen or placed on a ventilator.

Pharmaceutical company Gilead, which makes remdesivir, previously announced that it plans to give away its entire existing supply of the drug — enough to treat over 140,000 patients. Gilead said in a press release that the US government will be in charge of distributing remdesivir to hospitals, but it is still unclear when the company will start to ship the drug under the new authorization.

Research showing that remdesivir blocks the activity of the novel coronavirus in cells made it a leading candidate to treat it. Gilead originally developed the drug to treat Ebola. Prior to this authorization, doctors could treat COVID-19 patients with remdesivir by enrolling them in clinical trials or making individual requests to the drug company under the FDA’s compassionate use policy.

Data from clinical trials of the drug has been mixed. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said this week that patients in its study who were treated with remdesivir recovered from COVID-19 four days faster than patients who were given a placebo. Eight percent of the group given the drug died, compared to 11 percent of the placebo group. The NIAID said it will release more detailed data on the study, which included over 1,000 patients, later on, leaving the findings difficult to critically analyze at this point.

Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, called the results “good news.” “What it has proven is a drug can block this virus,” he said in the White House this week. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had a more reserved take on the results. “Evolutionary, not revolutionary,” he tweeted.

Good, succinct take by @CarlosdelRio7. Evolutionary, not revolutionary. Remdesivir appears active, may help some patients. A beginning. We’ll need better drugs and ultimately a vaccine. But this could help if used appropriately, especially if we also have antibody drugs by Fall. https://t.co/gUt7M6AGpt — Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) April 29, 2020

However, a Chinese study also published the same day found that patients given the drug did not improve more quickly than patients who were treated with a placebo. “Unfortunately, our trial found that while safe and adequately tolerated, remdesivir did not provide significant benefits over placebo,” the lead investigator of the study, Bin Cao of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University in Beijing, told The New York Times.

Testing drugs is hard under normal circumstances and even more challenging during an active pandemic. The novel coronavirus is killing thousands of people every day, and people all around the world are desperate for answers — putting tremendous pressure on any new data and inflating any positive signal. No drug has proven to be a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19, and research into remdesivir and other treatment candidates continues.",real

Pregnancy can sometimes be an uncertain and stressful period in the best of circumstances. But during a pandemic, that anxiety can quickly multiply. Researchers are working quickly to learn more about what the new coronavirus — as well as its impact on our daily lives — means right now for people who are pregnant. And health care providers are game-planning with mothers about how to best manage care in light of growing limits on public contact.

Here's what we know so far.

Am I more at risk if I'm pregnant??

""The good news is that thus far there hasn't been any indication that pregnant women are more severely affected"" by the novel virus, says Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of the department of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory Healthcare and a senior author of a prepress review paper slated to publish in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

This comes as a welcome surprise, as the similar coronavirus that caused SARS had a much higher fatality rate for pregnant people (about 25%, according to the limited data available from the 2003 outbreak) than for the general population (about 10%).

The current, hopeful assessments of the new coronavirus are based in large part on a study published online last month in The Lancet of nine pregnant women in their third trimester in Wuhan, China, who had pneumonia caused by COVID-19. None of the women developed severe illness, and all of their babies were born healthy.

""According to the current evidence in China, the clinical performance of pregnant women with COVID-19 is consistent with that of ordinary adults,"" says Jie Qiao, director of the National Clinical Research Center of Obstetrics and Gynecology Disease in China, who was not involved in that study but authored a commentary about it in the same issue of The Lancet.

Jamieson notes, however, that ""we don't have very much evidence from this coronavirus."" And although the data from third-trimester pregnancies appeared reassuring, we don't yet know much about the first or second trimester during a COVID-19 illness. So Jamieson, Qiao and other experts are closely following the evolving data.

What extra precautions should I take while pregnant?

The immune system's efficacy dips during pregnancy, which places pregnant people at a higher risk for contracting many transmissible illnesses — whether foodborne or respiratory. ""They should be considered an at-risk group,"" Jamieson says.

Official recommendations during pregnancy are currently about the same as for the general population, including avoiding crowds, staying away from sick people, washing hands frequently and not touching the face.

Qiao takes these suggestions a step further, adding that she recommends avoiding public areas if possible — and wearing a face mask when out. And talk to your doctor about telemedicine, to avoid unnecessary visits to the office. ""Except important pregnancy checkups,"" she says, ""consulting [your] doctors online is recommended."" Many offices are already working to consolidate in-person appointments (for example, if someone is coming in for an ultrasound, a routine prenatal check might be added to the same visit).

In addition to personal steps, Jamieson notes that it is important to consider how such a widespread outbreak could strain the health system, leading to disruptions in normal care. To prepare for that, she says, she advises that pregnant people have their medical records on hand.

Neil Silverman, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, adds that hospitals are already ramping up to increase the capacity to care for pregnant women.

What kind of contingency planning should I do for delivery?

One big change that is already occurring in many labor and delivery wards is that they are limiting the number of visitors who can accompany anyone admitted for delivery — including through the postpartum stay. ""This has been, reasonably, upsetting,"" says Rachel Pilliod, an OB-GYN who teaches obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University. ""We understand that giving birth is more than a physiological process,"" she says, and many families have expectations about sharing the occasion in person.

She advises women who might deliver during the pandemic to ask their provider and the place where they intend to deliver about current rules on visitors. Typically the limit has been to one other healthy adult for the duration of the hospital stay.

Ahead of delivery, Jamieson advocates that ""every pregnant woman and her family should have a plan, which should include what would happen if she or an additional caregiver gets sick."" For example, if a partner becomes ill with COVID-19 and is trying to self-isolate, is there another caregiver who can step in to help care for a newborn and mother? And because the illness is riskier for older adults, if the other caregiver might have once meant a new grandparent, a younger adult might be a better backup if possible.

If I do get sick, how do I protect my newborn?

If you do get sick near your delivery date with confirmed or even suspected COVID-19, there are special precautions to be aware of. Though new mothers might not be at higher risk themselves, it is important to avoid passing the virus to a newborn.

Early research has not shown any evidence that the virus can be transmitted in utero, during delivery or through breast milk. But transmission can occur after birth when infants are in close contact with someone who has the illness.

This issue raises challenging decisions for families and health care providers. The practice of keeping a newborn in the same hospital room as the mother after birth (known as ""rooming-in"") has become popular in many U.S. hospitals. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends avoiding rooming-in for new mothers with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infections. The guidelines (as of publication) say these infants should be placed in isolation and themselves be treated as presumed coronavirus cases, being cared for by healthy caregivers and medical staff in protective garb. ""The main purpose is to avoid close contact with mothers, isolating respiratory tract transmission and possible infection,"" Qiao says.

Pilliod notes that in her practice, the CDC guidelines will be discussed with families so that they understand the risks and trade-offs of their care decisions. Healthy family members may have the choice to spend time with the newborns in isolation.

If an infant is taken to isolation directly after birth, the CDC recommends that ill women who would like to provide breast milk for their infant use a breast pump, being sure to practice good pumping hygiene. Direct breastfeeding could also be possible if the infected mother wears a mask, but it is not currently the CDC's first choice. ""It's a difficult decision, and I think the mother needs to be involved in the conversation about the risks,"" Jamieson says.

What else do I need to know if I get sick during pregnancy?

Research is underway, but there is not currently a definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Once these do emerge, it's a distinct possibility that they won't initially be approved for use during pregnancy and lactation. ""This is one of the big concerns,"" Jamieson says.

For now, says Silverman, it is important to ""be aware of the potential symptoms so [pregnant women] can call their health provider if they have any,"" which include fever, respiratory symptoms or possibly even diarrhea. Additionally, he notes, if they learn they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, they should monitor their own temperature and be especially aware of any respiratory symptoms. Their health care provider can advise best steps for care and testing.

Qiao notes that individuals should also be careful when selecting over-the-counter medications for treating symptoms, as many standard remedies should be avoided during pregnancy (including many cough and cold — as well as pain and fever — medicines).

With the large uptick in the number of cases of the novel virus, researchers are gathering more data about the disease's impact on pregnant people, fetuses and newborns. Synthesizing all of that information will likely take additional time, but it will eventually help better guide public health and health care recommendations.

In the meantime, the best offense remains a good defense. And that means pregnant people — and those around them — should follow the best current personal and social hygiene recommendations. ""We keep pregnant women and their newborns safer by keeping everyone around them healthy as well,"" Pilliod says. ""It takes a village to keep us all safe.""",real

Alex and Matt from the llama farm ""Pembrokeshire Llamas"" decided to try and do something positive after their business was shut down by the virus. They've taken one of their llamas 'Max' to visit people living in remote spots while they deliver food to people and cheer them up.

""Shopping in the old days was miserable, wasn't it? It's great fun these days,"" said one of the customers in the video filmed by the farm owners on May 6.

According to the couple, llama delivery is not only eco-friendly but is most of all a safe alternative for those at risk of catching the virus, if they went out of the valley to shop.

Llama delivers food supplies several times a week, which helps Max stay in shape.

Since mid-March he’s been told his business, Tonsor Barbershop, 3935 N. Pulaski Rd., was non-essential and should be closed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Now, somehow, golf courses are more important?

“I mean, the whole essential and non-essential thing bugs me because I’ve seen people in the media and people in government with new haircuts,” Santa said. “Why are their haircuts more important than that of grocery workers and nurses?”

On Tuesday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker unveiled a five-phased plan for reopening the state. It won’t be until the third phase — called “recovery” — that barbershops and salons will be able to reopen, with restrictions. A Chicago plan unveiled Friday by Mayor Lori Lightfoot has similar steps.

There isn’t a timetable for implementing Phase Three. It depends on how many COVID-19 patients are admitted to hospitals or need ICU beds; both numbers must be stable or declining.

“It doesn’t make sense to me that we have to stay on the sideline,” Santa said. “We’ve been trained in the highest levels of sanitation and sterilization.”

Most of his barbers wore gloves and masks before the pandemic forced his business to shutter, he said. It’s also an appointment-based shop, so he can limit how many people enter.

Barbers’ sole income relies on breaking social-distancing rules, and unlike restaurants or retail stores, barbers can’t pivot to delivery or curbside pick-ups.

Santa doesn’t minimize the threat of COVID-19 and believes it’s important to flatten the curve. But the absence of support from the state and federal government has triggered a bit of desperation.

Santa has applied for about five different loans and grants since mid-March, including the Small Business Association’s Paycheck Protection Program.

He has yet to receive any assistance.

“I’m a taxpayer,” Santa said. “I don’t understand why I’m not receiving any help.”

Self-employed workers like barbers typically don’t qualify for unemployment benefits because they don’t pay into unemployment insurance, but they are eligible for the PPP program.

To be approved for that program, Santa first had to file for regular unemployment to confirm he was eligible for nothing — which he did.

But he still can’t apply to the pandemic unemployment program until the portal opens on May 11 — almost two months after the first stay-at-home order was issued.

He’s hoping to get aid quickly so he can pay his May rent.

“It’s pretty stressful because I thought by now, I would’ve gotten some help.” Santa said.

Damon Dorsey, president of the American Barber Association, said COVID-19 hit barbershops across the country like a “tsunami.” It’s an industry filled with small neighborhood shops, and the lack of government help has created a level of anxiety never seen before, he said.

He would like to see shops open but under strict guidelines, such as appointment-based services only; mandatory masks and gloves for barbers and clients; and constant sanitization of shops.

“It would be great to have programs in place that could help barbers, but barbers aren’t seeing any of these benefits that are out there,” Dorsey said. “For example, none of our members received any support from the [Paycheck Protection Program].”

Dorsey said the loss of revenue have driven many barbers into the shadows and defying state orders.

Chris Turcios, owner of Headquarters Barber Studio, 3040 W. Irving Park Road, said he’s cut hair secretly since the stay-at-home order was issued. Some of those clandestine haircuts were police officers.

“I barely just got my stimulus check yesterday,” Turcios said Friday. “We are taking risks by doing these appointments, but I’m about to be three months behind on rent and have $2,000 in other bills.

“What else am I supposed to do?”

Turcios, who also has applied for government assistance, said he is now relying on crowdsourced funding to support him and his staff. He recently asked his 1,700 friends on Facebook to donate just $2.

Despite the uncertainty, Turcios has created a plan for when he is allowed to reopen. This includes moving barber stations farther away from each other, removing their waiting area and allowing only 10 people into the shop at a time.

“This is a scary moment, scary that I might have to close,” Turcios said. “Man, we just want to be able to provide for our families.”

The automaker isn’t yet offering a replacement date for the launch of the new electric vehicle, but it says that the production schedule isn’t currently affected. The new Hummer is due out in late 2021.

GM announced back in January that it was resurrecting the Hummer as a 1,000-horsepower electric truck under its GMC brand, and it teased it in a Super Bowl ad starring LeBron James. The vehicle line, which became synonymous with the excess of enormous gas-guzzling SUVs, was retired in 2010 as the automakers recovered from the financial crisis. The new EV version will be built at GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck factory, which the automaker is retrofitting to make electric and autonomous vehicles.

The new Hummer EV is just one of a slew of electric vehicles that GM is working on as part of a more than $20 billion push into the space. The company detailed that plan at its first “EV Day” in March.

Automakers around the world have delayed events and product launches, shut down factories, and even pivoted to making ventilators and other critical equipment as the novel coronavirus turned into a pandemic. The world’s biggest auto shows have also been canceled or postponed.",real

“There will literally blue everywhere,” said L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti in a briefing on Thursday night, who urged people to applaud those workers, many of whom are coming back or going to long shifts. “One voice, united as a city and community, we say thank you. You are the ones who are saving our lives.”

The effort came out of the UK, the #LightItBlue volunteer effort has been organized in the U.S. by a collective of leaders from the events and entertainment industry. It was a way visualize their appreciation for what is now millions of Americans on the frontline of the crisis.

“We’ve been so inspired over the past few weeks by the cheers of our neighbors around the world – and we wanted to bring this collective gratitude to an even bigger stage here in the U.S.,” said lead organizer of the movement, Joe Zenas, CEO at Thinkwell Group, a design and production agency.

“This is a heartfelt ‘thank you’ from those of us at home to those of us who are going to work each day to keep our country going,” Zenas said.

All activations were executed using existing resources in accordance with local stay-at-home mandates. After this Thursday’s kickoff, the #LightItBlue effort will continue weekly on Thursday nights across the U.S.

White House workers are terrified to go to work (with testing), but they still expect you to go (without testing)

CEA Chair Kevin Hassett Alex Wong/Getty Images

On Sunday, CBS News interviewed a struggling American about doing his job during the pandemic: ""It's scary to go to work,"" he said.

That struggling worker is Kevin Hassett, one of President Trump's top economic advisers. And that workplace is the White House.

A presidential valet has tested positive for COVID-19. So has the personal assistant to Ivanka Trump. So has Katie Miller, the press secretary to VP Mike Pence and wife of presidential advisor Stephen Miller. Three of the most important scientists coordinating the administration's pandemic response — Anthony Fauci, CDC head Robert Redfield, and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn — all just started self-isolating because of contact with people who tested positive.

The White House outbreak demonstrates the muddle of the administration's ""Reopen, Reopen, Reopen"" message. At every turn, President Trump and VP Pence exhort us to get back to work and shopping. The White House downplays the severity of the pandemic and fiddles with data to minimize death tolls. The president blithely says the disease will go away without a vaccine and orders meatpackers back to work even as the disease rages through their plants.

But the dissonance between what the White House is telling the rest of us to do and what it's doing for itself is shocking. The White House is urging us to get back to work, and not worry about the shortage of tests or the absence of a testing strategy. Meanwhile, Kevin Hassett is still scared even though the White House gets to test everyone who comes in, and test staff daily.

Why does the president expect the rest of us to happily get back to work without tests, when the White House itself —one of the most tested and tracked place on the planet — is a COVID-19 hot spot filled with people who are scared to come to work? — DP

It's not ""government lockdowns"" that are hurting our economy — it's the coronavirus

One unfortunate consequence of our hyper-politicized environment is that it occasionally blinds us to the truth.

Republicans are howling that ""government lockdowns"" favored by Democrats are killing our economy.

Democrats, meanwhile, are screaming that the Republicans' obsession with ""reopening the economy"" is going to get tens of thousands of Americans killed.

Both of these stories miss the point.

What's hurting our economy is not government regulations. It's the common-sense desire of many of us to reduce the risk that we will get or spread the coronavirus.

Responsible, informed Americans understand that it's risky to gather in big groups indoors in places like offices, restaurants, churches, planes, and arenas. Responsible, informed Americans, therefore, are avoiding gathering in these places — and, where possible, avoiding asking their employees, congregants, and customers to gather in them.

Responsible, informed Americans started doing this before the government asked or required them to.

And responsible, informed Americans will keep doing it after the government lifts restrictions, until they are persuaded that gathering indoors in groups is actually, once again, low risk.

Don't believe it?

Let's go to the charts.

The location-data company SafeGraph tracks and charts mobility data. SafeGraph's data shows that most people stopped shopping, traveling, eating and drinking out, and attending sporting events weeks before the government required them to.

In and around Atlanta, for example, movement plunged around the middle of March. Georgia's governor didn't lock down the state until April 2.

SafeGraph

Same story in Miami. Most people stopped going out around March 15. The state didn't lock down until April 1.

SafeGraph

In fact, the plunge in activity occurred around the same time for every major area that SafeGuard tracks, regardless of what the local government's requirements were.

SafeGraph

As the above chart also shows, in recent weeks, activity has been increasing again.

Here, too, however, it's not government ""reopenings"" that are leading to more activity. It's the confidence among citizens that it's less risky to go out.

This is visible in a chart of the New York area. New York's lockdown is still in place. And yet, as the infection and death counts drop, New Yorkers are slowly increasing their activity again.

SafeGraph

The Georgia chart above shows a similar pattern. The state began reopening at the end of April. Activity is increasing — and increasing modestly faster than it is in New York — but it is nowhere close to normal.

The message of these charts and other measures of regional activity and commerce is clear: Lockdowns are having a modest impact, but the main force that is depressing our economy is the desire of citizens and business owners not to catch or spread the coronavirus.

As one recent study put it:

""...the labor market slowdown was due primarily to a nationwide response to evolving epidemiological conditions... individual state policies and own epidemiologic situations have had a comparatively modest effect.""

To fix our economy, therefore, we should ignore the divisive battle cries of our two political teams and focus on what is actually causing the problem: the coronavirus. — HB

Pay attention to tomorrow's monumental Supreme Court case about Trump's tax records.

While we're preoccupied by the pandemic, the Supreme Court is tackling monumental cases that could radically reshape American government and weaken the separation of powers.

Last week, SCOTUS threw out the Bridgegate convictions, freeing governors and the president to ruthlessly punish enemies.

And on Tuesday the justices will hear arguments in a pair of cases that could effectively put the president above the law. The linked cases concern the records of Trump's bankers and accountants, which have been subpoenaed by both Congress and a New York state prosecutor pursuing a criminal case.

The president, who has never turned over his tax returns and has blocked every investigation of his convoluted finances, claims he doesn't have to supply the records to Congress because they have no legitimate legislative reason to ask for them — even though historically courts have ruled that Congress, an equal branch of government, has vast, essentially untrammeled power to gather documents in the course of its work.

The president also claims he doesn't have to comply with the New York prosecutor because the president can't even be investigated for a crime while in office. In a preliminary argument in this case, the president's lawyer said Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be investigated.

I'll bet you that this Supreme Court effectively rules in the president's favor in both cases, most likely by giving him an indirect win that delays any handover of documents until after the election, when it won't matter anyway.

If the President succeeds again in blocking inquiries, he will have prevented the public from learning anything about his finances and the potential corruption in them. He has also blocked any testimony by White House officials before Congress on any subject he cares about, shielding the federal government from any oversight and investigation.

And if Trump wins Tuesday, he may get the Supreme Court to validate a theory of power that makes the US President above criminal law, beyond investigation by Congress, and untouchable by the courts.

That's terrifying. — DP

Musk threatens to leave California because of its ""fascist"" coronavirus restrictions

FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks at an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai Reuters Tesla founder Elon Musk has been vocal about his opposition to governmental coronavirus restrictions, and most of his ire has been directed at Tesla's home state of California.

This weekend, as Insider's Graham Rapier reports, Musk let fly again, vowing to sue the county of Alameda and ""immediately leave"" California because of its refusal to let Tesla reopen its Fremont car factory. Today, he followed through on the first part of the threat and filed the lawsuit.

Meanwhile, a California assemblywoman tweeted her view of Musk's threat: ""F*ck Elon Musk.""

This fistfight reveals one of many structural weaknesses the US has in its fight against the coronavirus: Our federalist system allows states to compete to woo citizens and employers by offering different rules and tax incentives, but our open borders allow everyone to travel everywhere.

As Musk suggests, the restrictions in Nevada are far less onerous than those in California, so if Tesla's Fremont factory were located there, it could already be up and running.

Meanwhile, Californians who share the assemblywoman's view can rightly point out that, if Nevada's lax restrictions facilitate the spread of the coronavirus, freely traveling Nevadans might soon infect more cautious Californians again. — HB

Will the pandemic lead to companies renting less office space… or more?

The prevailing wisdom is that the pandemic will lead to a permanent kneecapping of the commercial office real-estate business as companies realize that many employees can and will want to work from home and downsize their office space.

As Insider's Charlie Wood reports, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt offers a different view. Schmidt predicts that the pandemic will lead companies to rent more office space as they retool their offices to support social distancing and, in so doing, lease more office space per person.

Which view do you think is right? Please reply to this email and let us know.

While you're thinking, we'll offer a third possibility: These two opposing forces will net out to have a minimal impact on the demand for office space. More employees will work at home, requiring less commercial office space, but employees who do work in the office will require more space per person. — HB

Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son’s day care center but not Atkins’ job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he’s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.

Even clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he’s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.

“It’s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,” Atkins says. “I just hope and pray for the best.”

What schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing

When will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations

The push to reboot the nation’s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can’t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they’re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids’ lives at risk.

Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state’s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.

Lack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.

“Child care is foundational to our nation’s ability to recover from this crisis,” Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis

COVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.

Already child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.

Now child care advocates argue the nation’s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.

Though in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Seventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.

“We don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,” says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.

It’s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group – and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.

Summer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched

Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.

Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.

School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn’t had even a single runny nose.

“Our parents need us. They don’t have family around. It’s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,” Perry-Grant says. “No one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn’t either.”

But Perry-Grant can’t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.

“This goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,” says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. “There are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.”

For Demetriss “Demi” DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.

Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she’d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.

So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.

“If I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. “Will I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?”

Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home

Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.

Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“Most states are talking about child care, but there’s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‘we’re open,’ but then you don’t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,” says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, “exacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.”

As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation’s patchwork child care system is staggering.

Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.

“Parents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,” says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.

Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who’s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.

“Our ‘new normal’ will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,” says Byrd, who’s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.

Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks

Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.

Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.

Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children’s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?

Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can’t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don’t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.

“Parents are being forced into this Catch-22,” says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. “They feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.”

Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?

Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she’s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.

“With the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,” she says. “Until the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.”

Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""

It’s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She’s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.

“I went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it’s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you’ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you’re mommy,” Nedd says.

Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son’s age don’t know how to socially distance.

“I don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn’t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,” Nedd says.

In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She’s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she’ll afford rent and utilities.

Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she’s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.

“I would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,” she says, “or, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.”",real

He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country’s laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn’t.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests – which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus – far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

Also on rt.com Shameful treatment of the elderly is further proof Sweden got its Covid-19 strategy all wrong

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don’t know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read “At least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.”

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account – least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian’s graph is a disclaimer reading: “Note: counting methods vary by country.”

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden’s decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium – well above Sweden in deaths per million – have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

Also on rt.com ‘Swedish model’ of no-lockdown response to Covid-19 ‘WORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS,’ its architect says

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. “I think herd immunity is a long way off,” tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn’t all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I’ll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is “worried” and “not reassured” by the Swedish government’s virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden’s “tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem… something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts” has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as “an ‘invisible enemy’… an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.”

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

Perhaps Kim would feel more comfortable in, er, I don’t know, South Korea? There, the government would know his exact whereabouts at all times via a compulsory app on his phone, and he would have to tell them the nature of his business everywhere he went. But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we’re spitballing…

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a “literally Hitler” strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people’s lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

475,1020,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-health-care-costs-medical-treatment/,2020-05-15,"After battling COVID-19, survivors may have to fight big medical bills","When Grace Thomas ran a high fever and had trouble breathing in March, she headed to the emergency room. With a history of asthma, the 26-year-old Denver resident was familiar with respiratory distress, but this was different.

Both the ER doctors and Thomas suspected COVID-19. Yet while Thomas was experiencing symptoms of the disease, including severe pain in her lungs, she didn't receive a test for the virus. The reason: Thomas was never officially admitted to the hospital, so she didn't qualify for one of the sought-after tests, which the hospital at the time was limiting to patients who had been admitted. Instead, Thomas was stabilized by ER staff and sent home to recover with a fistful of prescriptions.

Weeks later, Thomas is feeling much better, but is now dealing with a new problem — sorting through the bills from her ER visit to determine what she owes. The financial hit from her COVID-19 treatment is part of the impact of the coronavirus, which has not only infected about 1.4 million Americans but also left many with heavy medical bills.

And plenty of stress — it's often unclear who is on the hook for paying for coronavirus treatments. That's especially true for patients like Thomas, who weren't able to get tested for the disease when they initially sought medical care.

""I'm still sorting through everything and trying to figure out what might be covered under new COVID rules and how it's all going to work out,"" she said. ""This ER bill is pretty huge.""

Thomas said she got a ""not very well itemized"" statement from her in-network hospital, which shows about $1,200 in coinsurance charges for her ER treatment. Co-pays from prescriptions add another $200 to her costs. She expects she'll also owe a $500 co-payment for any ER visits, although she hasn't yet found the bill for that. And she wonders if she'll be on the hook for two telehealth follow-up doctor visits.

Treatment costs could top $20,000

Exactly what's covered by insurance for COVID-19 patients with out-of-pocket health care costs is a mystery to plenty of patients like Thomas. The patchwork of initiatives from the government and health insurance industry may create as much confusion as relief for consumers.

""I wish there were a federal law that said it was illegal to give a bill to a patient during all this,"" said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But it all depends on who is taking care of you.""

Costs for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may reach $20,000 per person, while individuals can expect to pay an average of at least $1,300 in out-of-pocket costs, according to a Kaiser analysis. Even patients who aren't hospitalized may still face pricey medical bills for outpatient treatments, testing and ER visits that don't end in hospital admission, health advocates said.

Fear of racking up heavy medical bills may be keeping at least some people from seeking COVID-19 treatment. About one in seven adults said they would avoid seeking medical care for a fever and dry cough due to concerns about costs, according to a recent study from Gallup and West Health.

""Broken"" system

Dozens of insurers, including Aetna, Cigna and Humana have waived some combination of co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for COVID-19 treatments including hospital stays, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. But these waivers vary in what they cover, and not all people with insurance may be eligible.

In many cases, these waivers apply to treatment from out-of-network providers — an important consideration for patients in hard-hit areas where it may be impossible to limit your options to in-network care. Bills for out-of-network services are often the cause of surprise medical expenses.

Before the outbreak, several members of Congress were working on ways to eliminate surprise billing. Now, several patient advocate groups are encouraging lawmakers to deal with the issue for all patients in the next stimulus bill.

The pandemic ""shines a bright light on just how broken our health system is,"" said Emily Holubowich, vice president of federal advocacy for the American Heart Association. Patients with heart disease are at much higher risk for serious complications from COVID-19 and, in turn, expensive medical bills.

Dr. Agus addresses concerns about U.S. reopening too soon amid coronavirus crisis

Some waivers took effect in late March while others start April 1. Some have waived cost-sharing for virtual doctor appointments by video or phone, yet other plans still require patients to meet their deductible before covering those consultations. Insurers also have varying definitions of what COVID-19 treatment actually means. (To find out your insurer's rules check this list or call directly.)

Pollitz of the Kaiser Family Foundation notes another important caveat: Even if you think you have insurance from one of the companies offering cost-sharing waivers, you may not be eligible. That's because most employer-sponsored plans are self-funded and set their own rules about coverage. Insurers simply administer the plans.

""You may be carrying a Blue Cross Blue Shield card in your pocket, but if your employer decides not to pay, you'll get hit,"" Pollitz said.

On the hook?

Thomas said she worries she'll be on the hook for the full amount of her cost-sharing for the treatment she received. That's because she visited the ER on March 24 and her insurer is waiving out-of-pocket costs only for COVID-19 treatments that began on April 1. She also expressed concern that, because she was never tested, she can't prove she was treated for COVID-19 even if it is possible to negotiate an exception on the date with her insurer.

Patient advocates say stories like Thomas's are just the beginning of what promises to be a flood of questions, complaints and appeals concerning COVID-19 coverage.

""It takes weeks for medical bills to show up, especially from out-of-network providers,"" explained Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.

With COVID-19, meanwhile, it may take even longer as hospitals wait to see how much they will receive from existing and future government stimulus packages and how much of that will be used for compensating out-of-network providers, Fox predicted.

Follow the bouncing bill

Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, passed in late March, hospitals that receive emergency funding are prohibited from billing patients for fees beyond their network reimbursement rate.

""But that will be difficult for patients to track,"" Pollitz predicted.

The Trump administration has mandated that all comprehensive health insurance plans must pay for 100% of the cost of coronavirus testing as well as the visit to the ER, doctor's office or urgent care center that may have led to that testing. Definitive as that sounds, however, there are gray areas.

Take 25-year-old Anna Davis Abel of Morgantown, West Virginia, who has lupus, an immune disease that may make her more susceptible to coronavirus complications. Tests for COVID-19 were scarce when she came down with similar symptoms in early March. Her doctor decided to first rule out other respiratory illnesses, testing her for the flu and other common viruses.

4/5 So now I have this bill for $537 for a single NOSE SWAB because @Aetna says the test required to be elligible for COVID19 testing is not covered under their promise to cover “COVID19 testing costs” pic.twitter.com/0bci5vVWkY — Anna Davis Abel (@AnnaDavisAbel) March 23, 2020

The tests found that Davis Abel in fact had the flu. During her recovery, she received a co-insurance bill for more than $500 for the test and the doctor visit. Davis Abel and her doctor both believe the test should be covered completely as a cost related to COVID-19 testing, an argument the doctor made in writing.

""I thought to myself, 'How on earth can this not be covered?'"" Davis Abel told CBS Moneywatch.

After some unsatisfactory calls to her insurer, She took her case to social media, where it was picked up by media outlets. Ultimately her insurer agreed to pay the full amount.

Said Davis Abel, ""I hope other people with COVID-19 bills don't have to fight this hard.""",real

Updated on Friday at 7:36 p.m. ET

Most of the nation's airlines are beginning to require passengers to wear face coverings or masks on flights to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Southwest and Alaska Airlines announced Friday they will join American, Delta, United, Frontier and JetBlue in taking the action amid growing pressure from Congress and their own employees.

Flight attendants having been calling on their airlines and the federal government to require face coverings or masks on passengers since the pandemic began, and in recent weeks, some Democratic lawmakers have been urging the same, ramping up pressure on the Trump administration and the airlines to do more to protect travelers and employees from COVID-19.

The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents employees of United, Alaska, Frontier and 17 other airlines, says at least 300 of its members have contracted COVID-19 and several flight attendants have died. The union continues to call on the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services to mandate face coverings be worn by all travelers on flights and in airports.

The FAA has said it expects airlines to follow CDC recommendations that everyone wear face coverings when in public, but the regulatory agency has stopped short of requiring them.

Some airlines already require crew members to wear masks, and in addition to now requiring passengers to do the same, some airlines are blocking out middle seats, spacing out passengers during boarding and taking other steps to ensure social distancing on flights. They've stepped up their cleaning and disinfecting of airplane cabins, as well.

JetBlue was the first U.S. airline to require passengers to wear face masks, starting next week. ""Wearing a face covering isn't about protecting yourself, it's about protecting those around you,"" said JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty. ""This is the new flying etiquette.""

United and several other airlines will provide masks to those passengers who do not have them.

Asked why his airline didn't act sooner when the flight attendants union had been calling for such step for over a month, United Airlines spokesman Josh Earnest said it was a supply chain issue.

""We did not want to be in a position in which we are diverting medical supplies that were badly needed for medical professionals,"" Earnest said. ""Now that there is more inventory, we have been able to work through our supply chain to ensure that we can provide our customers with masks on May 4,"" when the new requirement takes effect.

Earnest would not say if the airline will deny boarding to passengers who refuse to wear a mask.

""We will be providing masks to all of our customers"" to make it easy for them to comply, he said. ""We do have language in our contract of carriage that will be updated, so we're going to be real clear about what the requirements are.""

Earnest added that social norms are changing to the new coronavirus realities, ""and I think those changing norms will carry over into the social environment on board an aircraft.""

Delta will make masks mandatory on Monday, too. Frontier's requirement goes into effect May 8, and American will require passengers to wear masks as of May 11.",real
478,630,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/parenting/fertility/pandemic-adoption-india.html,2020-05-06,"An Adoption, a Pandemic and an Evacuation","
The little girl, her black curls tumbling over her eyes and her slight frame uncomfortably splayed out on the airplane seat, hid crayons in her armpits the entire flight. She was puzzled how they, like the new people called Mom and Dad sitting next to her, now belonged to her.
Her new parents, Seth and Meg Mosier, looked to each other. Were they doing things right? It was not their first emergency evacuation — they had escaped war and violence before — but it was their first on a one-way flight from India sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And certainly their first with a little girl they had just adopted as a deadly pandemic swirled around the world.
In 2008, Seth, an American diplomat, was ordered to evacuate from the embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, when the Russian military invaded. Meg drove a car filled with diplomats across the border and into the safety of Armenia. In 2011, the Arab Spring protests forced them to leave Egypt.
Yet here they were, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” with dozens of young missionaries in suits next to a child who kept stuffing crayons under her arms and who clung to Meg as if her life depended on it.
This was not the way the Mosiers had envisioned starting a family.Seth, 41, with a dirty blond crew cut and a perpetually earnest look on his face, and Meg, 42, with freckles, a short brunette bob and a determination to always stay positive, decided to settle down after they left Cairo. They tried to get pregnant for five years and then, after two rounds of in vitro fertilization that cost $27,000, they started the adoption process in the summer of 2018.
Instead of the excitement of doctor checkups and ultrasounds, they got reams of adoption red tape. They looked into adopting an American child, but the agency told them they may be seen as too old. They considered Georgia, but were nervous about the prevalence of developmental disorders in orphanages there. Eventually, they settled on India, which has an easier process than most countries.
After weeks of filling out monotonous paperwork, they were directed to an orphanage in Madurai, a city in southern India. The orphanage gave them a name: a little girl named Selvi.
Last December, when they had their first video chat with her, they struggled to hold her attention. Selvi was more interested in her caregiver than the strangers cooing at her through a screen 8,000 miles away.
Less than three months later, the first coronavirus case in Delhi was announced on March 2, a day before the adoption was approved. Countries around the world started closing their borders to stem the virus’ spread; and the Mosiers thought their opportunity to build a family was disappearing.
They booked tickets to Madurai for March 12, four days before their meeting with Selvi. Madurai is an ancient city crammed with rickshaws, street hawkers and low-slung buildings, punctuated by its famous giant Hindu temples. They did some sightseeing, to get a sense of Selvi’s home, but couldn’t shake their anxiety.
“We were all nerves,” Seth said. “All we wanted was for her to like us, but we worried she would take one look at Meg and I and be terrified.”
Just 20 hours after the Mosiers arrived, India sealed its borders, canceling all unused visas and barring entry to foreigners. Indian news outlets reported that the government planned to suspend all international flights.
Now all they needed to do was meet their daughter and get out in time. They worried about being stranded for months in a country they barely knew during a global crisis. The bonding process was never going to be easy, but now they had to speed it up. The first day with Selvi, she clung to her caregiver, an orphanage employee assigned to raise her since she was an infant.
Meg sat on the floor with Selvi, second-guessing her every move. Was she captivating enough? Could she bond with the little girl the way the caregiver did? She had spent every moment leading up to the adoption thinking about the caregiver, waves of jealousy washing over her.
“But when I met her, all I felt was gratitude,” Meg said. “We missed out on those first two years of Selvi’s life. We wished it had been us who were her parents from the start, but we weren’t. Selvi had been in good hands.”
Every time the caregiver left the room, the little girl cried. When Selvi bumped her head on a stair and started wailing, Meg and Seth froze. The caregiver, who did not speak English, mimed a child being cradled to Seth and then darted out of the room while Seth tried to soothe the wriggling child.
“It was so scary. There was so much weight behind this, so many moments dedicated to thinking about this moment,” Meg said. “You want her to like you so badly, you want to just know what to do and how to do it, to do right by her.”
After 45 minutes of rocking, Selvi fell asleep on Seth’s shoulder.The next day, the Mosiers could finally take Selvi home. The orphanage staff planned an elaborate handover ceremony, stuffing Selvi into a giant, frilly blue dress with a fat pink bow. An overzealous photographer choreographed the moment, but only captured strained smiles and awkward formality. For his final shot, he had Meg hold Selvi, who started screaming and clawing for her caregiver.
“I felt so much empathy for her in that moment,” Meg said of the caregiver. “She had raised her for the first two years of her life.”
Through tears, Meg thanked the caregiver and promised to make her an important part of Selvi’s life. Today Meg and Seth show Selvi three photos to explain her transition: one of Selvi and the caregiver, one of the four of them together and one of their new, three-person family.
They flew several hours to Delhi on March 18. The next day, India announced that all flights in and out of the country would be canceled in three days. They had two days to finalize an international adoption.
The final paperwork — Selvi’s U.S. immigration visa and Indian medical forms — usually take a week. But bureaucrats from both countries rushed to finish it in two days before their window disappeared. Just hours before the airport closed, the Mosiers checked in and went through customs. But they had forgotten one crucial piece of paper: an exit stamp allowing Selvi to leave the country.
They were stuck in India with few hotels still open. Then the Indian government announced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. India’s 1.3 billion people were told not to leave their homes, except to buy food or medicine. The Indian police, always quick to use violence, have beaten civilians found on the streets, even stuck foreign tourists, trying to buy food.
The Mosiers checked themselves into a fancy hotel now empty of guests after massive evacuation efforts by various governments. The hotel felt deserted and sad, with only 10 of its nearly 500 rooms occupied. The handful of toys they had brought began to look painfully thin as the days passed. The crayons would disappear into Selvi’s armpits. It’s not clear why she did this, but some orphans hide toys because they don’t have their own.
They spent the next nine days playing hide and go seek with bored bellhops and the hotel manager. Meg tried to teach Selvi a little bit of English: spoon, flower, bed.
“So many people told us we were the bright spot in their day. The staff were all sleeping at the hotel, scared — and hated being separated from their families. Selvi drew so much light to them,” Meg said.
The U.S. Embassy was flooded with requests from thousands of Americans wanting to leave India, but there was a holdup with the flights that dragged on for days. Finally, they got an email saying the Latter-day Saints had chartered a flight to evacuate their missionaries. They offered the unoccupied seats to the embassy, which offered them to the Mosiers.
At the embassy, the Mosiers and a few dozen missionaries — barely out of high school — waited for their flight. One of them, Sam McGuire, 18, told them that he had been adopted as an infant from an orphanage in the eastern city of Kolkata by Latter-day Saints living near Salt Lake City.
Sam had spent eight months in southern India and had started inquiring about his birth mother when the coronavirus outbreak cut short his mission.
“I was really happy when I saw them,” Sam said later, about the Mosiers, “to talk and share my experience with them.”
Sam said he often lies awake at night, thinking about how different his life would be if he had never been adopted. Would he be an auto-rickshaw driver? A farmhand?
“I know what my circumstances could have turned out to be, what happens in orphanages when children grow older. People don’t want them,” he said. He was struck by the Mosiers deep love for Selvi. “They will give her a life no others can,” he said.
Meeting the young missionary eased the Mosiers’ biggest worry: that Selvi might feel she never truly belonged with Seth and Meg, because they were a different race.
“Here was this kid, born in India, adopted by Mormon parents, who grew up in the U.S. and came back to see what happened to him, where his story began, 16 years before,” Seth said. “It made us feel like everything would be all right.”
Eventually everyone piled into buses to head to the airport. Sam grabbed his bag and looked up at the Mosiers. “Goodbye, kid,” he said to Selvi. “You’re going to have a great life.”
The Mosiers are now back in Bethesda, Md., where the governor has ordered an extended lockdown. They haven’t introduced Selvi to friends or family yet because of the lockdown, which they said was a blessing that allowed them to bond with their new daughter. Meals have been difficult. Selvi does not like American food and so Seth has been researching Indian curry recipes online.
“I’ve spent a lot of time perfecting a potato masala,” Seth said.And the crayons? Selvi now leaves them lying around the house. “She knows,” Meg said, “what’s ours is hers.”

It was expected to draw more than 40,000 fans, and some of those supporters were coming in from distant locales.

But due to concerns over the spread of the novel coronavirus, that celebration is on hold. And fans from abroad won’t be able to come to Chicago and be on the lakefront today for what would’ve been a key moment in the Fire rebuild.

“When I knew that MLS postponed the game, I knew the trip wasn’t going to happen, but it honestly took me two days to actually say the words ‘I’m going to cancel the trip,’” said Fire fan Michael Giacometti, who moved to England in 2015 and hasn’t been back to Chicago since. “I told everybody I feel deflated. It feels like a real gut punch. I need some time to get it through my head and come to terms with the fact that I’m not going to be able to make this trip because I’ve been looking forward to it since I booked it in December.”

Because of travel arrangements, Giacometti is instead looking to come back for the Sept. 26 match against Montreal, which for now is scheduled to be the home finale. Nobody knows for sure when the home opener will actually come, and how that will come about.

The Fire are still looking forward to the opener, but like everybody else, they can’t know when.

“There is a lot of excitement about our first match back at Soldier Field,” Fire president Nelson Rodríguez told the Sun-Times. “Fans from 35 states, from as close as Indiana to as far away as Hawaii, and 12 different countries, from the U.K. to New Zealand, purchased tickets for today. Everyone understands that current circumstances will keep us from celebrating this weekend, but our Homecoming will still be held. When that day comes, we will find ways to make it even more special for all Chicago and all Fire fans.”

For Giacometti, his trip indeed would’ve been a homecoming. He would have seen old friends, connected with new ones, and been able to judge firsthand the progress of the Fire. For friends and Craig Broughton of Edinburgh, Scotland, the trip would’ve been a chance to see the team in person, and also pay tribute to Wilson’s late wife.

In August, Wilson’s wife Siobhan died. Wilson said Siobhan always wanted him to see a Fire game in Chicago, so he decided to go with Broughton. Wilson was the best man at Broughton’s wedding, and the two picked the home opener as the game they wanted to see.

“We were buzzing to finally get to see the Fire live,” Broughton wrote via email. “We received personal video messages (from) players saying they were looking forward to meeting us. It was a dream come true.”

The coronavirus temporarily put those plans away, though they hope to rearrange the trip when they can.

“I’m gutted I’m not able to get that chance,” wrote Wilson, who’s been a Fire fan for eight years after reading about the club and its fans. “But health comes first.”",real

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

“From our perspective, this remains speculative,” Dr. Michael Ryan told reporters in Geneva. “We have not received any data or specific evidence from the U.S. government relating to the purported origin of the virus.”

He said WHO would be “very willing” to receive any such information the U.S. has.

The comments come as the Trump administration has denounced both China and the U.N. health agency for alleged missteps in handling the outbreak that first emerged in the city of Wuhan and has now infected millions and killed at least 239,000 people. Trump on Friday said WHO was “like the public relations agency for China.”

Ryan reiterated that the evidence and advice that the U.N. health agency has received suggest that the novel coronavirus is of natural origin, even if Pompeo and Trump have alleged evidence they have seen suggests it could be from the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab.

“If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared,” Ryan said. “But it’s difficult for WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that specific regard.”

On Sunday, Pompeo told ABC’s “This Week” program that there was “a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”

Ryan and Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead on the WHO emergencies program, put their focus on the hunt for the animal host that is believed to have relayed the coronavirus from bats. Such a determination could help drive public health policies, like advising people to keep away from some types of wildlife or livestock.

They said Chinese scientists continued to work with the world against the pandemic, and suggested such collaboration remained crucial — and that efforts to “investigate” possible wrongdoing by Chinese officials could derail such scientific cooperation.

“We need to understand that we can learn from Chinese scientists, we can learn from each other, we can exchange knowledge and we can find the answers together,” Ryan said. “If this is projected as aggressive investigation of wrongdoing, then I believe that’s much more difficult to deal with. That’s a political issue. That is not a science issue.”

“Science will find the answers,” he added. “The implications of those answers can be dealt with from a policy and political perspective.”

WHO heaped praise on China from early on in the outbreak.

On Jan. 30, moments before announcing that the coronavirus was a global health emergency, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China was “setting a new standard for outbreak response.” He praised the speed with which China detected the outbreak, sequenced the genome and shared that information with WHO. He said its ”commitment to transparency” was “beyond words.”

The joint team said at the time that it was not probing any allegations that China may have mishandled the outbreak.

501,1229,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/op-ed-amazon-should-disclose-coronavirus-deaths.html,2020-05-16,"Op-Ed: Amazon, it's time to disclose your coronavirus deaths","Grocery store workers and others stage a protest rally outside the Whole Foods Market, in the South End of Boston, to demand personal protective equipment, added benefits if needed and hazard pay, during the coronavirus pandemic on Apr. 7, 2020.

Our essential workers are dying.

Just this week, we learned of three more Amazon warehouse workers who have died due to Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths to seven. Unofficial tallies, mostly tracked by concerned Amazon employees who receive text message alerts whenever one of their colleagues catches the coronavirus, peg the total number of cases at 900 or more.

There could easily be more deaths and infections within Amazon's walls, but the company has declined to disclose the impact the pandemic has had on its employees. Instead, Amazon has only verified deaths when they're dug up by members of the media, leaving us with a fuzzy picture at best as to how dangerous this work actually is.

Amazon disagrees. In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on May 10, Amazon's operations boss David Clark said disclosing the number of ""isn't particularly useful,"" and instead said the focus should be on the rate of cases relative to the number of workers in a warehouse and the communities in which they live. Amazon hasn't disclosed that rate either.

Amazon should release the number of infections and deaths among its workforce, or, at the very least, figures that show the rate of the infections inside its warehouses.

Our notion of an ""essential worker"" has dramatically changed since the start of the pandemic. It's not just doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and members of the military. In the time of the coronavirus, the definition has expanded to include sanitation workers, grocery store clerks, food-delivery workers and warehouse workers who ship goods ordered online.

Over the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. We've asked them to show up to work amid a deadly pandemic that has already killed at least 86,000 people and affected at least 1.4 million in the U.S. They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day.

We're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is. We're asking them to choose between no paycheck and putting their lives at risk. We're asking them to do all this just to keep the basic standard of living we've become accustomed to humming as a virus ravages the country.

If Amazon disclosed its infection and death data, it would provide valuable insight not just to workers who need to make decisions about their paychecks and health, but also to employers grappling with the same issues as Amazon.

As other businesses slowly begin to open again across the country, they'll need all the help they can get to make sure they're protecting their workers and customers, just like the essential businesses who have been operating through the pandemic have done. There are lessons to learn, but those lessons become more difficult without the data.

Amazon's biggest rival in retail, Walmart, also has a slew of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, but has routinely declined to disclose its own data and faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one of its employees who died from the coronavirus. Other horror stories have cropped up in essential businesses from Tyson meat plants to grocery store chains like Costco and Kroger that are grappling with long lines and customers angry over social distancing rules.

Amazon has proven it can be a leader. For example, in October 2018, Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. But Amazon went further than just raising wages. It also said it would advocate to bring the federal minimum wage up to the same standard, and CEO Jeff Bezos dared other large employers to do the same.

""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" Bezos said in a statement at the time. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.""

Now it's time for Amazon to lead again. It's an icon of American industry, like General Electric and General Motors were decades ago. It's the company many businesses admire and look to for guidance. Through its innovation and relentless drive, Amazon has earned the burden of setting the standard for how business works in this country.

So far, Amazon has done a great job talking about the safety measures it has taken to protect its warehouse workers. It provides regular updates on its dedicated Covid-19 blog, which reads like a template for just about any large business grappling with how to safely operate during the pandemic. Face masks. Temperature checks. Social distancing. Hand sanitzer. Gloves. And so on. Amazon should be commended for moving as rapidly as it could to implement these changes throughout its sprawling logistics network. That's no small feat.

On top of that, Amazon said it plans to reinvest all of its profits this quarter -- an estimated $4 billion -- into its Covid-19 response. Hundreds of millions of dollars of that will go towards its own development of Covid-19 tests, a key to getting all of its employees safely back to work. It said it could spend $1 billion on testing alone this year. Compare that to the White House's response to the testing shortage.

Workers are scared, even as they do important work for pay that doesn't match up to the risk they're taking. Amazon has the opportunity to shine light on just how dangerous this work is by being the first major important to disclose its worker death and infection counts.

Hopefully others would then follow Amazon's lead.",real

503,1644,https://dcdirtylaundry.com/arkansas-almost-600-workers-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-another-tyson-plant/,2020-05-21,Arkansas: Almost 600 Workers Test Positive For Covid-19 At Another Tyson Plant,"SPRINGDALE, Ark. – (RELEASE) – Tyson Foods, Inc. announced today the results of facility-wide testing for COVID-19 at its Wilkesboro, North Carolina poultry facility.

Of the 2,244 team members and contractors who work at the facility and were tested, 570 tested positive, the majority of whom did not show any symptoms and otherwise would not have been identified. The total comprises 237 individuals who were tested by the Department of Health or when seeking care through their own health care providers and an additional 2,007 individuals who were tested onsite from May 6 to May 9. Team members who test positive receive paid leave and may return to work only when they have met the criteria established by both the CDC and Tyson.

The Wilkesboro facility is among an initial group of more than 30 production facilities in the United States where Tyson is rolling out advanced testing capabilities and enhanced care options on-site to team members in partnership with MATRIX MEDICAL, a leading medical clinical services company, and other partners. The company is prioritizing communities with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 and will assess additional needs based on significant risk factors and access to testing.

As it is doing at the Wilkesboro facility, Tyson will disclose verified test results at other plants to health and government officials, team members and stakeholders as part of its efforts to help affected communities where it operates better understand the coronavirus and the protective measures that can be taken to help prevent its spread.

“We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families, and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities,” said Tom Brower, Senior Vice President of Health and Safety for Tyson Foods. “We are using the most up-to-date data and resources to support our team members, and we are committed to ensuring they feel safe and secure when they come to work.”

Team members at Tyson’s Wilkesboro facility have access to daily clinical symptom screenings, nurse practitioners and enhanced education. AXIOM MEDICAL, a health care case management provider, will also track the symptoms of team members who test positive and provide additional care. Production has begun to ramp up at the facility, where operations were limited on May 14 to carry out additional deep cleaning.

Tyson has also put in place a host of protective steps that meet or exceed CDC and OSHA guidance for preventing COVID-19. These include symptom screenings for all team members before every shift, providing mandatory protective face masks to all team members, as well as a range of social distancing measures including physical barriers between workstations and in break rooms.

“Our team members are essential to helping to feed the nation, and their health and safety is always our first priority,” said Kevin Taylor, Complex Manager for Wilkesboro facility. “Disclosing our testing results will help better protect our team members and help provide the wider Wilkesboro community with the information it needs to stop the spread of the virus.”

Tyson Foods has increased short-term disability coverage to 90% of normal pay until June 30 to encourage team members to stay home when they are sick. The company also has doubled its “thank you” bonus for its frontline workers. Team members who cannot come to work because of illness or childcare issues related to COVID-19 will continue to qualify.

505,1525,https://www.rt.com/russia/489209-russia-covid-recovery-toll-rises/,2020-05-20,"For the first time, Russian coronavirus recoveries OUTNUMBER new diagnoses","After weeks of coronavirus crisis dread, things could finally be getting better. On Wednesday, Russia recorded its first day of more Covid-19 recoveries than new cases, and the prime minister now believes Russia has hit its peak.

According to official statistics published by the Russian government, 9,262 Covid-19 patients beat the virus in the last 24 hours, and 8,764 people were diagnosed. The latest daily number of recoveries is the highest on record, and the tally of newly confirmed cases represents the lowest increase since May 1.

The latest numbers are a positive trend, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin believes that Russia is reaching the peak of the burden placed on its healthcare system by the virus.

“The situation is gradually stabilizing, especially in Moscow, which was the first to face a new infection,” he said.

According to the prime minister, it is now possible for some parts of the country to start removing restrictive measures. Thus far, 14 of Russia’s 85 regions have already begun to ease restrictions.

“All relevant services and authorities in the regions must constantly keep the situation under control and prevent its deterioration, so that if necessary, they can respond immediately,” he explained.

Despite figures moving in the right direction, the situation might not be all rosy. On Wednesday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that he expects the death rate in May to be higher than in April.

“There are seriously ill people in hospitals, including in intensive care, for two to three weeks. On the one hand, this accumulating volume creates a great burden on the health system, and on the other hand [it] generates a high mortality rate, which will be significantly higher in May than in April,” he said.

In total, 308,705 cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Russia, with 85,392 patients recovering and 2,972 passing away. 1,726 (58%) of those deaths were in Moscow.

508,866,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21255777/doomsday-shelters-bunkers-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-19-conspiracy-theory,2020-05-13,The doomsday bunker market is thriving amid the coronavirus pandemic,"When the end came, it was just like Tom and Mary had imagined. Supply chains started to crumble. Millions of Americans lost their jobs. Grocery stores ran out of food. The nearly retired couple wasn’t going to wait for society to collapse. They hopped in their camper van and drove 19 hours to South Dakota. “To come here and experience it in person is like walking the Grand Canyon for the first time,” Tom says. But it’s not the Grand Canyon. It’s a doomsday bunker.

Tom and Mary are living at xPoint, an abandoned military facility-turned-survivalist community at the base of the Black Hills in Fall River County. Miles of plains stretch out in all directions, connected by 100 miles of private road. Along the skyline, steel doors tucked into grassy knolls indicate the openings to the bunkers. It looks like an abandoned ranch, which is more or less what it was until a real estate mogul purchased it for the price of $1.

The idea for Vivos, a global community of apocalypse bunkers, came to CEO Robert Vicino nearly four decades ago in a moment of inspiration that featured a “crystal clear” female voice in his head. It said, Robert, you need to build deep underground bunkers for people to survive something that is coming our way. He filed it away until 2008, (the year Obama was elected) when the time was finally right to start building.

Vivos has survival campuses in South Dakota, where Tom and Mary live, and Indiana. These are for the downmarket bunkers that cost roughly $35,000 each. Vivos Europe, in contrast, is marketed as “the ultimate life assurance solution for high net worth families.” Apartments there cost upwards of $2 million.

While Vivos has been profiled as a luxury bunker facility, Vicino says most of his customers are middle-class. He describes them as “well-educated, average people with a keen awareness of the current global events and a sense of responsibility knowing they must care for and protect their families during these potential epic and catastrophic times.” Based on the people I spoke to for this story, it seems they are also all polite, white, and Trump-supporting.

As COVID-19 brings the real estate market to a standstill, demand for doomsday bunkers is at an all-time high (or low since the structures are underground). The shelters were once signifiers of fringe prepper communities worried about the coming apocalypse. During the pandemic, they’ve become vacation homes. “People thought we were crazy because they never believed anything like this could happen,” says Vicino. “Now they’re seeing it. Everybody is a believer.”

Bunkers give people a sense of control, the feeling that they can fend for themselves. Their newfound popularity mirrors an overall trend toward more disaster preparedness where behaviors that used to seem paranoid, like stockpiling food, look normal (if inadvisable) in light of the ongoing pandemic.

But the trend also has a darker side: the sense that people need to protect themselves against the other. “The have-nots are going to go after the haves,” Vicino tells me. “They will knock on your door. And if you don’t have enough to give, it gets ugly.”

Vicino doesn’t specify who the “have-nots” are, but his language echoes a specific type of pandemic-induced tribalism that’s typical in parts of white America. Since March, Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that tracks discrimination incidents, has received almost 1,500 reports of verbal harassment and physical assault from the Asian American community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found that COVID-19 is hitting racial minority groups harder than it is white communities. African Americans, in particular, are being hospitalized and dying at disproportionately high rates. Yet, prepper communities tend to be predominantly white.

Vivos, for its part, says it has members from “all walks of life,” and emphasize an array of religious backgrounds. Dante Vicino, Robert’s son, says “there is the expected middle-age conservative demographic, but we have political moderates and liberals, too.”

Prior to the pandemic, Vicino wasn’t making money off Vivos. “My goal is not to get rich off of this. I already was rich,” he explains. When the novel coronavirus started to spread in the United States, however, inquiries about new bunkers began to climb. At xPoint, the facility in South Dakota, Vivos has sold more than 50 bunkers and still has 500 to go. “We’re selling almost one a day right now,” Robert tells me. Two weeks ago, he says he made more than a million dollars on a single Friday. The following Monday he made $500,000.

Vivos isn’t screening incoming members for the novel coronavirus. Vicino says the tests aren’t yet “valid,” and he trusts people to make their own decisions. “If they need to wear a mask, they wear a mask,” he says. “If they need rubber gloves, they’re wearing them. At the end of the day, it’s their bunker.”

“We had a lot of snake oil companies in the indoor air space before”

Some bunker companies have capitalized on coronavirus fears and begun marketing air filtration systems that can screen out COVID-19 particles. Rising S Company, a Texas-based disaster preparedness group, calls itself the leader in “nuclear, biological and chemical air filtration systems” and says it has the “experience needed to help stop the spread of this deadly virus.” Survival Condo, a luxury bunker maker, says it has a system that “can filter out pathogens like COVID-19.” Even Vivos says its shelters come with “air scrubbers to eliminate all pathogens and radioactive particles before entering the underground space.”

“We had a lot of snake oil companies in the indoor air space before,” says Jeffrey Siegel, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who specializes in air filtration systems. “Now we have orders of magnitude more of them making specific claims about COVID.”

Siegel says that while the filters might be effective for cleaning air that comes into the bunkers, they don’t address the major concerns about how the coronavirus is actually spread. “In terms of the COVID risk, I don’t worry about outside air at all,” he says. “I worry about indoor air, and I worry about being in the space with someone who is infected.”

Siegel also says that installing fancy air filters but not testing people who’ve traveled from big cities is foolish, if not downright dangerous. “If you’re addressing the airborne route and not addressing close contact, it’s silly. We shouldn’t even be talking about it,” he says. “If the bunkers are poorly ventilated, then they’re actually more hazardous from a disease point of view than a well-ventilated house that’s not doing anything to treat outdoor air.”

For Michael, Megan, and their two kids, the pandemic was the final push needed to move out to xPoint permanently. The family of four had been living in New Carlisle, Indiana — a town of under 2,000 people — but they wanted to be even more rural. Two years earlier, they’d purchased a bunker at xPoint. Now it was time to take the leap.

“It’s foolish for anybody to think you could depend on the government”

The decision dated back to 2012 when one of their daughters got in a terrible accident at the Indiana State Fair. She was run over by a truck and suffered a crushed pelvis and two broken arms as well as numerous internal injuries that required almost 20 surgeries to recover. The experience left Michael and Megan with the knowledge that they needed to learn to fend for themselves — anything could happen at any time. “If you look at Katrina, the flooding in Texas, governments can’t control the world,” Michael says. “After all the stuff unfolds and you see the YouTube videos, it’s foolish for anybody to think you could depend on the government.”

Now that they’re in South Dakota, their days are simple and satisfying. In the morning, Megan homeschools their two girls, while Michael begins working on the bunker. He’s building a wood floor over the concrete and putting in a plumbing and electrical system. In the afternoons, Megan and the girls tend to the vegetable garden. Soon, they’ll start canning their own food. The routine is reminiscent of Little House on the Prairie or that of a minimalist Instagram influencer, except with armored doors instead of linen curtains. “The whole experience of building the bunker and being out here is fun and exciting,” Megan says. “Every day is an adventure.”

While many Vivos customers are currently building out their bunkers, Tom and Mary are one of the only other couples living at xPoint permanently. They bought their shelter three years ago after reading Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse, which is popular among prepper communities. The book is a work of fiction; it tells the story of a global economic collapse where the United States becomes “gripped” in a “continual orgy of robbery, murder, looting, rape, and arson” where “hordes of refugees and looters pour out of the cities.” Tom says, “It opened my eyes to the level of vulnerability that most people have if something happens and food can’t be delivered to the store for whatever reason.”

When the couple found out about xPoint, they were intrigued but wanted to see what the community was like before committing. “It’s one thing to hide away in a hole in the ground and stay there for months, but there are some things I can’t do myself,” Tom says. “Community is going to be important because you’re going to need help.”

He decided to attend xFest, the Fourth of July festival Vivos holds to welcome prospective members. There, he found a group of like-minded individuals — mostly families and couples like himself and Mary — that he knew could form the basis of a survival network. He and Mary signed the paperwork, planning to use the bunker as a home base once they retired and began traveling across the United States.

But the pandemic shifted that timeline up considerably. In February, as cases began to grow in the US, Tom and Mary watched in horror as the signs of collapse that they’d read about in Patriots started to play out before their eyes. “We could look out the window and see people going about exhibiting behavior that was going to spread the virus like crazy,” Tom says.

Of course, they were more prepared than most, but they hadn’t anticipated situations like a toilet paper shortage. “Toilet paper is important to have, don’t get me wrong, but there were people loading up carts of toilet paper and don’t have food in their mouths,” Tom says.

“People will become predators”

The scarcity made Tom and Mary feel exposed, especially being so close to a big city. “We recognized that if we did have a full-on collapse of society as we know it, that we would be very vulnerable in our home west of Atlanta,” Tom says. They decided it was time to move.

Now, like Michael and Megan, they are living completely off the grid. XPoint has no power or electricity, and the closest town is 30 minutes away. To Tom and Mary, it’s heaven — no more blaring sirens or crowds of people. “We got here, and right away, we realized we had made it,” Tom says. “It was just this really great relief to know we were in a safe place and could manage ourselves.” He’s working on building out the bunker with everything it needs to become a livable home. Already, he’s created his own power system and has a solar array and a wind turbine. “I’m his helper,” Mary says. They don’t plan to go back to Georgia anytime soon.

While the pandemic prompted Tom and Mary to move out to their bunker and has brought in an influx of new clients, Robert Vicino is convinced it’s only the beginning. “It’s the ripple effect,” he tells me. “People will become predators.” Vicino paints a picture of looting and mayhem much like what’s described in Patriots. “The have-nots will go after the haves,” he says again. “There will be hell zones.”

If this happens, Vicino claims Vivos will be the ultimate safe zone. “I would hope that the seeds of the future society of America come through Vivos,” he says humbly. “It may sound prophetic, but it could happen.”",real
509,75,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/science/animals-coronavirus-vaccine.html,2020-03-14,These Lab Animals Will Help Fight Coronavirus,"
Among the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.
There are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.
But the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.
There are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.
No single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.
First, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a “weak positive” test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.
And even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn’t mean they get sick. “Most of them, they don’t care at all that they’re infected,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.
If an animal doesn’t get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.
The best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.
Dr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, “but developed a brain disease” in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.
This strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don’t keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice’s frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.
The hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.
Dr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.
They hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.
The advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.
“There’s a huge demand,” Dr. Lutz said, “not only in the United States, but globally.”Dr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.
“There’s never only one mouse model that we use.” For diabetes she said, “we have eight different models that we’ll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.”
Dr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.
He said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists “to sort of winnow down some of the candidates” for vaccines.
Dr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.
Inevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.
Dave O’Connor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.
Those results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. “This is not the movie ‘Contagion’ where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,” he said.
He added that, “We are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.”",real
512,1074,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oxford-university-monkey-trial-of-coronavirus-vaccine-shows-encouraging-results/,2020-05-15,Monkey trial of Oxford vaccine shows encouraging results,"The director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has said that no corners will be cut in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. But now, there's encouraging news about a potential vaccine that's now being tested on humans and monkeys.

NIH researchers in Montana tested the vaccine using six rhesus macaque monkeys. They said the monkeys that got the vaccine developed protective antibodies against the coronavirus.

But it's what happened next that's giving doctors hope. When they exposed the animals to coronavirus, the monkeys that weren't vaccinated developed pneumonia, a sign of COVID-19. But those that got the vaccine, and developed the protective antibodies, had no pneumonia and no virus in their lungs.

""Why isn't it enough to show that a vaccine elicits, say, an antibody response?"" asked CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook.

""We need to know that it protects the animal or the human from the infection,"" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who directs vaccine research at Vanderbilt University. ""And just having the antibody, if it doesn't work to prevent disease, it's not going to cut it.""

The vaccine used in the study is being developed by Oxford University. It relies on a cold virus that's been modified so it can't spread infection. The vaccine is packed with genetic material from the coronavirus — and once injected, it triggers an immune response, teaching the body to recognize and fight a future infection.

Oxford professor of human genetics Adrian Hill said that if it works, it has another important benefit. ""This is not a hugely difficult vaccine to make,"" he said. ""So large scale is feasible, we believe.""

A different study has shown that rhesus monkeys and humans have about 93% of their DNA in common. But researchers won't be celebrating until there's a vaccine that's safe and effective in people.",real

A 20-year veteran of the company described to Yahoo News her experience of returning to work on May 11 after taking a COVID-19 test four days prior. She hadn’t received the results by the time she arrived for her first day. Her temperature was taken on the way in, but she only gave verbal confirmation that she was not infected.

The worker, who asked not to be identified because employees at the plant were told to refrain from speaking to the media, was given two moveable plastic sheets on poles to provide a barrier between her and the workers next to her, and new protective equipment, including a face shield and a mask, which made the already grueling work even harder.

“The face shield is s***,” she told Yahoo News. “It fogs up and drips down my face.”

The Smithfield plant, one of 14 meat-processing facilities to reopen after outbreaks spread among the workforces, is under intense oversight from the CDC.

As COVID-19 ravages meatpacking plants throughout the country, beef and pork options are dwindling in grocery stores. Consumers are beginning to realize just how much of their meat consumption depends on a flawlessly executed assembly line of some 2,000 workers and a supply chain vulnerable to disruptions. Now, new internal reports from the government warn that some parts of the country may see meat shortages by the end of the month.

“Analysts suggest that meat supply chain disruptions could see 20 percent higher prices than last year and potential spot shortages of meat in certain markets by the end of May,” says an internal government senior leadership briefing slide dated May 12, and reviewed by Yahoo News.

The briefing, marked for official use only, was produced by the Departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A separate DHS document, dated May 13, says that while there won’t be general food shortages in the U.S., the country is likely to face shortfalls in some areas. “COVID-19 probably will reduce the variety of food available in the United States as certain food processing facilities close for days or weeks to mitigate COVID-19 spread,” the document says. “The food and agriculture workforce is especially vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 due to close working quarters and a lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).”

While some consumers are already being caught by surprise as the site of empty meat shelves at the grocery store, the government has had multiple warnings. For over a month, DHS, HHS and FEMA reports warned of breakdowns in the supply chain, ranging from outbreaks of infection among meat-processing workers, to shortages of chemicals and equipment needed at those facilities, according to more than a dozen daily updates reviewed by Yahoo News.

DHS, HSS and FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Those warnings came after an internal government briefing from the beginning of April, previously reported by Yahoo News, predicted possible food shortages, including for meat.

Since that time, at least a dozen meat plants owned by meat giants Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods, Cargill, USA Holdings and JBS have paused operations, though only two are still closed as of May 14. At least 213 meatpacking and processed food plants and nine farms have confirmed cases, and approximately 14,259 meatpacking workers have tested positive for COVID-19, with 65 deaths, according to the Food and Environment Reporting Network.",real

In the most severe cases of COVID-19 infection, patients need the assistance of ventilators to breathe, and there are widespread concerns that the US does not have enough ventilators to meet the coming demand.

Seattle-based Ventec is one of a handful of ventilator manufacturers in the US, according to NBC News, and already has ramped up its production. Ventec CEO Chris Kiple says the company is aiming to produce 1,000 machines per month (up from its usual 150 per month), in the next 90 days, and eventually, to produce 2,000 ventilators per month.

Ventec will rely on GM’s manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing to help build more ventilators more quickly. GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement that GM would “continue to explore ways to help in this time of crisis.”

Other automakers including Ford and Volkswagen also reportedly have contacted the White House to see how they could help with ventilator production. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla and SpaceX employees were “working on ventilators” and despite a tweet from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that the machines were definitely needed, Musk didn’t provide further details about when or where his companies would produce the machines.",real

The continent was the epicenter of the pandemic until cases skyrocketed in the United States.

Europe passed the two million mark on Saturday, meaning the continent now accounts for nearly two-fifths of the world’s confirmed cases.



New infections and deaths have fallen in the worst-stricken European countries. As summer approaches, lockdown measures have been relaxed, and Spain – the world’s fourth-worst affected country – will reopen for international tourism from July onwards, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Saturday. Greece, Portugal and Italy will all welcome visitors again next month, while France will open its borders with neighboring Switzerland and Germany.

Though a relaxation may be coming soon, visitors to these countries will still need to abide by social distancing rules, and in some cases, may have to quarantine themselves upon arrival.

While the disease originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, an explosion of cases in Italy, Spain, and France made Europe the coronavirus hotspot of the world from March onwards.

However, the United States then saw a skyrocketing rate of infection, and now accounts for more than 1.6 million cases. Brazil and Russia have also reported drastic rises in infections, with both countries now reporting more than 330,000 cases each.

In April, despite economic hardships triggered by the coronavirus pandemic the gold reserves accumulated by the Bank of Russia made it possible to prevent the ruble from tumbling significantly, while maintaining foreign exchange reserves at a record high.

Financial experts are convinced that investments in the precious metal will serve a double dividend, by not only channeling revenue to the Central Bank coffers, but also helping to sharply reduce the share of the US dollar in international settlements.

Going for the Gold

In the last five years, Russia has significantly boosted its gold reserves, with the current COVID-19 health crisis and its fallout for the global economy confirming the soundness of this strategy.

Notwithstanding currency interventions in support of the ruble, soaring prices for precious metals enabled the Bank of Russia to retain gold and foreign exchange reserves.

In March and April, the Central Bank spent $6.6 billion, selling off $250-$300 million a day, according to rbc. As a result, the ruble lost some 20 percent of its value – not as much as it could have given the fact that oil prices had shrunk almost threefold. According to the calculations of Gazprombank analysts, without foreign exchange interventions the dollar by the beginning of May would have been worth over 110 rubles.

In April, the value of the Russian central bank’s gold reserves grew by $6.244 billion, or 5.2 percent, reaching a value equivalent of over $126 billion, or 21.3 percent of the bank’s total reserves, according to figures released by the regulator.

Partly triggered by bullion’s growing worth as a stable store of value amid the global economic slump, the soaring gold stocks caused total reserves to grow by 0.45 percent in the month of April, reaching a total of $566 billion.

The past four months have witnessed Russian reserves overall growing a net 2.1 percent.

The Russian Central Bank’s international reserves, consisting of bullion, foreign currency reserves and special drawing rights assets, form a “rainy day” investment fund for the Russian government.

According to the World Gold Council (WGC), in 2018 Russia bought 274.3 tons of gold, in 2019 - 158.1, and so far in 2020 - 28 tons.

This week, gold has been trading at its highest since October 2012, at $1,764.55.

In global markets on 21 May, Gold eased 1 percent to $1,732.43 per ounce, while US gold futures shed 1.1 percent to $1,733.60 per ounce.

""Gold seems to have lost a little momentum since breaking above $1,750 and the rise in the dollar today doesn't seem to be helping,"" OANDA analyst Craig Erlam was cited as saying by Reuters.

Analysts are convinced this is not the limit, as precious metal is the most reliable investment tool in a crisis.

The developments come as investor confidence in US government bonds has been rapidly declining, with yields on the bonds stalling near all-time lows.

According to Treasury Department data cited by the outlet on 15 May, foreign investors sold a record amount of US Treasury bonds and notes for the month of March.

“It was a pretty large liquidation from a lot of the foreign accounts. And it makes a lot of sense because there was a lot of precautionary liquidation given all the uncertainty, especially in emerging market economies,” Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates analyst at TD Securities in New York was quoted as saying.

Foreigners were cited as selling $299.346 billion in Treasuries in March, a record high, compared with foreign buying of $4.885 billion in February.

In March, Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest sellers of Treasuries, with its holdings sinking to $159.1 billion, from $184.4 billion in February.

The Bank of Russia, which back in 2018 rapidly sold off the vast majority of its stash of US treasury bonds on the market, has slashed the remainder threefold - from $12.58 billion to $3.85 billion.

BoJo’s office ridiculed after suggesting people social distance ‘3 fridges’ apart,"No. 10 Downing Street’s Twitter account was brutally mocked after recommending UK citizens visualize household items such as beds, benches, fridges and chairs to help them stick to the two-meter Covid-19 social distancing rule.

The strict regulation has been a key feature of coronavirus-mitigating restrictions imposed by countries around the globe, including the UK. In what was perhaps an attempt to communicate the physical distancing rule in a more relatable way, the PM’s office tweeted on Friday: “Keep 2 metres apart when you go outside. That’s 1 bed; 2 benches; 3 fridges; 4 chairs.”

Keep 2 metres apart when you go outside. That’s:🔴 1 bed🔴 2 benches🔴 3 fridges🔴 4 chairs#StayAlert — UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) May 22, 2020

It’s safe to say the majority of the British public on social media were left either perplexed or incredibly amused – in some cases, both – by the peculiar comparisons. Many leapt on the suggestion to keep “3 fridges” apart, with one commenter asking: “Who owns 3 fridges that they can carry around with them?”

Others referenced PM Boris Johnson, who was accused of hiding in a giant fridge to avoid questions from the media while out on his 2019 general election campaign, with one commenter jokingly asking: “Are those fridges the small under-the-counter ones or the ones big enough for a man to hide in?”

There were even some rather morbid suggestions for alternative objects to use as measuring devices, such as “1 coffin.” Conversely, humorous pictures were also posted, seemingly to help people visualize Downing Street’s household items.

UK lockdown measures – including social distancing rules – have been in place since March 23, with rolling three-week reviews. Johnon’s administration is coming under increased pressure on the issue of primary schools reopening on June 1 – with teaching unions and local councils voicing their opposition to such a move.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Sohn/AP Michael Sohn/AP

Germany is backing away from a centralized digital contact tracing program it had been considering to combat the coronavirus, saying the effort will only work if people trust that their privacy is being respected.

German officials had planned to collect data from users' cellphones and store the data in a central repository. That approach would give health officials greater access to information that could help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But it troubled privacy advocates, who worry about a slippery slope if the government has access to so much personal information about citizens' interactions.

Over the weekend, governmental ministers reversed course, saying the country would move to a decentralized approach.

""This app should be voluntary, meet data protection standards and guarantee a high level of IT security,"" Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a statement, according to Reuters. ""The main epidemiological goal is to recognize and break chains of infection as soon as possible.""

Contact tracing works by identifying anyone that an infected individual has come into contact with, and then notifying people who might have been exposed. Apple and Google announced earlier this month they are creating a tracing system that uses cellphones' ability to detect nearby phones via Bluetooth.

Apple and Google are taking what is known as a decentralized approach, in which all the potentially identifying information is stored locally, on users' phones.

The centralized system originally preferred by German officials would have required Apple to change the settings on its phones to allow for the collection of information. Reuters, citing a ""senior government source,"" says Germany backtracked after Apple refused to make that change.

Earlier this month, hundreds of academics from around the world warned of the potential consequences of unchecked automatic contact tracing.

""We are concerned that some 'solutions' to the crisis may, via mission creep, result in systems which would allow unprecedented surveillance of society at large,"" said a letter signed by nearly 300 professors around the globe.

""Solutions which allow reconstructing invasive information about the population should be rejected,"" they wrote, warning that a state, the private sector or hackers could use that data to spy on citizens.

The European Parliament supports a decentralized approach, and it has cautioned that there is a ""potential risk of abuse"" if data is stored in a centralized database.

The Commerce Department said Tuesday that ground breakings plummeted 30.2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000. That is the lowest level since February 2015. Construction of single-family homes dropped 25.4% to an annual rate of 650,000.

No region was spared. Housing starts dropped 43.6% in the Northeast, 14.9% in the Midwest, 26% in the South and 43.4% in the West.

“The monumental decline in home construction activity in April was widely expected, but the decline is breathtaking nevertheless,” said Matthew Speakman, economist for the real estate firm Zillow. “”The monthly decline in housing starts was easily the largest on record.”

The lockdowns and travel restrictions designed to contain the pandemic have brought economic life to a near standstill. The unemployment rate is 14.7%, highest since the Great Depression.

Commerce reported a 8.1% drop in the completion of homes under construction, which means many are being left half built.

The construction slump is likely to continue. Building permits for new housing dropped 20.8% to an annual rate of 1.07 million.

Opposition parties have requested the phone of far-right leader and his son Carlos to probe into the allegations levelled by former justice minister Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro tried to interfere in federal police investigations.

A video of a cabinet meeting has been released on the order of Supreme Court justice in which the Brazilian President was seen using profane words to express his frustration at his inability to extract information from police. In the video, Bolsonaro can be heard vowing to change Cabinet ministers if it is needed to protect his family from the “farce”.

Moro, one of the most popular figures in Bolsonaro administration, resigned last month after the Brazilian President fired the federal police director-general without consulting the Justice Minister. He alleged that Bolsonaro openly demanded changes in key federal police positions, including agency’s chief.

The video was the latest blow to Bolsonaro’s popularity which has nosedived after the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has reported over 330,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases with more than 21,000 deaths related to the virus and is all set to topple Russia from the second position worldwide.

Over 5.2 million cases

According to the latest data of John Hopkins University, over 5.2 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed across the globe with over 338,000 deaths, overwhelming health care facilities worldwide. The United States, Russia, Brazil, and the UK are the worst-hit countries due to the pandemic with around 60 per cent of death toll reported from these four countries alone.

The numbers get more sombre for the US as it has reported over 1.6 million cases, almost one-third of the worldwide cases, and more than 96,000 deaths due to the infectious disease. Within the United States, New York has reported over one-fourth of the nationwide coronavirus cases and almost one-tenth of the worldwide cases.

Lightfoot refused to say what form that enforcement would take — not in a letter to religious leaders sent Thursday, and not in a follow-up conference call with reporters Friday.

It’s a politically perilous confrontation she is desperately trying to avoid by appealing to what she called the “better angels” of religious leaders and by confronting them with the cold, hard facts.

“We know that, when people are gathering, the risk goes up exponentially. And particularly, looking across the typical demographic of black churches in Chicago, it’s a lot of very faithful, but senior elders, many of whom have challenging underlying health conditions,” the mayor said.

Lightfoot noted 93% of Chicagoans who have died from the coronavirus have had underlying medical conditions.

“This is not playing Russian roulette. This is playing with a gun that’s fully loaded and cocked. It doesn’t make sense,” she said.

Lightfoot said she’s aware a “small handful” of churches have “advertised that they intend to hold services” Sunday in violation of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

She’s been in contact with all of them — by letter and by phone — to try to “engage them in a conversation rather than being in conflict.”

“We let them know what our expectation is. We’re hopeful that we will not have to take any kind of enforcement action. But if we have to, we will,” Lightfoot said.

Pressed on what form “enforcement action” might take, the mayor would only say there are “a number of tools that we have as a result of this pandemic.”

“My hope, as always, is that our better angels will prevail. That we’ll be able to educate people into compliance,” she said.

“I’d rather be in conversation than in conflict. That’s the hand that we’ve extended. ... I hope that they will come to us in the same spirit.”

In her “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to “stay the course” and continue holding virtual services rather than meeting in-person — where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.

“I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from noncompliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.

“Yes, limiting services and other important religious convenings — like funerals, baptisms, bat and bar mitzvahs, breaking fasts and weddings — is hard. But it remains every bit as important now as ever. ... This moment is very much about the cold reality of the facts ... how this virus is transmitted, and how ruthlessly it attacks.”

On Monday, Lightfoot had responded to Sunday services held the day before, in defiance of the order, by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.

“We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.

But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order.

Her letter invites religious leaders to join her in a “conversation” about “what a gradual reopening will look like for protection of faith workers and congregants.”

The conversation began Friday during a phone call with religious leaders and will continue with the creation of what Lightfoot called a “working group across the various faith traditions to really get granular” about ways churches, mosques and temples can reopen safely.

“Making sure that we’ve got real guidance on everything from cleaning to face coverings,” Lightfoot said. “Can you sing with a mask? That was really the kind of level of detail that these faith leaders are likely thinking about.”",real

He ordered governors to allow them to reopen immediately, and threatened to override them if they refuse.

“These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united,” Trump announced at the White House on Friday, adding that it’s “not right” that some states have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but mandated that houses of worship remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

RELATED: LIVE: TRUMP SAYS “HOUSES OF WORSHIP ARE ESSENTIAL”

Any governor that has a problem with this can call the president, but will not find understanding, Trump added. If the governors refuse to allow the houses of worship to reopen immediately, this very weekend, “I will override the governors,” he said.

Trump’s announcement comes amid reports that religious communities across several states with Democrat governors have complained they are not being allowed to reopen, even as every state has relaxed the coronavirus quarantines to at least some extent by now.

Both Catholics and Lutherans in Minnesota, for example, appealed to Governor Tim Walz this week to relax the lockdown and signaled they would begin congregating in defiance of his orders.

Lockdown-favoring governors have pointed to the fact that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had not issued guidelines for houses of worship, prompting Trump to order the CDC to do so on Friday.

The president’s critics reacted to the announcement by claiming more people will get the coronavirus and die as a result.

Trump took no questions from the media after making his announcement, but his statement was followed with a presentation by White House Coronavirus Task Force chief Dr. Deborah Birx, showing the downward trend of Covid-19 cases across the US with the exception of Chicago, Los Angeles and the Washington, DC area – all of which remain under lockdown orders.

As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.

NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers — Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center — are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows “mission-essential” personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.

NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how to deal with the pandemic

NASA’s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency’s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. “The health and safety of NASA’s workforce is the agency’s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,” a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.

But as more workers at JSC stay home, they’re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they’ll join three people already in orbit.

That launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn’t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country’s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.

Of course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don’t know that they’re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called “health stabilization,” according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it “will continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners” if needed.

In the meantime, Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.

All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine

Once this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.

However, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA’s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.

SpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company’s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX’s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company’s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.

Of course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe’s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.

It’s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

In a quarterly earnings release today, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the expenses will come from spending on personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning for facilities, “higher wages for hourly teams,” and expanding its own COVID-19 testing capabilities.

Many of the changes have been put in place already and came in response to pressure over treatment of workers during the pandemic. Amazon is under fire for its handling of employees who have publicly criticized working conditions; it fired six tech employees who took a sick day in protest of Amazon’s treatment of workers, and there has been backlash against the company for reportedly using a heat map to track Whole Foods stores that are at risk of unionizing.

Bezos’ note tries to make Amazon sound serious about “keeping employees safe,” telling shareholders to “take a seat” while the company ramps up this spending. “The best investment we can make is in the safety and well-being of our hundreds of thousands of employees,” Bezos writes.

One of the more interesting bits from Bezos’ statement was that Amazon has a team of current employees that are working to build “incremental testing capacity.” So far, the team has built a lab to pilot tests for its frontline employees, and it pledges to share any progress the team makes to the greater effort against COVID-19.

Amazon’s Q1 2020 performance fell in line with its guidance from late last year, with $4 billion in operating income. Its net sales were at $75.5 billion, which outpaced the growth that it expected last quarter. AWS, its cloud computing services, saw a huge increase year over year, bringing in $10.2 billion this quarter, which is up from $7.7 billion in the same quarter in 2019.

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, these numbers reveal that Amazon — at least so far — is rolling with the punches and keeping up with the unprecedented demand seen for orders around the globe. That it’s publicly pledging a tremendous amount of money toward COVID-19 efforts is notable as well. Although Amazon is on a hiring spree to keep up with demand — no doubt a good thing for people in need of work — it doesn’t overshadow the controversy surrounding its treatment of employees during this difficult time.",real

CVS is opening 14 more drive-thru sites in California where people can self-administer the nasal swab test for diagnosing active virus, even as more antibody tests — designed to detect past infections — come to consumers. The pharmacy chain promised more drive-thru sites by the end of May, aiming for 1,000 COVID-19 testing sites nationwide.

Exer Urgent Care is among those offering both swab and antibody tests at its 16 sites in the Los Angeles area as well.

Lab kits for home tests can be shipped directly to your home, then popped back into the mail.

Experts say much more testing is needed to understand how widespread the virus has become, to swiftly spot outbreaks, and then to isolate and contain them. That could help save lives — but consumers should proceed with caution.

Self-swab diagnostic

As of Friday, May 22, the self-swab diagnostic tests will be available by appointment at CVS stores in in Costa Mesa (1150 Baker St.), Eastvale (14220 Schleisman Road), Riverside (491 E. Alessandro Blvd.), Seal Beach (921 Pacific Coast Highway) and Yorba Linda (18080 Imperial Highway).

To get an appointment, folks must meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria — symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat; or asymptomatic people prioritized by health officials, such as frontline workers who may have been exposed to the virus.

People must register in advance at cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing. The company aims to have more than half of its test sites in vulnerable communities, as measured by poverty rates, access to transportation and housing density.

The self-swab tests will be processed by an independent third-party lab, with results available in about three days, officials said.

Cost? CVS will accept insurance at the drive-thru test sites, but, under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act approved by Congress, patients should not have any out-of-pocket costs with their insurance. Uninsured patients will be covered under a program funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.

Some physicians are leery about self-swab tests. Swabs must gather good samples to be accurate, and one doctor likened the swabbing process to a “brain biopsy” and fears people won’t self-swab as thoroughly as necessary. That could lead to negative test results in people who might be positive for COVID-19.

CVS officials said that, “According to the CDC, a self-administered nasal swab is similar to the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab in detecting coronavirus and has the benefit of being less invasive and easier to do.”

Team members inside stores and at pharmacy drive-thru windows will provide people with information on how to appropriately perform a self-swab, and will observe the process to ensure that it’s done properly, they said.

Blood tests

While diagnostic tests for active illness are becoming more available, blood tests — designed to find antibodies to past infections — are becoming more widely available as well.

LabCorp announced expanded access to its COVID-19 antibody test on May 5. People can get it via their doctors (in person or through a telemedicine program), and directly at www.LabCorp.com/antibody-testing, the company said.

Quest made antibody testing available to health care providers on April 21, and directly to consumers via QuestDirect on April 27.

Exer Urgent Care is offering antibody testing at 16 locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, Pasadena, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Rolling Hills Estates. It offers nasal swab tests as well.

“In this global pandemic, antibody testing is becoming critical in helping us understand how widespread the virus may be and integral to helping us move forward and getting people back to work,” said Brian Wilbur, chief medical officer, by email.

After being slow to approve diagnostic tests for COVID-19, the FDA swung in the other direction with serology tests, allowing a flood of questionable tests onto the market without the usual validation. The FDA has since tightened up its requirements.

Right now, people should be seeking reliable and accurate COVID-19 tests with authorization from the FDA, and screening, education and counseling on the results should be part of the testing process, Wilbur said.

Proceed with caution

Doctors caution about reading too much into the results of serology tests.

People with antibodies should not assume that they’re immune to the virus and can swing back into their old lives — there’s not enough evidence to suggest a change in behavior is appropriate, researchers say.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office — America’s watchdog — worries about the varying accuracy of even the tests that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

“Testing provides critical information for a variety of purposes, including medical care, policymaking, and business,” it said in a “spotlight” report released May 20.

Testing helps determine risk, illuminates the disease’s impact, identifies those who may have been exposed but showed no symptoms as well as those who recovered, and can guide treatment and resource allocation by showing precisely where infections are happening. That informs decisions on quarantine and isolation, and on public responses such as school closures and re-openings.

“Although widespread testing offers a number of opportunities, there are also challenges in implementation,” the GAO said. “The performance characteristics of some COVID-19 tests have raised concerns about test accuracy. In particular, available data suggest variability in the rates of false positive and false negative results. This uncertainty can complicate patient treatment and public health decisions.”

The novel coronavirus comes from a group of viruses that originate or spread in bats, and it’s still unclear what animal may have transmitted the disease to humans, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert in animal diseases that jump to humans, said Friday in a briefing with reporters.

The virus probably arrived in humans through contact with animals raised to supply food, though scientists have yet to determine which species, he said. Studies have shown that cats and ferrets are susceptible to COVID-19, and dogs to a lesser extent, he said, without specifying whether they can transmit the disease to people. It’s important to find out which animals can get infected to avoid creating a “reservoir” in another species, he said.

Questions about the origin of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the pandemic, have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump suggested it came from a laboratory in China. Germany most recently questioned the claim, made by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Der Spiegel reported. Intelligence services from five countries, including the U.S., were unable to confirm his statements, it said. Scientists who have studied the issue maintain that the virus originated in an animal, and probably entered the human population in November.

New mission

WHO scientists are considering a new mission to China to get more information about the virus’s animal origin, Maria van Kerkhove, one of the agency’s top epidemiologists, said at a press briefing Wednesday. Questions remain about whether the virus traveled directly from bats to people, or if other species were involved.

Pangolins, armored mammals that live in Asia, have been found to harbor versions of Sars-CoV-2 that are similar to those in people. The WHO wanted to conduct more animal investigations on an earlier mission to China, but the lockdown of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan made that impractical, Ben Embarek has said.

The first human cases were detected in and around Wuhan, and most of those people had contact with the animal market, though not all, Ben Embarek said.

Trump has doubled down on claims that the Chinese mistakenly released the virus from the laboratory as the outbreak in the U.S. has grown to become the world’s largest and deadliest. Chinese officials have said that the U.S. has no evidence to back up those claims and called the allegations a blame game.

626,800,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/study-finds-most-develop-antibodies-covid-19/,2020-05-12,Study Finds Most Develop Antibodies To COVID-19,"Chongqing Medical University China has found that nearly everyone who recovers from COVID-19 will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the patients were found to have had the immune cells within three weeks.

According to the recent research nearly everyone who becomes infected with this virus and goes on to recover will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the 285 patients developed both types of immune cells that fight this virus.

Globally antibody testing is being geared up in an attempt to see who has already had the virus and was able to develop some potential form of natural protection against reinfection from COVID-19. However, many questions remain around these antibodies such as whether everyone will develop them, what level is necessary to confer protection, and just how long the protection if any will last.

This study was designed to help answer one of those question and it “brings much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement widescale antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2,” wrote Dr Francis Collins on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Director's blog.

By this point just about everyone has heard about antibodies and knows that they are immune cells that the body develops in a unique response to a given pathogen, and if you have never had exposure to a virus or bacterium you will not develop antibodies to it. In response to most infections the body will start producing these specialized cells that will recognize and target an infection should it occur again, often it will neutralize the pathogen entirely.

Coronaviruses are much like those that cause the common cold, from what is known about other coronaviruses scientists are guessing that humans will develop antibodies against this novel version. Up until recently there was no knowing for sure until they were able to study patients.

In this study the blood of 258 patients was monitored for signs of immune cells; humans produce two types of antibodies Igm and IgG. The first is produced early after infection and these IgM antibodies provide a short burst of protection before fading away; 40% of the patients had produced IgM antibodies within the first week of infection, and after two weeks of observation 95% had developed detectable levels of IgM and were producing IgG antibodies that take longer to develop but have more potential for long term protection.

In a follow up study blood was collected from another 69 patients, and within 20 days all but two patients produced antibodies; those two patients were a related mother and daughter.

To determine how much protection these antibodies carry and for how long they confer immunity scientists will need to continue to study patients and follow them, perhaps even doing challenge experiments to expose them to the virus again to see if their antibodies will protect them from reinfections.

However, until enough time has passed for such studies to be completed these studies are indeed an encouraging sign that the human body is able to learn and develop defenses against COVID-19 after exposure. If this turns out to be the case humanity may be able to develop some form of herd immunity against COVID-19 that would help to keep possible future cases of this virus from reaching epidemic levels as are currently being experienced on a global scale.

“There’s still a way to go with both virus and antibody testing for COVID-19,” wrote Dr Collins. “But as this study and others begin to piece together the complex puzzle of antibody-mediated immunity, it will be possible to learn more about the human body’s response to SARS-CoV-2 and home in on our goal of achieving safe, effective, and sustained protection against this devastating disease.”",fake

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

629,1503,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-schools-europe-policy-conundrum/,2020-05-19,The dangers of going back to school after coronavirus,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

Facing what it says are losses of $10 million, Navy Pier Inc. says the loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program will cover expenses and the salaries of 147 employees, some who have been “sidelined” since the pier was shut down in March by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The federal loan will be used to cover all salaries, including that of Marilyn Kelly Gardner, the Navy Pier Inc. president and chief executive officer whose salary, bonus and other compensation totaled $541,051 in 2018, according to records filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

The company’s board of directors, which includes former Mayor Richard M. Daley’s daughter, spends more than $3 million a year on pay for Gardner and seven other top employees. That includes $419,204 for chief operating officer Brian Murphy, a former Chicago cop who was Daley’s deputy chief of staff, and $258,816 for vice president of operations Michael Degnan, the son of longtime Daley political adviser Timothy Degnan.

The pier’s payroll topped $15.4 million for 2018, the most recent data available.

The $2,489,500 loan “made it possible for us to resume work and payroll from some employees who had been sidelined prior to receiving the loan,” according to Navy Pier Inc. spokeswoman Payal Patel. “Unlike other similar cultural institutions sitting on public land in Chicago, the pier does not have an endowment nor does it receive any monetary support from any government entity. Ninety percent of Navy Pier’s revenue is realized through earned operating income, and the balance is generated through philanthropy.”

Navy Pier Inc. does get a big break on rent, though. It pays the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois just $1 a year to lease the pier, which is the state’s largest tourist attraction.

The PPP loans cover about 10 weeks of expenses and won’t have to be repaid as long as the companies don’t cut their workforces.

Illinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.

Navy Pier was long run by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, a government agency established by the city and the state to oversee the pier and also to operate McCormick Place. In 2011 as Daley was soon to leave City Hall, he agreed to a deal, approved by Illinois legislators, to allow the authority to lease the pier to the newly created Navy Pier Inc., run by Daley allies including his daughter Nora Daley Conroy.

Navy Pier’s operators, past and present, have a history of making deals with politically connected people and businesses, giving them lucrative contracts to operate restaurants and shops and other attractions that together lure 9 million visitors a year to the pier.

Who got those deals was public information when McPier ran Navy Pier. Now, the not-for-profit’s board says the public no longer is entitled to know the terms of those lucrative contracts.

The Better Government Association has sued for such access. Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas Allen threw out the suit, but the BGA has appealed to the Illinois Appellate Court.

In 2018, Navy Pier Inc. lost nearly $5.5 million, primarily because its revenue declined to $56.5 million from $65.3 million the previous year.

At the end of 2018, Navy Pier Inc. owed $57.9 million in bonds and construction loans. It’s required to pay slightly more than $3 million on those debts this year.

With Illinois residents still sheltering at home while non-essential businesses remain closed under orders from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, there’s no timetable for Navy Pier to reopen or to resume its weekly fireworks displays along the lakefront.

“We got to be open to the public as soon as this thing lifts,” according to a source familiar with Navy Pier’s operations, who says the hope is that the government money will allow that to happen.",real

I typically do not do that. I avoid going outside at all costs but its a little bit hard to keep myself locked up all day.

I do not go to any public places where people could be and just keep some sort of healthy habits in my daily routine.”

“Me personally, I’m an extrovert. I like to be around people, to talk to people. I love to talk to people so it’s been tough but I’ve been trying to identify that and be like I need to have discipline.”

“I think this is the first time I’ve left my house since probably two weeks. I think it’s important to keep practicing social distancing even when you are out. I’m trying to avoid visiting places and talking to other people. I’m sure my mental health has declined staying inside the last two weeks. It’s messing with my education. I haven’t been able to go to school in three weeks now.”

“I don’t even think things will really go back to normal, the way they were before this. It just changed the whole narrative for everything. It changed everything pretty much.”

“I work in the restaurant industry so we were kind of early on shut downs. I think everybody is a little nervous about what they are going to do to pay their bills, rent especially. We have zoom cocktail hours set up for later this evening to kind of bring everybody together and just say hi to each other.”

“The Sunday when Governor [J.B.] Pritzker announced restaurants and bars would be closing, that was a big moment for me where it’s like ok things are really going to change drastically and we all need to take the steps necessary to quell any further passing on of the virus to others. It’s boring but it’s not the worst thing in the world to have to stay in a little bit more.”

Joanna Griffin, Healthcare worker

“Unfortunately I have to come out to defeat the battle and help the team out as much as possible. This is part of being in healthcare. For the team that I’m working for they are understaffed right now but everyone is just really trying to be optimistic and do the first thing first, making sure we take care of the patients.”

“I’ve been doing about five days a week and I’ve been going by METRA. The perfect thing about this is there aren’t too many people on the train. It’s not too bad. I had my concerns making sure they are clean on the trains. METRA is very good about that. I have no concerns about that, I know they’ve definitely been doing their part of safety first.”

“I was bartending between those things and then I quit my bartending job to start a theater gig and then that got canceled because all theater is being canceled at the moment. I still have to pay rent.”

Some people are teaching english to people in China. There are a lot of remote teaching opportunities people have gotten into.”

“If I’m not working in theater I’m working in the service industry and both of those are demolished right now. So I don’t know when I’m going to make normal money again which is kind of scary. We just moved into this new, beautiful apartment.”

Most twitterati lambasted feminist writer Clementine Ford after she tweeted that COVID-19 ""isn't killing men fast enough"". She tweeted this bold thought to thousands of her followers, commenting on the story of a woman who had to abandon her lucrative job in favor of her husband, who could not handle full-time parenting, labeling the man ""absolutely pathetic"".

Despite not feeling for the hero of the story, netizens slammed Ford for being way too brutal, stressing that no mistakes or failures can excuse such things to say. Having received the wave of disproval, Ford only went on to remark how ""fragile"" men are if they react like that.

​Some noted that the tweet could be compared with racism, ableism and hate speech.

​Some pointed out that while Ford was apparently standing with women, she ended up insulting both genders.

This take makes no sense if you actually read the article which takes both men and women far more seriously than your callous response does. Imagine wishing single-motherhood on a woman in a time of Covid. The irony of this tweet is that it’s anti men AND women. — Chloé S. Valdary 📚 (@cvaldary) May 23, 2020

​Another sad irony of the incident is that several studies that have been conducted globally have shown that men tend to actually die from COVID-19 more often, although the potential to overcome the disease is the same for both genders. According to research by University College London, based on the data collected on 206,128 patients, men were twice as likely to require intensive care, and 60 percent more likely to die after being infected wIth COVID-19.

Facing strong backlash, Ford deleted the tweet, apologizing in a subsequent series of tweets for not ""framing her argument"" clearly and describing her tweet as ""poorly judged"". It was noted by many, however, that she remained committed to her assertion.",fake

Turner Sports says quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning will join them for a two-on-two match sometime in May. Missing from the announcement were such details as when and where the match would be played, except that tournament organizers would work with government and health officials to meet safety and health standards.

Turner said all donations and fundraising from “The Match: Champions for Charity” would benefit relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic.

The event will be televised on TNT, with social and digital content leading up and during the event available through Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.

“It’s on now,” Mickelson tweeted Wednesday afternoon responding to Bleacher Report.

He added that he would be paired with Brady, saying:

“After feeling the sting of defeat the first time around, Looks like @TigerWoods is bringing a ringer to The Match (#PeytonManning). I’m bringing a GOAT. @TomBrady — Ready to hit bombs?”

The first match over Thanksgiving weekend in November 2018 was supposed to be pay-per-view, except that technical difficulties allowed everyone to watch.

It lacked some of wild bets both players had teased, and the trash talking was forced at times. Mickelson ended up winning the $9 million winner-take-all purse in a wedge contest under the lights when the matched ended in a tie.

The network has traded coverage of the virus for stories on anti-lockdown protests and echoes of President Donald Trump's comments that stand in contrast to recommendations from leading experts in recent weeks.

Fox News has been criticized over the past two months for its coronavirus coverage that has included downplaying death totals and pushing back against social distancing guidelines even though its own employees are under a work-from-home order until at least June 15.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Fox News has cut its coronavirus coverage by more than 20% in recent weeks, according to data reported by Media Matters for America.

According to the conservative media research group, 95% of weekday segments aired on Fox from March 12 through April 10 were related to the novel coronavirus. But just a month later from April 13 through May 11, coronavirus-related coverage dropped to 74% of weekday segments, and by the middle of May, ""coronavirus-related weekday segments accounted for only 56% of all output from the network.""

The network's coronavirus coverage is significantly smaller when compared to that of CNN, which, according to the data since March 12, had 90% of all weekday coverage except for one feature coronavirus-related stories, according to Media Matters. For MSNBC, coronavirus-related coverage accounted for more than 80% of each day's programming in the same period, the report said.

Fox News initially sparked criticism by downplaying death totals and pushing back against social distancing guidelines in mid-March before on-air talent took a sharp pivot to more serious coverage of the novel coronavirus pandemic as outbreaks took hold of cities across the US through April.

However, on-air figures like host Tucker Carlson repeated calls for President Donald Trump to lift lockdown measures and open businesses across the country, apparently echoing comments by Trump that are in direct opposition to recommendations from leading experts as coronavirus cases steadily rose.

The remaining coverage on the network has focused less on scientific findings behind the pandemic, but instead on pushing stories on the political divide under existing lockdown measures and favorable looks at anti-lockdown protests, though Fox employees are under a work-from-home order through at least June 15.

In the first weeks of May, the network's shrinking coverage of coronavirus-related stories turned toward new revelations like the Department of Justice's attempt to drop the case against retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and its significance in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

As the death toll among Americans passed 84,000 in the second week of May, the network, alongside Trump's Twitter account, latched on to an ""OBAMAGATE"" scandal.

After Republican senators released a list of administration officials under former President Barack Obama who worked to unmask an American from intelligence reports who turned out to be Michael Flynn, Trump began tweeting harsh but vague allegations against Obama his former Vice President Joe Biden.

The collective push from Fox News and Trump's Twitter over the last week appears to be a narrative related to the decision in 2017 to publicly reveal Flynn's identity and aimed at eroding Obama's significance ahead of the 2020 presidential election.",real

J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday that 177 public sites are now offering free coronavirus testing across the state, with 65 new locations added since Pritzker reported last week that Illinois had reached the elusive goal of processing 10,000 tests in a single day.

Since hitting that mark last Friday, Illinois has run 96,551 total tests and hasn’t once dipped below that daily benchmark. The tests conducted over the past seven days account for more than 35% of the tests the state has conducted since reporting began in early March.

With his modified stay-at-home taking effect on Friday, Pritzker made it clear that testing for the deadly virus is “vital to our efforts to reduce social restrictions, get our economy going and to protect our residents.”

A drive-thru site at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park is among the new testing locations that have recently opened in minority communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Jose Sanchez, the hospital’s president and CEO, announced Thursday that over 80% of those tested since the site opened Tuesday have been Latino or African American.

Speaking to reporters at the governor’s daily press briefing, Sanchez said the new testing site helps “address the serious health inequities we have seen in our community.” The Sun-Times reported Thursday that the Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.

“It is critical that we identify the individuals that have COVID-19 early so we can provide interventions and prevent the spread of virus in our underserved communities,” added Sanchez, who said the hospital is expected to run “hundreds” of COVID-19 tests by the end of the week.

In addition to the substantial increase in community testing sites like Norwegian, Pritzker announced that new drive-thru sites operated by the state will open next week in Waukegan and East St. Louis. Once those get up-and-running, Pritzker set a goal of collecting a total of 3,000 daily swabs at those seven sites.

As more tests have been processed, a lower rate have started to come back positive. Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike attributed that decrease to the state’s expanded criteria for testing, which had initially been limited to those considered at high risk of contracting the disease.

Casting a wider net is vital for getting a better sense of the true rate of infection. In South Korea, a country of 51 million that acted swiftly to institute an aggressive testing system, the positivity rate has hovered around 3%. Meanwhile, the rate of positive tests in Illinois has fallen to around 20%.

“We will have that lower positivity rate, but be grateful for the ones that we identify,” Ezike said.

While Pritzker said the state has taken considerable steps to address the shortage of supplies needed to run tests — including striking a deal with the White House to obtain hundreds of thousands of swabs and vials of the solution needed to transport them — he made it clear that the country “just doesn’t produce enough of these raw materials to meet the medical need.”

“Our procurement teams have been hard at work competing for those raw materials against every nation and every state in the open market,” Pritzker said. “And so far, we’re succeeding.”",real

One mill in upstate New York is operating 18 hours a day to keep up, but barely has enough bags to package flour with.

The supply chain hasn't quite kept up with the shift in demand, which might be why flour is still missing from grocery store shelves.

View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.

These days it seems like everyone has picked up baking as a quarantine hobby.

That is, if you can find the necessary ingredients. Consumers across the country have reported a lack of yeast and flour at supermarkets since the pandemic started.

But flour producers are telling another story: that they aren't in danger of running out.

""There's not a flour shortage,"" flour miller Thor Oechsner told Business Insider Today. ""The mills are running. We can't get it packaged quick enough to get it out, the way that demand has flipped.""

Oechsner is the co-owner of Farmer Ground Flour, a small company from Trumansburg, New York, that sells mostly wholesale to bakeries and food co-ops. Now, it has lost many of those orders, but demand from individual consumers and supermarkets is higher than ever.

And that means changing how the flour is packaged — which is the real challenge for him.

""Our mill is set up to pretty efficiently build 25- and 50-pound bags going wholesale to bakeries. We are not super well set up to do 2-pound bags. I mean we can do them, but not at this quantity,"" he said.

Since the flour is packaged manually, it is more time-consuming to fill smaller bags.

""For the first three weeks of the whole COVID-19 thing, we got more orders for 2-pound cases than we get normally in almost a year. So it's just this exponential explosion, these 2-pound bags,"" Oechsner said.

The packaging challenges may explain why some consumers are seeing flour sold in unmarked bags or large quantities.

Meanwhile, the shift in demand means flour mills are working overtime. The mill that Oechsner co-owns is operating 18 hours a day. It's also impacting the supply chain, making it hard for flour producers to get the supplies they need.

But Oechsner says he still doesn't know if the increase in demand is enough to make up for the wholesale orders he's lost.

""I think at this point everybody at the mill is so hunkered down trying to fill these orders that nobody exactly knows how this is shaking out financially, just because it's seriously all hands on deck to try to get, you know, even come close to filling these orders,"" he said.",real
695,627,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/05/challenges-and-a-coronavirus-vaccine/,2020-05-06,Challenges and a Coronavirus Vaccine,"President Trump recently announced “Operation Warp Speed,” a plan for a novel coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020. I welcome the announcement because the greatest impediment to a vaccine now is the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval process. Speedy development of a vaccine is not without precedent.

The President’s comparison to the Manhattan Project, however, seems excessive. A vaccine is knowledge, which we may already possess. At least three candidate vaccines are in human safety testing, with perhaps thirty more in development. We hopefully have the recipe for an effective vaccine.

The FDA vaccine approval process starts with animal testing to evaluate safety and the production of antibodies followed by three phases of human testing. First is a very small sample to test safety; vaccines sometimes induce immune system reactions which damage organs. If judged safe, two rounds of randomized control trials ensue involving hundreds and then thousands of participants.

Only a safe and effective vaccine will benefit Americans. A vaccine will likely be part of returning life to normal. An ineffective vaccine may unleash another COVID outbreak and thousands of deaths.

Can this be accomplished quickly? Dr. Anthony Fauci has repeatedly stated that developing a vaccine will take 12 to 18 months; other experts suggest years. History shows otherwise, at least in one case. In 1957, a new strain of influenza, the Asian flu, was detected in Hong Kong in April. Dr. Maurice Hilleman, chief of respiratory diseases at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, wanted a vaccine ready before it reached the U.S. When the flu arrived four months later, forty million Americans had been inoculated. The pandemic claimed 70,000 American lives, but the total likely would have been much higher without a vaccine.

Dr. Hilleman devised both an effective vaccine and a plan for manufacturing it. In devising his plan, according to History.com, Dr. Hilleman “bypassed regulatory agencies in his efforts to push the vaccine forward because he worried those agencies would slow the process down.”

How could we expedite the process today? I am not a medical researcher, but we could probably combine the two phases of effectiveness testing and test several candidates with a common control group. We could also employ human challenge testing and deliberately infect participants with the virus. We would administer participants a vaccine, give their immune systems time to develop antibodies, and then infect them with the coronavirus. Trials normally rely on participants running into a virus during their daily routines.

Human challenge testing offers several advantages. A trial would require fewer participants since all get exposed. The test concludes faster as exposure occurs immediately after the vaccine has had a chance to work. And researchers can control the exact exposure.

A significant ethical issue arises, as control group participants receive a placebo. Medical researchers would be intentionally infecting unprotected people with a deadly virus.

A paper in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, however, argues that human challenge testing could be ethical. We could include only young adults with no known risk factors, who face a low risk of death from COVID-19, provide them with the best healthcare available if needed, and seriously test informed consent.

A moral society is based on voluntary interaction. Consent distinguishes gifts from theft and democracy from dictatorship. I believe that informed consent justifies deliberate exposure to the coronavirus. History sadly provides examples of despicable, unethical medical experiments, like the Tuskegee Experiment. We will not be doing anything remotely similar here.

As an economist, I would further suggest compensating participants with fame if not money. Any participants who unfortunately die in the testing should know that we will commemorate their lives and sacrifice in the COVID pandemic museum.

Operation Warp Speed has let Americans know that we can guide the process of vaccine testing, not bureaucratic rules. Let’s now devise an expedited process to get an effective vaccine to Americans as soon as possible.",fake

Why would they be destroying food at a time when grocery stores and food pantries struggle to keep pace with surging demand during the coronavirus pandemic?

Opinion

As sociologists with a specialty in agriculture and food, we study how the structure of the food system affects people’s lives and the environment. Seeing food destroyed at a time when people are going hungry highlights both short- and long-term problems with this system.

A tale of two supply chains

Surprisingly, the supply chain for food bears a striking similarity to that of another product that has experienced shortages: toilet paper.

Like the toilet paper market, the food industry has two separate supply chains for consumer and commercial use. On the consumer side are grocery and convenience stores that focus on small purchases. The commercial side represents restaurants and institutions such as schools, prisons, hospitals and corporate cafeterias that purchase large quantities of foods in bulk.

Ultimately, commercial institutions purchase in sizes that exceed the storage capacity of most households and food pantries.

While the commercial and the consumer supply chains are different, there are some commonalities: Both are complex, cover long distances and rely on just-in-time production. Both are also increasingly concentrated, meaning that there are only a few companies between farmers and consumers that process and distribute raw agricultural goods into edible food.

For example, on the commercial side, Sysco and U.S. Foods control an estimated 75% of the market for food distribution.

These characteristics make the supply chains more vulnerable to disruptions.

In 2018, over half of all U.S. spending on food was on the commercial side of the supply chain. The introduction of social distancing measures in March forced schools, corporate cafeterias and many restaurants to close. As a result, a lot of food intended for commercial use no longer had a buyer.

Where the supply chains diverge

To understand why this food can’t readily be diverted to consumers, let’s take a closer look at the supply chains for meat, vegetables and milk. With each category, there are different reasons.

Vegetable farmers, for example, have a lot of crops growing in their fields intended for commercial buyers like schools, restaurants and cruise lines, which are no longer purchasing these products.

But a worsening labor shortage makes it a lot harder to harvest or pick their crops and package them for consumers.

So a combination of plunging commercial demand, not enough low-wage yet skilled laborers, falling prices and a short window in which to pick vegetables means it has become cheaper to simply let them rot in the fields.

As for meat, restaurants typically order larger cuts and use more of the pricier parts like tenderloins. In contrast, much of the meat purchased on the consumer side is sold in “case-ready” packages, and ground beef is far more common.

So in general, commercial buyers tend to buy parts of the cow or pig that consumers simply don’t prepare at home. But what’s more, meat plant closures due to COVID-19 outbreaks are creating a bottleneck for slaughtering and processing animals, which also have a short window before they’re past their prime.

As a result, producers, particularly pork farmers, are debating whether to feed and care for their animals past their prime or simply euthanize them.

Milk is even more complicated when it comes to how it flows along the food chain.

First, there’s no stopping cows giving milk; udders that are full must be emptied daily. The only question is where that milk will go.

Restaurants and organizations like schools purchase nearly half of all milk, butter and other dairy products processed in the U.S. Pizzerias alone take nearly a quarter of all U.S. cheese production.

With many of these customers closed or cutting their purchases, there’s lots of excess milk. Unfortunately, processors do not have the equipment to package that milk into smaller containers for grocery stories and retail use.

As for converting more milk into dairy products with longer shelf lives like cheese, there was already a glut of mozzarella and other cheese plugging up cold storage space. And despite a rise in takeout pizza, overall demand for cheese has “dropped like a rock,” according to trade industry sources.

That has left dairy farmers with little choice but to dump excess milk into manure ponds and ditches.

A longer-term problem

Many states are working on short-term solutions to bridge the gap between the two supply chains.

Nebraska is temporarily allowing restaurants to sell unlabeled packaged foods to customers, Texas is pushing restaurants to prepare food care packages for at-risk families, and many other states have changed their health regulations to allow restaurants to repackage products into smaller quantities to sell to the public.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to begin purchasing $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy and meat to support farmers and eventually distribute it to food pantries and other organizations feeding Americans in need.

Although helpful in the short term, we believe a longer-term problem that needs to be addressed is how concentrated food supply chains have become, which has made them less nimble in adapting to disruptions like a health pandemic.

J.B. Pritzker said the state needed to process 10,000 coronavirus tests each day to get ahead of the outbreak gripping Illinois, average daily testing numbers are still 40 percent short of that goal.

While Pritzker and the federal government say the state now has the machines needed to conduct thousands of more tests, a shortage in necessary supplies to actually process those tests has limited how many can actually be completed, officials say.

What’s more, some national projections adjusted for Illinois’ population suggest the state may need to process roughly 15,000 to 900,000 tests a day to be able to confidently chart the next steps toward returning to normal. Some experts say more tests are needed to screen individuals without symptoms who could unwittingly spread the disease and check people who are considered high-risk multiple times.

“We will never, ever get out of the stay-at-home order unless we do massive amounts of testing of those people at highest risk for COVID-19,” said Dr. Howard Ehrman, a former deputy commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health. “If Pritzker takes us out of the stay-at-home order before enough testing is done, either partially or completely, then thousands of more people will get infected and die.”

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, agrees that it’s vital to ramp up testing to understand the true reach of the virus, isolate those who are infected, enable public health workers to trace the contacts of those who have been infected and ultimately get Americans back to work.

“Anybody should be able to be tested,” said Murphy.

However, he acknowledged the state — and nation — are a long way from being able to do that.

Goal set weeks ago

On March 29, Pritzker told reporters that he hoped the state would scale its testing capacity from roughly 4,000 tests a day at the time to the elusive 10,000 mark in just 10 days, or by April 9.

But since that deadline — a period in which Pritzker updated the state’s criteria for testing to include anyone with symptoms and additional sites started testing — an average of only 6,149 daily tests were reported. Nearly 8,600 tests were done on April 12, the most on any single day, but the number has dropped again, including on Tuesday when 6,639 tests had been processed in the previous 24 hours.

“There isn’t enough testing and there won’t be for some time to really open everything up,” Pritzker said during his daily press briefing. “And the fact that we’re going to need a whole lot more means we have to leave things still in a place that seems not normal to everybody and won’t be for some time.”

Illinois isn’t the only state struggling to run more tests, though. The lack of widespread testing has remained a critical issue since COVID-19 was first detected in the U.S. in January, and failures on the federal level appear to have set the country back as the deadly virus took hold.

Considerable steps have since been taken to bolster the country’s testing capacity: New diagnostic tests have been rolled out, more testing sites have cropped up and major commercial labs are now processing results.

Supply shortage

But whether having more capacity is enough to boost the actual number of tests taken and processed is another question.

President Donald Trump continues to spar with several governors as his administration insists that states aren’t utilizing their entire testing capacity based on the number of testing machines at hospitals and labs. Illinois, for example, has enough machines to run 16,000 to 30,000 tests a day, the federal government said in documents released Monday.

Pritzker pushed back, noting that states require more swabs to take samples from people, and more materials to transport those samples to labs and process them. He has not made a new estimate on when the state could reach the 10,000-test threshold.

Murphy said making sure the states have enough supplies to increase testing is “obviously a federal thing. ... The supply chain involves multiple states and even multiple countries, so who can coordinate that?”

10,000 not enough?

Even once the state gets to 10,000 tests a day, that isn’t enough to truly return things to normal, some experts said.

The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C., is calling for 371,000 daily tests, while former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottleib holds that 430,000 coronavirus tests should be processed each day, according to a report released Friday by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer believes half the country should get tested each week, amounting to 23 million tests a day.

Adjusting those models for Illinois’ population of 12.67 million, or roughly 3.9% of the national populace, the state would have to process between 14,469 and 897,000 tests each day.

“There is not yet consensus over what approach to testing is required for social distancing measures to be loosened, or exactly how much capacity is needed,” the Kaiser report stated. “But, by any measure, it is clear that we are far from being able to do enough tests to enable us to move to the next phase of responding to the pandemic in states across the country.”",real
717,1903,https://www.rt.com/uk/489556-dominic-cummings-lockdown-bbc-kuenssberg/,2020-05-23,BBC blasted after political editor jumps to defend PM adviser Cummings following cross-country lockdown breach,"The revelation that Boris Johnson’s top adviser traveled over 250 miles to his parents as he had Covid-19 symptoms has unleashed outrage in the UK. The BBC is also under fire after its political editor jumped to defend the move.

News of Dominic Cummings’ egregious lockdown breach emerged on Friday night in reports by the Mirror and Guardian news outlets. In March, the prime minister’s closest adviser allegedly traveled from his London home to his parents’ farm in Durham, in northern England, when a strict lockdown was already in place and after he displayed symptoms of coronavirus.

In a bewildering move, the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg leaped to the defense of the government adviser on Twitter. She replied directly to a post by Daily Mirror political editor, Pippa Crerar, to say that a “source” had informed her that Cummings’ trip was “within guidelines,” as he had made the 400km journey to stay with his parents so they “could help with childcare while he and his wife were ill.”

Source says his trip was within guidelines as Cummings went to stay with his parents so they could help with childcare while he and his wife were ill - they insist no breach of lockdown — Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) May 22, 2020

The BBC chief political reporter’s decision to cite unnamed sources in a bid to spin a story that made the government look bad raised the hackles of many, with countless people asking why Kuenssberg was acting as a spokesperson for the government. It was repeatedly noted that there is no childcare provision in the lockdown measures, something of which Kuenssberg surely should have been aware.

is rebuttal for the PM's advisor your job? — Aaron Bastani (@AaronBastani) May 22, 2020

“Does the BBC have no consideration for millions of grandparents who, respecting the rules, have made the sacrifice of not seeing their grandkids over the past two months? Like his boss, Cummings acts with impunity while the press fail to hold him to account. #NameTheSource,” musician Billy Bragg wrote.

Piers Morgan’s succinct reply simply dismissed Kuenssberg’s reporting as “absolute nonsense.”

The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is now commenting on other journalist’s posts in an attempt to defend Cummings.In what world is that ok?!More than 300 health and care workers have died for heaven’s sake. https://t.co/XGbFrsI25n — NHS Million 💙 (@NHSMillion) May 22, 2020 Just the BBC Political Editor replying with Tory spin to another journalists story about Cummings breaking the lockdown advice. Completely, totally normal. https://t.co/ZQb4mwSA6P — Liam Young (@liamyoung) May 22, 2020

At the time of writing, the political editor’s message had racked up a staggering 13,000 replies, leaving it with an appalling ratio of around 13 replies to every one like. ‘Laura Kuenssberg’ trended in the UK due to the deluge of negative reaction. Other related trending topics were ‘Durham,’ ‘#SackDominic,’ ‘#resign,’ and ‘#DominicGoings.’

Kuenssberg even lost some defenders with the shoddy reporting as many took issue with her responding to another political editor to refute their story. “I defend Laura K a LOT but replying to someone’s thread on a scoop like this trying to spin a line from a ‘source’ is a very bad look,” the Mirror’s Tom Davidson said.

It feels weird that LK would respond to another political editor to refute their story, as if Pippa has not done her due diligence or also has contacts to stand up the story? She’s not the comms for Cummings, it feels odd? https://t.co/0CeCFn5Sa4 — Mollie Goodfellow (@hansmollman) May 22, 2020

Editor, Health Impact News

Fear over the coronavirus is gripping the nation and world, as within a short period of time life around the globe has drastically changed very suddenly.

The main question facing everyone in the U.S. today is: How serious is this? Is the response the government is making right now consistent with the threat this virus presents?

Some are proposing that anyone in the media who dares to question the official narrative should be silenced for the sake of “public health.”

Facebook, for example, took strong actions against Health Impact News by claiming we were publishing “fake news,” mainly by publishing the views of Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, who published news about successful intravenous Vitamin C therapy which had started in China. See:

And yet this week, the New York Post reported that the same therapy had started at hospitals in New York City. See:

With the Coronavirus situation affecting virtually every single person on the planet right now, suppressing alternative information that goes against the “mainstream” narrative is a very dangerous precedent, and is a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

It is especially concerning when one of my colleagues in the alternative media, without even contacting me directly, publicly demands that we retract one of our articles authored by a medical doctor, simply because this person believes his view of the current situation is the only correct view.

I do not pretend to be an expert on medical science, which is why Health Impact News publishes alternative views by medical doctors and other scientists who are experts in their field.

During difficult days like the ones currently facing us, I believe the public has a right to read all sides of the issue and make up their own minds. Caution is certainly prudent, but fear?

Among all the Fear, Where is Faith in God?

The opposite of fear is “faith.”

Have we lost our way as a nation? Does the phrase inscribed on our currency “In God we Trust” mean anything anymore?

Faith in God does NOT mean we will not face difficult times. On the contrary, often those who are most faithful face the most difficult trials in life.

Faith in God means we trust that there is a stronger power than ourselves controlling the affairs of humanity, and that if we trust in him, he will give us the strength to endure whatever trials come our way.

Quick decisions based on fear seldom turn out well.

I will not pretend to know what is going to happen in the immediate future, and I do not claim to be a mouthpiece for God to tell you what to do.

My own personal belief system trusts God, and I also believe that in this point of history, being on this side of the death and resurrection of the Messiah Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial death on the cross paid the penalty for all of our sins, means that every single person can have a direct pipeline to God if they will just seek him.

God has a specific plan for your life, and only YOU can know that by seeking him out during these difficult days.

Don’t listen to me or anyone else who claims to know what God’s plan is for your life, because he is more than willing to lead you and guide you if you seek him out.

Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!

(Matthew 7:7-11)

I, for my part, will endeavor to give you as much information as possible, which will often contradict what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media reports, and may also contradict what others in the Alternative Media are writing.

For today, here are the perspectives of 12 medical scientists who are concerned about the current narrative being reported in the mainstream media.

Thanks to Off-Guardian.org for putting this together.

12 Experts Questioning the Coronavirus Panic

Dr Sucharit Bhakdi is a specialist in microbiology. He was a professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene and one of the most cited research scientists in German history.

What he says:

We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realise that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day. [The government’s anti-COVID19 measures] are grotesque, absurd and very dangerous […] The life expectancy of millions is being shortened. The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations cancelled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society. All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.

Dr Wolfgang Wodarg is a German physician specialising in Pulmonology, politician and former chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 2009 he called for an inquiry into alleged conflicts of interest surrounding the EU response to the Swine Flu pandemic.

What he says:

Politicians are being courted by scientists…scientists who want to be important to get money for their institutions. Scientists who just swim along in the mainstream and want their part of it […] And what is missing right now is a rational way of looking at things. We should be asking questions like “How did you find out this virus was dangerous?”, “How was it before?”, “Didn’t we have the same thing last year?”, “Is it even something new?” That’s missing.

Dr Joel Kettner is professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases.

What he says:

I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why. […] I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that. […] In Hubei, in the province of Hubei, where there has been the most cases and deaths by far, the actual number of cases reported is 1 per 1000 people and the actual rate of deaths reported is 1 per 20,000. So maybe that would help to put things into perspective.

Dr John Ioannidis Professor of Medicine, of Health Research and Policy and of Biomedical Data Science, at Stanford University School of Medicine and a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences. He is director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center, and co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS).

He is also the editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. He was chairman at the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine as well as adjunct professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.

As a physician, scientist and author he has made contributions to evidence-based medicine, epidemiology, data science and clinical research. In addition, he pioneered the field of meta-research. He has shown that much of the published research does not meet good scientific standards of evidence.

At Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Lake View, Carmen Benabe, 86, was released to quarantine at home four days after being admitted to the emergency room with a COVID-19 diagnosis, according to a release from the hospital system. Benabe’s daughter, Dalia Colon, said the family is thankful in a statement, and that her mom is looking forward to enjoying home-cooked Puerto Rican meals again soon.

At Advocate Trinity Hospital on the South Side, Paul Richards, 69, a retired Chicago firefighter and a Vietnam veteran, headed home amid a standing ovation, passing handmade posters that read “#GOINGHOME” after he spent two weeks on a ventilator for COVID-19 symptoms.

“It was like being in Vietnam,” Richards said in a release from the hospital. “Everyone responded with no hesitation. Everyone stepped up to do what they had to do and put their lives on the line to care for me.”

Dr. Gary Stuck, chief medical officer of Advocate Aurora Health, said he was “grateful for [the] service and sacrifice” of doctors and nurses at the hospital system, emphasized that there’s more work to be done, for medical staff and for Chicagoans. According to the latest figures from the state, Illinois has now seen 868 deaths and 23,247 coronavirus cases.

“The public must continue to do their part by practicing social distancing and staying home as much as possible,” Stuck said in a release. “There will be more milestones to come, both happy and tragic. And our actions now will determine how much celebrating or grieving we do later. We’re all in this together.”",real

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has tightened requirements to comply with the regime of high alert in connection with the spread of the novel coronavirus. New restrictions were introduced for individuals over 65 of age, as well as for people with chronic diseases, as well as for families with children.

""The novel coronavirus primarily poses a threat to life and health of the elderly and people with chronic diseases, for people with low immunity. Therefore, our main task is to protect you, Muscovites of older generation,"" Sobyanin wrote on his blog.

He noted that many senior citizens do not comply with recommendations of the authorities not to leave home and to limit contacts with other people, even though such activities pose a great risk to their lives.



In this regard, from March 26 to April 14, Muscovites suffering from chronic diseases, and all older people over 65 of age are required to stay home and go out only in case of urgent needs. Yet, this requirement does not apply to the president of the Russian Federation, who is now 67 years old, the Kremlin said.



The mayor also asked elderly and chronically ill people not to visit any public places. It is allowed to go out to grocery stores or pharmacies only when needed.

Here is the complete list of diseases, with which it is forbidden to leave home:

insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus;

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;

asthma;

bronchiectatic disease;

circulatory system disease - pulmonary heart and pulmonary circulation disorders;

the presence of transplanted organs and tissues;

chronic kidney disease stage 3-5;

malignant neoplasms of any localization;

suffered a heart attack or stroke;

acute leukemia, high-grade lymphomas, relapses and resistant forms of other lymphoproliferative diseases, chronic myelogenous leukemia in the phases of chronic acceleration and blast crisis, primary chronic leukemia and lymphomas.

Visiting medical facilities for treatment of the above-mentioned diseases will not be considered a quarantine violation. The self-isolation regime does not apply to patients assigned to the third clinical group (oncology).

Over the last 24 hours, 71 new cases of coronavirus infection were detected in Russia, all of them - in Moscow. Thus, the number of coronavirus-positive patients in Russia has amounted to 438.",fake
746,312,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/13/21220045/19-immigrant-children-chicago-detainee-shelter-tested-positive-covid-19,2020-04-13,At least 19 immigrant children at Chicago detainee shelter tested positive for COVID-19,"This article is copublished with ProPublica Illinois, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

At least 19 children and two employees at a Chicago shelter for immigrant youth have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, in what appears to be the largest outbreak of the virus in the country in shelters for unaccompanied minors.

According to an email sent to staff Sunday, Heartland Human Care Services officials said the first positive test results were reported at its Bronzeville shelter on Friday and that additional cases there were confirmed over the weekend.

On Monday, officials from Heartland Alliance, the umbrella nonprofit organization that oversees the shelter program, confirmed the positive tests and said they expect there will be more cases.

“We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption,” Mailee Garcia, a spokeswoman for the organization, wrote in a statement. “The prognosis for all of the children in our care is very good, and we are continuing to focus on our participants’ health and well-being.”

As of last Wednesday, only six COVID-19 cases had been confirmed among children and adolescents housed in shelters around the country, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the nation’s shelter program. All six were at shelters in New York.

ORR officials said there were also 39 “self-reports” of positive COVID-19 tests among personnel affiliated with shelter programs in six states as of Wednesday. ORR has not provided updated figures, despite repeated requests since Friday.

COVID-19 is a less serious health threat to children than it is to adults.

Heartland, according to the copies of the email obtained by ProPublica Illinois, began “trying to secure tests” for children at the Bronzeville shelter after some of them displayed “COVID-19-like symptoms,” wrote David Sinski, executive director of Heartland Human Care Services.

The email doesn’t detail symptoms, when they became evident or when children were tested. But by Friday, Heartland officials learned that one of its “participants” — as the immigrant children and youth are called — had tested positive.

On Saturday, officials were told that three additional children had tested positive. By Sunday morning, they received positive COVID-19 diagnoses for an additional 15 children, bringing the total to 19. According to the email, 10 of the 19 children are asymptomatic. Two staff members have also tested positive.

“We understand that receiving this news may leave you feeling uncertain and scared,” Sinski wrote to staff. “I want you to know that we are committed to providing you with the information that you need to know in order to keep you and your loved ones healthy and safe.”

It’s unclear how old the infected children are or where they are from. But the Bronzeville shelter, a four-story converted nursing home that can hold up to 250 boys and girls, is licensed to house children from infancy to 17 years old.

Officials said they “immediately” move children to an isolated environment when they show any signs of any illness, including COVID-19, to minimize any risk of community spread. Since Saturday, Heartland has “enhanced our social distancing measures” at the shelters to limit the contact among children and between children and staff, Garcia said.

In his email, Sinski wrote that all remaining children at the facility are being tested and that he expected those results by Tuesday. He also asked all employees who worked on the floors where children who tested positive were living to stay home with pay for two weeks. Staff members who undertake “specific activities” with children will be provided N95 masks, gowns and gloves, and are being screened for COVID-19 symptoms before each shift.

Heartland officials said they are now contracting with additional nurse practitioners to be at the shelter for every shift. They are also exploring a house parent model, which would have a subset of staff be onsite full time for the coming couple of weeks, officials said.

Heartland officials said the organization is in close contact with ORR and city public health officials.

Shelters for immigrant children, nursing homes and other congregate facilities must report to the city of Chicago when there are two or more positive COVID-19 cases, according to a March order. The city’s Health Department then provides “tailored guidance to facility staff on infection control, including cleaning protocols and how to properly manage both COVID-19 positive and exposed individuals,” a spokesperson said in a statement, adding that clusters of cases have been identified in “several facilities.”

Garcia said the organization is “doing all that we can to advocate for additional testing kits for participants and staff across our programs.” She added that “our team have been stellar and courageous champions during this pandemic, committed to both a high level of quality care and being creative and supportive to each other during this challenging time. They are true heroes.”

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, which licenses the shelters, has been notified that children at the facility tested positive. “We’ve been in contact, and we’re offering assistance,” said agency spokesman Jassen Strokosch.

Heartland officials said a professional cleaning company has performed multiple cleanings of the facility in the past week and will continue to perform weekly deep cleanings.

According to ORR guidance meant to limit the spread of COVID-19, children who have symptoms and are recommended for testing are isolated from other children pending test results. Shelter programs are required to do twice-daily temperature checks of immigrant children and alert ORR if a child has a temperature above 100 degrees. ORR has also implemented a mandatory temperature check for anyone entering a shelter, according to officials.

ORR has also stopped placing children at shelters in California, New York and Washington, with limited exceptions, and said it is trying to find local shelters for newly arrived immigrant children to limit air travel. Previously, children were moved to shelters around the country where beds were available.

About 2,800 children are being held in the nation’s shelter system. There are 69 children at three shelters run by Heartland. The organization previously operated five shelters, all in Chicago, but has consolidated the program in response to COVID-19. “Our census was lower and consolidating sites has allowed us to implement the measures . . . to safeguard the health of our staff and participants,” a spokeswoman said.

No children have tested positive for COVID-19 at another group of shelters in Illinois run by Maryville Academy, a Catholic child welfare agency, said Sister Catherine Ryan, Maryville’s executive director. About 30 teens are currently housed at two Maryville shelters.

“I’m very grateful that all of our children are fine,” Ryan said. “Obviously, we are taking a lot of precautions to keep it that way.”

Lawyers and advocates for detained immigrant children say they’ve been worried an outbreak would occur in a shelter. Lawyers went to court in late March to ask the federal government to speed up the release of children in its custody.

“It’s been our concern all along as advocates that jails, prisons, detention facilities, even licensed shelter detention, it’s where we’re going to see the massive outbreaks and it’s going to be exponentially higher than in the broader community,” said Holly Cooper, co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.

Cooper said she is particularly worried about children who have preexisting conditions that have not been identified by shelter officials or ORR and will make them more vulnerable to COVID-19.

“The goal,” she said, “is to get kids out of congregate care because there’s no way it can comply with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance even if you’re using all the hand sanitizer in the world.”

The unofficial start of summer is just over a week away!

But unfortunately, summer is canceled. Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.

In Wisconsin — where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago — the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?

Rising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.

Now we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?

For starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.

We had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs — from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good — about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.

Theme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.

Theme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.

Here are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.

""California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,"" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.

""We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,"" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. ""The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.""

""We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,"" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. ""Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.""

I don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.

But if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.

""Full recovery"": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.

Oil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.

Natural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.

""Go it alone"": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.

Global demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.

""By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,"" they said.

""Greener growth"": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.

Oil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.

Most remarkably, ""the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,"" the analysts said.

Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry — once synonymous with American energy dominance — is not exactly celebrating.

As we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.

History lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.

Investors made a lot of money when they invested on ""the dip"" around 2009, when oil prices were low.

Those investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.

An unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A — the main source of capital gains for investors — to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)

So when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.

Where we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.

That means they'll be forced to go into what he called ""blowdown"" — diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.

US production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.

Where we are headed: ""What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.""

With the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the global economy, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have started paying banks to borrow from them, hoping they will keep the credit taps open for cash-strapped households and companies.

This subsidy is the newest twist in the topsy-turvy world of negative rates policy: rather than just punishing banks for sitting on their idle cash as they have been doing for years, central banks are now rewarding them for lending, or, in the ECB’s case, just for the mere fact of borrowing.

It also marks a shift that makes any further cut to the ECB’s and BOJ’s negative deposit rates – an increase in how much banks pay for parking their excess reserves – unlikely soon, even as money markets begin to price in chances that negative rates may soon make debuts in the United States and Britain.

Indeed, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emphasized last week that he saw no need to deepen negative interest rates now.

“At this moment, we don’t think it’s necessary,” Kuroda said last week. “The most important thing now is to provide necessary financing to firms through the banking system, and to make financial markets stable,” he said in a seminar organized by the Financial Times.

AN EASING FOR BANKS

When the coronavirus pandemic hit the euro zone in March, the ECB was widely expected to cut its deposit rate again. But it refrained from doing so, instead offering banks loans at negative rates as long as they didn’t shrink their loan books.

The terms were later improved, with banks getting 0.50% for one year with no strings attached, or 1% if they don’t shrink their loan books.

The BOJ, which learned from the ECB in introducing negative rates in 2016, is now following suit in retreating from the policy.

Last month, it decided to pay 0.1% interest to financial institutions tapping its crisis-response lending program. That led to a surge in participating lenders.

It also was a departure from the BOJ’s long-held skepticism over rewarding banks for borrowing for fear of drawing criticism as unfairly subsidizing them.

“By offering a 0.1% interest, we’d like to incentivize (commercial banks) into helping us extend financial support to a wider range of firms,” Kuroda said last month.

Japanese bank lending rose steadily after Kuroda took the BOJ’s helm in 2013, including after the adoption of negative rates in 2016. But analysts attribute the increase more to rising loans for property investment.

While negative rates apply to only a small portion of banks’ reserves, they crushed already-narrowing profit margins at weaker regional banks. The BOJ warned in April that dwindling profits had driven banks into taking on more risk, enough to potentially destabilize Japan’s banking system.

NEGATIVE INTEREST? NOT INTERESTED

The questionable effect on lending has led many other central banks to look askance at negative rates, an issue raised again in the face of monumental job losses and activity declines resulting from efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke strongly against the idea in a webcast appearance last week, saying negative rates are “not something that we are looking at” even while the next steps to battle the coronavirus-related economic downturn are examined.

The U.S. central bank, in its own way, has similarly tried to pull banks into helping with the rescue. It has trimmed what it charges banks to borrow to just 0.25%, negligibly above what they can earn on their reserve deposits. The change in terms for the “discount window” came with encouragement that banks use it liberally and take advantage of some relaxed oversight.

But negative rates are a non-starter as a policy matter. Though investors have been betting recently the Fed will be forced down that road, Powell’s critical stance is echoed by other policymakers who feel the stress on banks and the U.S. dollar’s unique global role make negative rates policy unwise.

The Bank of England also appears hesitant, although it has been less full throated than the Fed in shooting the idea down. Governor Andrew Bailey said last week the BoE is not considering taking “the very big step” of pushing interest rates below zero, but that was undercut days later by the bank’s chief economist telling the Daily Telegraph the central bank was looking at the idea at the idea “with somewhat greater immediacy.”

Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member, says it has become a “near-consensus” among global central banks that negative rates have huge drawbacks and mixed positive results.

“It doesn’t make sense to deepen negative interest rates and hurt banks when you’re actually trying to encourage them to lend more,” she said. “It’s a tool that is very hard to use at a time like now.”

Help from the banking sector is particularly important in Japan and Europe, where banks are the primary credit source for many companies.

Both the ECB and the BOJ have eased collateral requirements for banks that tap their loan programs. After blind-siding banks with the 2016 move to negative rates, the BOJ now frequently seeks their views on what framework works best for them.

In its role as the euro zone’s bank supervisor, the ECB has also let banks eat into their capital and liquidity requirements to navigate the current crisis and invited them to keep provisions sufficiently low to avoid further economic damage.

For a watchdog set up to clean up the banking sector after the financial crisis more than a decade ago, it was a major change of tack.

“Unlike in the 2008 financial crisis, banks are not the source of the problem this time,” said Andrea Enria, the ECB’s chief supervisor. “But we need to ensure that they can be part of the solution.",real

On Monday, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and R&R Partners – the advertising company behind the ""What happens here"" campaign – launched a new 30-second television spot, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

""The world has changed,"" a narrator says, ""and Vegas is changing with it.""

The ad is a response to the post-pandemic Las Vegas landscape – one that shut down in March to stem the spread of COVID-19, leaving thousands out of work and resorts scrambling to develop reopening plans.

The new campaign is called “Reimagined” and offers a toned-down glimpse of Las Vegas tourism, focusing on outdoor recreation and intimate settings. One shot shows a man and woman in a warm bar conversation, a glass of wine separating them.

""Things will be a little different when we open again – at least for a while,"" the narrator says. ""We're working to make it more intimate, with more space and the excitement you've come to expect.""

The new Las Vegas ad comes four months after tourism authorities unveiled the destination's new slogan: ""What happens here, only happens here.""

Las Vegas resorts prepare to reopen

In the aftermath of COVID-19, the casino experience in Las Vegas and greater Nevada will look a much different.

The Nevada Gaming Commission recently approved the Gaming Control Board's reopening policies, laying out what more than 400 large and small casinos need to do when shutdown orders are lifted.

Occupancy limits in gaming areas will be cut in half. Tourists will see chairs and stools in front of every other gaming machine. Gathering in groups – one time a staple of the Las Vegas experience – will be prohibited.

Dealers will even offer card players a complimentary squirt of sanitizer between hands.

COVID-19 is still spreading in Nevada

As tourism authorities plot new ways to entice travelers to return, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Nevada.

The number of Nevadan’s who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 increased to 6,906 on Monday, an increase of 49 new positive cases.

That rise is comparatively low to what the state has seen for nearly two months. The last time Nevada saw a lower single-day increase was March 24, when there were 43 new cases, according to a Reno Gazette Journal analysis of the numbers.

But Monday’s small increase is not necessarily a good sign.

While few people tested positive statewide, Nevada performed its smallest number of tests in several weeks – just 1,140. That figure is eclipsed by the 6,500 tests performed the day before.

With 49 positive residents out of a total of 1,140 tested, Nevada’s test positivity rate went up for the first time since May 2. That metric, which measures the proportion of people who test positive on a given day, increased from 8.5% to 8.6%.

The total number of Nevadans who’ve died from COVID-19 had not yet been updated on Monday and remains at 350.

My first hot flash hit inside the San Fernando Cathedral in San Antonio, where I’d traveled from Wisconsin to see the crypt of Davy Crockett. There was a baptism there that day, and a white-gowned baby howled when the priest cupped holy water over its head. I was jealous and wanted cool water splashed on me. My next feverish wave shoved me outside, to a pharmacy down the street, where a cheap thermometer told me I was running a tick high. The next four hours, wandering among the Alamo ghosts, mostly remain a blur.

These were my first symptoms, I think. It’s impossible to claw through the fog of a weekslong illness and pinpoint its initial strike. I could have caught it the next day when an airport employee coughed on my arm. I rushed to the bathroom, stripped my shirt, and furiously scrubbed my limbs up to the elbow. Two sinks over, a guy in a slick golf shirt sneered. I don’t usually bathe here, I wanted to tell him. A fit of hypochondria.

The following week, fleeting spells came and went, chills, a sweaty forehead, low-grade fever, odd body aches, weird, single-burst coughs.

My great-grandparents’ letters detail the origin of the 1918 flu pandemic in real time . Jeff Snowbarger

Hutchinson, Kansas

July 1918

Families, friends, and lovers packed the depot platform. They’d flocked in autos, surreys, and buckboard wagons to bid their boys farewell. With winter wheat harvest complete, the young men were off to war. No one knew how long the upheaval would last. Under a merciless Kansas sun, the press of bodies gripped Edward so tightly he nearly lost his suitcase. Mary squeezed at his side, but there wasn’t enough wiggle room for Edward to wrap his free arm around her. Despite their monthlong engagement, the lovers did not kiss goodbye.

The letters he wrote to the woman he was courting, my great-grandmother, detail the origins of the pandemic in real time.

Edward and Mary were my great-grandparents. Edward was 24, Mary 22. Both had been reared in devout homes steeped in Scripture and song. Their lives revolved on an axis of hard work and holiness revival. To them, chores and prayer were equal acts of worship. After he arrived at Camp Funston, the barrack boys couldn’t believe Edward had never kissed a girl. According to Mary, the nosy soldiers’ “indulgences were disgusting.”

During their three-year courtship, the pair exchanged hundreds of letters, which my grandfather saved in a beat-up steamer trunk that serves as our family archives. Edward lived on a farm 30 miles west of Hutchinson, while Mary’s folks bounced around town and finally settled in an orchard house on the outskirts of the small prairie city. Even through the days when they regularly met in person, their correspondence rarely stalled longer than a few days. Like the prairie that raised them, their penmanship was free of flourish, elegant in its plainness. Naïveté leaps off the page. Both were smitten—by each other, by God. As Mary wrote in June of 1918:

I wonder what you are doing this hot afternoon. I don’t see how you could endure it out in the field. … I picked cherries for three hours this morning, also picked a gallon of June berries before dinner. … I’m glad that Jesus can keep us even in hot weather.

At the depot that July, they had no clue what lay in store. No one forecast the long black cloud bearing down.

Six days after the baptism, a spasm gripped my chest, a brief lung squeeze familiar to asthmatics. I puffed my emergency inhaler and soon felt fine. For several days, the spasms returned, growing in frequency and punch. By now the nation was at war—the coronavirus had shut local schools, canceled March Madness, and begun overwhelming hospital beds. I wondered if my symptoms were simply manifestations of stress, the way our bodies sponge anxiety, uncertainty, until it dwells urchinlike inside us. Had the global panic attack hit me? Twelve days after the baptism, huffing, heart pounding, dizzy, I drove to the ER not knowing if or when I’d see my wife and kids again.

Camp Funston anchored a bend at the head of “the Kaw,” or Kansas River. Just west of camp, the Smoky Hill and Republican rivers joined to form the muddy flow that skirted Funston’s grid of long, rectangular barracks, chow halls, hospitals, parade grounds, quartermaster stations, classrooms, libraries, and company headquarters. Treeless hills nested the encampment, grassy oblong mounds of layered limestone and chert, otherwise known as the Flint Hills, the most dramatic topographical ripple splitting Kansas.

During the American mobilization for World War I, Camp Funston served as one of 16 Army training posts scattered across the nation. Here, the U.S. Army drilled enlisted and conscripted men, boys mostly, in marksmanship, tent pitching, and “practical bayonet combat.” On the flyleaf of his Infantry Drill Regulations manual, Edward wrote:

My General Orders are: I. To take charge of this post and all gov’t property in view. II. To walk my post in a military manner, keeping always on the alert and observing everything …

My great-grandfather. Jeff Snowbarger

At any given time, 30,000 to 50,000 people swarmed the military grounds. For every dinner shift, an ocean of coffee was boiled, a range of cattle consumed, a mountain of potatoes peeled. Sleeping halls held 150 beds so entire companies could bunk together. The claustrophobic quarters readied soldiers’ minds to be sardined into boxcars, transport holds, and, eventually, trenches gouged in foreign soil. Most Midwestern boys had never experienced this unnatural density of humanity.

When my great-grandfather arrived, Camp Funston had already proved to be a breeding ground for disease. The early months of 1918 saw local outbreaks of smallpox, spinal meningitis, measles, “lump jaw” or mumps, scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, typhoid, and cholera, not to mention the mostly unmentioned venereal or “social diseases,” which camp officers blamed on the “influences” of “immoral and diseased women” from Kansas City and Topeka. As an adherent to the tenets of Christian holiness, Edward avoided this final plague. The exuberant script on his discharge letter deemed his character Excellent. God was Edward’s only true lover. Twenty-four and kissless, a green enlistee in worldly war, he believed as it reads in Corinthians: “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”* Shortly after his welcome to Funston, Edward discovered God was not the only invisible presence to fear.

My nurse and doctor wore disposable smocks and gloves, face masks taped to their cheeks, and plastic shields like riot police. My oxygen levels were good; blood pressure high; 20 breaths a minute, also high. My flu test came back negative; chest x-rays looked clean. Diagnosis: upper respiratory infection with cough. The nurse who administered the COVID test warned it wouldn’t be pleasant—the nasal swab felt like a sapling being screwed into my brain. Labs are swamped, she said. Results won’t arrive for a week or more.

I was told to rest and hydrate; acetaminophen should help the aches; take your inhaler as needed; and come back immediately if your symptoms worsen. That night, back home, my fever spiked. My chest felt tighter than ever and waves of fever froze then broiled my bones. I quarantined myself in a side bedroom and woke the next morning tangled in wet sheets. The 10 steps to the bathroom were a woozy mountain climb.

Mid-August, Mary wrote:

Think I hear someone in Mr. Coleman’s melon patch. … Glad you are getting acquainted with some real Christians with whom you can associate. … I am so thankful to Jesus and all he means to my unworthy heart. … [T]he Eds’ brought their “Edison Phonograph” out here Sunday.

Simplicities filled Mary’s days: washing, milking, Papa’s threshing and apple picking, neighbor visits, piano lessons, prayer meetings, Scripture study, helping “the girls read Caesar.” Her letters plainly convey life did not halt once her fiancé stomped off to war.

Papa feels somewhat encouraged by his apples. I must get the cow in and milk. So will have to close. Our prayers are with you boys and we just want God to have His way.

Her dispatches to Edward read as if their casual conversations never paused, as if their faith in God and each other was sufficient to make her unseen, unreachable lover feel a sofa pillow away. “I don’t suppose you were very hungry for sausage by the time you had ground such a large amount. Were you?” More seasoned at culling heifers, tilling with draft teams, and sawing stovewood, Edward struggled through camp kitchen duty, and Mary relished small moments where experience gave her the upper hand.

By late September, another seeming triviality visits her page: “[M]amma read in the paper that it was a false alarm and that there wasn’t any Influenza in the state. So my hopes rose again.” She was responding to Edward’s news that Camp Funston was being quarantined and would impede her desire to travel his way and spend an afternoon picnicking, swapping dreams, parting in prayer.

This wasn’t Funston’s first medical lockdown of the year. Partial and individual quarantines and had been issued for spinal meningitis, smallpox, scarlet fever, German measles, influenza, and pneumonia. Quarantine restrictions limited travel on and off base and closed the camp to outside visitors. Night guards, posted on every street in camp, operated under strict orders to report any sign of sickness. Medical officers isolated symptomatic individuals, often ordering men to report to one of two canvas-roofed field hospitals erected a safe distance from the main hive of operation. Separate convalescent camps were built to house men who’d simply come in contact with a confirmed case of scarlet fever or measles. Other outbreaks forced command to sequester entire barracks to prevent disease from ravaging the wider camp.

Most soldiers took the separation measures in stride. Meningitis, scarlet fever, and measles were equally miserable to endure as they were communicable. Many relished the downtime, as quarantine offered a respite from hard labor for the first time in their lives. Others felt the ward walls pressing in: The snake squeeze of confinement made them itch, the un-American stricture of movement. Paranoia drove a handful insane.

“Much Ado About Nothing,” a nearby newspaper explained to its readers. “That’s what some people call all the care in vaccination and establishing quarantine and fumigating, but it is better to have the ‘much ado’ and ‘nothing’ serious as a result than to have no ado and death after death, as we did before they vaccinated, quarantined or fumigated.”

Americans of that era were so much closer to death and disease it seems unimaginable to us now. Everyone knew someone killed or maimed by illness. The average life expectancy was 50. A third of all U.S. deaths occurred in children below the age of 5. Mary had lost two younger sisters in a span of two years, one of whom passed a mere 36 hours after her first sniffle arose. Death came so quickly that the family didn’t know which ailment to blame. But it wasn’t just disease that shaped social consciousness—everyday life was lethal. When Edward was young, a wagon full of corn rolled over his head. The wheel crushed his skull into the sandy road, lacerating his scalp above the ear. The resulting scar traversed half the equator of his head. As a baby, he snagged his bonnet on a barbed wire fence. His mother found him hanging, kicking his feet, his asphyxiated face dulled blue. Scarlet fever struck Edward’s little sister blind. Elsie, not yet 2, was quarantined in a room with her mother. The last thing she ever saw was her father kneeling at the door, rolling her an apple across the floor.

The county Health Department called to notify us that our house had been placed under a 14-day quarantine. No one in; no one out. We were fine on supplies, I assured them. My wife having spent the first week of the crisis squirreling away flour, pasta, rice, etc., and purchasing a quarter of freezer beef. My only contribution to our future survival was our dwindling firewood supply, a decade’s worth of .22 ammunition, and a cooler full of on-sale corned beef my wife had begged me not to buy.

Luckily, the illness never stole my hunger. But the dehydration was extreme. Over the next six days, the height of my struggle, I guzzled three gallons of electrolyte water a day and still my cells seemed parched. My body quaked like it was being chewed apart from the inside, at the microscopic level. Bolts of energy I’d never experienced—strange zips I attributed to my immune system straining its gears—sliced through my veins. I could feel my whole body engaged in the throes of survival.

In early March of 1918, a company cook, Albert Gitchell, reported to camp feverish and short of breath. He would go down as the first victim of a peculiar influenza strain that, over the course of several weeks, swept Camp Funston. The short-lived but virulent epidemic resulted in 2,480 reported cases and hospitalized more than 1,000 men. Upon their arrival, soldiers had received numerous inoculations, all of which proved powerless against this particular strain. Newspapers called it simply a spat of “Lagrippe.” By mid-April most signs of flu decamped, save the 400 convalescents still wracked by coughs and the bodies of 46 men the epidemic struck dead. As spring rolled on, troops shipped out, and few paid attention to the potential consequences of their diaspora. Only a small group of doctors raised the alarm after exhuming unusually limp, soggy lungs while conducting postmortem exams.

A letter my great-grandmother wrote to my great-grandfather in 1918. Jeff Snowbarger

Though things had cooled at Funston, the strain, having stowed away in reassigned soldiers’ lungs, almost immediately began to boil up in Army camps nationwide. The speed with which it spread was breathtaking. Deploying from American posts, transit ships conveying fresh meat to the Western Front were hijacked by the virus, and once in Europe, the flu quickly raked the allied trenches and plagued civilian populations throughout Italy, England, France, and Spain. Wherever American soldiers beached, the virus went on a tear. By May of 1918, nearly three-fourths of the French army had succumbed to fevers, shivers, and aches. To everyone’s relief, summer saw case numbers drop, and by August, hopes flared that the pathogen was running out of steam.

Somewhere along the way, however, somewhere in the water-logged trenches, a humid field hospital, or a damp cathedral hastily converted to receive front-line casualties, a microscopic change occurred that spurred this influenza outbreak to become the most voracious plague since the bubonic days. Scientists believe, as it leapt from lung to lung, the virus morphed to work more synergistically with several strains of pneumonia-inducing bacteria. Once the influenza yoked its strength to secondary bacterial infections, the pathogen matured into an indiscriminate pestilence that mowed down young and old, rich and poor, sick and healthy alike. It was one thing to die in battle, for honor, glory, naïve excitement; it’s another, far more incomprehensible thing to go from a state of vim and vigor to drowning in your own juices in the span of a single day.

This was the influenza strain that returned to America in the late summer or early fall of 1918. Its circumnavigation had allowed the disease to shake its origins, which is why we don’t refer to the 1918 pandemic as the Kansas flu, as perhaps we should.

CALL IT “SPREE-ENZA” OR PLAIN SPANISH FLU: exclaimed a Topeka headline.

New Kind of Grip—You Swim on a Sea of Sickness—Want to Die and Can’t—It’s Some Ailment.

On Sept. 30, the flu first arrived in Mary and Edward’s letters, only as a “false alarm.” But soon, the outbreak was on everybody’s mind. On Oct. 2, a local doctor instructed readers of the Hutchinson Gazette:

It is easy to tell when one has this disease, because it is much more severe than even a very bad cold, and is accompanied by backache, headache—in fact aches all over. It may come on very suddenly, with bodily weakness, and the victim’s one best bet is to jump into bed and send for the doctor.

The next day, news broke: “The worst has come! Influenza, or ‘Spanish fleas’ as it is facetiously known to those who have not fallen into its clutches, descended yesterday upon three victims in Hutchinson … but there’s no system in going to bed, scared to death, the minute you begin to sneeze.” Clearly, a wickedly sick chicken had come home to roost, but at the time it was easy to joke about a “foreign” pestilence so few civilians had experienced firsthand.

Rural life had plenty of other worries. Some prairie folks still lived in dugouts, literal burrows in the earth. Mary’s letters mention family friends starting a new Colorado farm this way. Other settlers still lived in “soddies,” primitive rooms made of stacked prairie sod. Poor folk commonly shared roofs with gophers, pack rats, dogs, cats, chickens, goats, milch cows, rattlesnakes, and hogs. These pan-animal dwellings and the everyday closeness of human and animal life created ideal environments for pathogens to leap the species boundary, which is precisely how some experts believe the 1918 pandemic began. One Kansas family shared their dugout with a brood of burrowing owls that returned each May to rear new young in the same corner where the family kept their willow bassinet.

Six whole days my lungs felt limp, incapable of filling with air. My diaphragm seemed to seize like a blown piston. The underside of my sternum ached. The pressure was a bear that rode my chest. Since I was 10, whenever a similar breathlessness took hold, I could always suck my inhaler and achieve relief. Such spells never came more than a dozen times a year. But in the days following my ER stint, I found myself utterly dependent on my inhaler. Two puffs every four hours. Morning to midnight. No inhaler, no breathing. In the hours between, I had to think deep breaths into my lungs, mentally force inhalations past my bronchial forks and into the sore chambers starved for air. I kept my cellphone charged and a bag of clothes by the door.

On Oct. 4, Mary wrote to Edward explaining that she’d exhausted herself helping her father pick apples. She believed she’d worked herself sick. “It’s laughable to me now. … I don’t think I need any pity at all because I know it was my own fault.” Although the flu was nigh, Mary’s disposition remained hopeful. “I don’t mean to seem ungrateful to God for my health and I intend to be more careful. I sure want to live a useful life for Him. And even tho’ I see so much to do, around me I know God will give me the strength to do and He will never require more of me than I can do. I do realize that these are days when there is a plenty for everybody to do.”

What Mary didn’t yet realize was Edward had also fallen ill. In a previous letter, he’d broken the news he was “going to the trenches,” but this information did not affect Mary half as much as news that flu had sacked her fiancé. “I certainly think it was very considerate of you in not telling me you were in Hospital,” she wrote on Oct. 9:

Altho’ I have wondered many times how you are. And have prayed the Lord to be a wall of fire about you and shield you from the ravages of disease. And I’m sure “He has given His angels charge over thee.” I’m glad to know you has such a light case of it.

Her lover escaped the worst. After a week in the camp infirmary, Edward was released, but, for Mary, the reality of the influenza outbreak finally hit home:

Of course in reading so much about it in the papers, I couldn’t help but wonder if you would escape it. And at the same time I knew that you would be careful and also that you would be better able to throw off disease than if you were more “run down.” There are three cases of Influenza here in town and I’m not positive about it but heard that the schools are to close temporarily.

Mary’s gossip mill proved correct. That day’s Hutchinson Gazette reported: “Schools, Movies and Churches Closed by ‘Flu.’ ” In less than a week, rumors of a local outbreak had swelled into a public health crisis. Daily life changed overnight—“Alarming spread of epidemic causes drastic order by Health Board.” Not only were the main social hubs shuttered, authorities forbade public meetings “where more than 15 people may gather. … It was the only thing to do under the circumstances.” The following day, Hutchinson reported 28 new cases. Mary never complained about the church closures. She’d already experienced too much loss to believe God would heal and protect everyone she loved. Humbly, she understood that death sometimes usurps small liberties.

In a matter of months, the young couple discusses 25 sick mutual friends, five of whom end up dead.

The war still commanded headlines; influenza coverage often didn’t start until Page 3. But by now, the nation understood a new front in a different war had opened. Newspapers tallied mortality rates that proved two and three times higher than normal flus. “Even at the present stage,” a syndicate proclaimed, “it ranks as one of the worst plagues that has ever afflicted the country.” To keep the flu at bay, municipalities leveled severe restrictions. In New York City, “Sneezers and Coughers who fail to use handkerchiefs when the explosions occur in public are to be subject to $500 fine or a year in prison.” Entire towns blockaded themselves to keep out carriers. Condemned houses were torn down to build caskets from floor planks and siding, and before the ground froze, men dug mass graves. Cloth masks were everywhere. Quarantined homes set warning signs in windows. Even amid the nation’s massive plains, responses to the invisible vector caught everyone’s eye. As Mary noted, “We saw a number of Influenza cards as we were in town yesterday.”

Visibility, understandably, drove paranoia: “From what I read in the paper, I guess I had some of the symptoms of it,” Mary wrote, “but it was what I’d call a cold in my head. I had a start of it Wed. when I was writing to you and have been feeling rather ‘bum’ since then. Not bad enough that I couldn’t work but I have had to sneeze quite a lot and that just made me feel miserable.” Every sniffle, twitch, and ache became suspect. Every body was a source of fear.

Meanwhile, the flu continued to decimate Camp Funston. According to the Army Medical Department, September had seen 3,534 reported cases; in October, that number jumped to 11,290. The tide overwhelmed camp hospitals, relief organizations built temporary infirmaries, and the Army converted barracks to house battalions of sickened men. In all, Funston dedicated 22 buildings to the fight. The sudden strain on resources became so severe that healthy infantrymen, trained to join the trenches at a moment’s notice, filled in as nurses, sponging bodies, emptying bedpans, reading the bedridden magazines and mail, transcribing last desires and wills. Once recovered, Edward accepted “nurse duty,” knowing nothing of medicine but what he’d learned on the farm delivering foals and calves.

By late October, Hutchinson claimed hundreds of sick citizens. Mary expressed her dismay, writing, “It has really seemed rather alarming here because there were so many cases.” As often happened in her letters, alarm softened to existential contemplation: “How much these things ought to help us realize that life is very uncertain.” Eventually, the epidemic infected her letters as much as her habitual nods toward God. Responding to news that Edward kept busy attending military funerals, she pleaded, “May God continue to keep you in the hollow of His almighty hand.”

Others discovered the solace of quack remedies. One Hutchinson man touted the palliative magic of a particular “nasal douche and throat gargle.” The recipe, from a “celebrated New York physician, a specialist in disorders of the nasal tract,” consisted of “1 and ½ grains permanganate of potash, 90 grains chloride sodium (common salt).” The powder could then be divided into 20 doses, separately dissolved in hot water to create a pinkish pint that one could squirt up their nose. Another popular cure was an “Old Welsh Remedy” that included hot foot baths, opium, garlic, alcohol, and ice. Health officials regularly warned that “squirrel whisky was no cure for flu.”

“O, how wonderful it is,” Edward responded to Mary, “to be submissive to Jesus and trust him when all seems dark and unpromising.” Their letters don’t fully convey the pandemic’s brutality until names begin to appear—Ray Lange, Elmer King, Roger Winan’s wife, Brother Mendell, Mrs. Dunham and her family, Mrs. Mickey, and the Spurgeon family—“surely lots of folks needing help.” In a matter of months, the young couple discusses 25 sick mutual friends, five of whom end up dead. On visiting Mrs. Mendell after her husband passed, Mary wished she could have helped her with the wash, “But she said she was really better off when she was busy at something like that. She said she is so nervous and walks the floor and cries and grieves so much that she can see it is telling on her physically. So for that reason no doubt she needs something to occupy her mind and hands too.”

By January, Edward and Mary had experienced sufferings large and small, witnessed sickness and death on a scale that would have been unthinkable when they bid farewell on the train platform six short months before. Once the kaiser abdicated, and ink on the armistice dried, worry over Edward’s deployment shifted to the hope of discharge and the anticipation of coming home. After all, the couple had a wedding to plan.

Among all the letters they swapped, a January line lifts off the page. On hearing Edward’s discharge might still be months away, Mary wrote, “I want you to know that I am feeling fine.” It’s a subtle expression, a throwaway line, that without a sense of its darker context would read as trite filler. But surviving the fall of 1918 was a nearly providential feat. Amid an episode of wanton loss and private tribulation, relaying to a loved one that you are “feeling fine” is perhaps the truest, most honest way to gift another soul a boost of hope in the face of a shared, uncertain future.

Nearly two and a half months after I walked out of the San Fernando Cathedral, full breaths are still difficult to come by. Overall, I feel recovered. That is until my body reminds me I’m not and forces me to stop working, stop walking, stop reading, set the chainsaw aside, sit down, rest, now. While I can’t yet say that I feel fine, I can thankfully, gracefully say I am alive.",real

This article is part of Reopenings, a series about how businesses are operating during the pandemic.

You can gamble again in America—at least in the few parts of the country where casinos are cautiously reopening. Casinos in Oklahoma and Montana already have the go-ahead from their state governments to operate, though many are opting to stay closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some casinos on tribal lands in Michigan and Idaho have also opened their doors, since they’re only regulated by the federal government and do not have to abide by state-mandated lockdowns.

But casinos in the After Times won’t be the same bustling, hand-contact-heavy places they were. They’ll have fewer games, more protective barriers, and a lot less razzle-dazzle.

Take the Tonkawa Hotel & Casino, operated by the Tonkawa tribe and one of the few casinos in Oklahoma that chose to go back into business when the state’s lockdown on nonessential businesses ended on May 1. (Many tribes have opted to voluntarily follow state lockdowns.) Now the casino is spacing out slot machines, installing hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the property, requiring employees to wear masks and gloves, increasing the frequency of cleanings for cage counters and card tables, and using thermal cameras to check whether people entering are running a temperature above 100 degrees, according to its director of marketing, Billy Burt.

Expect similar protocols as casinos around the country reopen their floors. Executives at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut, have been following the initial openings in developing their own practices for when they eventually begin operations again, whenever that is. “Since we closed on March 17, we have been putting together a reopening plan,” interim CEO Jason Guyot said. “In our 28-year history, Foxwood had never closed its doors, so it’s been a pretty surreal process we’ve been going through.”

When Foxwoods reopens, it won’t offer poker, sports betting, keno, and bingo—partly due to crowding concerns, and partly because the casino won’t be bringing back enough staff at first to man all those games. For games like black jack, players won’t be allowed to touch the cards and decks will be switched out more often, particularly when a new dealer takes over a shift. Foxwoods is strongly considering putting up plastic partitions between slot machines as well as at card tables to separate dealers from gamblers and gamblers from one another. A Las Vegas company called Screaming Images is currently developing recyclable clear acrylic dividers to keep people semi-isolated, which are being tested at the El Cortez casino in the city’s downtown:

I shot photos of these partitions this morning for @mickakers story about a company building them. https://t.co/qzKWBHm7hz via @reviewjournal — Kevin M. Cannon (@kmcannonphoto) April 28, 2020

Many matters are still up in the air. For instance, it’s unclear when performers can put on shows again, given the crowds they attract. However, Guyot is generally not too concerned about crowding at the property overall, because it spans more than 9 million square feet. Foxwoods managers are still trying to figure out how to clean betting chips. According to Guyot, many cleaning chemicals can cause them to discolor or stick together. And though employees will be sanitizing the chips multiple times throughout the day, it’s still difficult to keep them clean once people start passing them around.

Foxwoods and many other casinos have self-exclusion lists for people with gambling problems who voluntarily ask the establishments to bar them from entry. Given that Foxwoods will require all visitors to wear masks, it may be difficult to identify these people. For now, the plan is to ask people to temporarily remove their masks during the screening process just long enough for a camera to get a good glimpse of their faces.

Like Foxwoods, most major casino chains have yet to set definitive reopening dates, though they have been gradually releasing details about the modifications they’ll be making to their facilities to limit the virus’s spread, partly based on stipulations from local regulators. For instance, the Nevada Gaming Control Board recently released guidelines for how casinos should adjust their business practices. Gambling establishments in Las Vegas and elsewhere in the state will need to devise plans to limit the number of people at card tables, sanitize items more regularly, and ensure that workers and guests are wearing masks. Wynn Resorts has said that it will be removing chairs from table games and has publicly released sanitation procedures for each individual game. The Venetian is using UV lights and electrostatic sprayers to clean its facilities. One Las Vegas casino is even handing out plastic sticks for people to press elevator buttons with, according to the Associated Press. Wynn and some other casinos are hoping to reopen at the end of May. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman has repeatedly called for the city to reopen and serve as a testing ground for the rest of the country.

The elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection.

These new regulations are sure to change casinos’ atmosphere and even the dynamics and strategy of some games. For example, craps tables in Nevada will only be allowed to have six players at a time, which probably means that casino floors will be a lot quieter. “Sometimes in a casino you hear all this screaming and yelling because at the craps table you get an excited crowd and somebody gets on a hot roll,” said Steve Bourie, author of the American Casino Guide. “Hard to do that with six people. Normally you’d have 20, 25 people around a hot table.” Bourie also mentioned that it’ll be tougher for card sharks, who usually make money off less-skilled players, to find targets since there will only be four people per poker table in Nevada rather than the usual 10. And he predicts that some casinos may have to raise limits on black jack games because the house won’t be able to make as much money with only three players allowed at each table.

Guyot has put a lot of thought into how these new measures will change the casino-going experience. He worries that it’ll be tough for employees to convey warmth and congeniality given that they have to wear masks and distance themselves from customers. “When you see someone with a mask on, even when you have one on, you’re not as comfortable engaging,” he said. “One of the biggest things from a team-member perspective is that there’s going to be less of that service interaction with a smile.” Foxwoods is working on altering its training program given that employees’ facial expressions won’t be as visible to customers.

When more casinos do get back up and running, Bourie isn’t quite sure just how many people will actually show up. He notes that the elderly population, which is a huge demographic for casinos, might not want to risk infection. “I’m sure a lot of people are going to be scared. It’s a form of entertainment and people develop habits of going to casinos and having fun,” he said. “But their habits have been broken, and they haven’t gone in six weeks or so. So some people may find that they might not want to go so much anymore. They’re scared.” Bourie noted that online gambling has seen a surge in recent weeks, so people may opt to stick with that for the time being.",real
789,229,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206656/lyft-scooter-free-essential-workers-coronavirus-health-care,2020-04-03,Lyft is offering free e-scooter trips to health care workers fighting COVID-19,"Lyft will provide free electric scooter rides to essential workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While most scooter-sharing programs in the US have temporarily ceased operations in response to the pandemic, Lyft is still operating scooters in a handful of cities, and the company wants to support the transportation needs of health care workers and others on the frontlines of the crisis.

Lyft is offering free scooter rides through April 30th, up to 30 minutes in length, for first-responders, health care employees, and transit workers in the following cities: Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica, and Washington, DC. Employers like hospitals, clinics, and transit agencies can email Lyft at heroscooters@lyft.com to obtain enrollment information that they can distribute to staff.

Lyft says it will prioritize scooter deployment near local hospitals for health care workers. The company is continuing to disinfect contact surfaces on scooters each time they are recharged, including handlebars, brake levers, bells, and throttles. The team is also disinfecting high contact surfaces on vans used to transport scooters at the start of each shift.

“Lyft scooters can play a unique role in providing essential transportation to critical workers.”

“Lyft scooters can play a unique role in providing essential transportation to critical workers on the frontlines against COVID-19,” said Caroline Samponaro, head of micromobility and transit policy at Lyft. “In a time of crisis, we know Lyft can be an essential lifeline, and we are proud to serve first-responders, transit, and healthcare providers as they serve the public.”

Previously, the ride-hailing company said it would provide free and discounted bike-share passes to essential workers in half a dozen cities. Free or cheap bike and scooter trips are especially useful as public transportation ridership continues to plummet in most cities and ride-sharing is not seen as a safe alternative. In fact, there has been a surge in cycling in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

Of course, Lyft’s ride-sharing business has plummeted as health officials instruct people to avoid unnecessary travel. The company’s rides business has been cut in half in recent weeks, according to The Information. Lyft’s revenue after paying drivers is likely to be less than $150 million a month currently, down from about $260 million a month during the first quarter of last year, the publication reports. Lyft’s rival, Uber, has also seen a huge drop in demand and sales.

Both companies have come under fire for classifying drivers and delivery workers as independent contractors. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote a letter to gig companies calling on them to “reclassify your delivery workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, and ensure they are provided a full suite of employee protections and benefits.”",real

Opinion contributor

COVID-19 has infected nearly 5 million people globally and killed almost 323,000. It can devastate a range of organ systems, including the lungs, the kidneys and the cardiovascular system.

But for those who get very sick and are lucky enough to recover, the virus carries another potential danger — to mental health. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 survivors could be at risk for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. As the number of infections continues to rise steadily, this potential hazard will also grow.

We have long known that being critically ill can lead to symptoms of PTSD, including chronic fear, arousal and avoidance. The reasons for this are complex. Having a life-threatening illness that requires intensive care can be terrifying. These patients are facing the possibility of their own death in a situation in which they have ceded control of their own bodies to strangers, often in painful or unpleasant ways. They often can’t move, they are intubated, and they receive medications that make them feel sick or cause them to drift in and out of consciousness.

This nightmarish experience is often the everyday reality of being hospitalized with serious illness. These patients can also fall into a delirium and, after they recover, they are disturbed by vivid memories of these hallucinations and misperceptions.

Brains primed to remember trauma

It also appears that being critically ill, particularly with severe infections that cause inflammation, can prime the brain to remember traumatic experiences. The brains of many of these patients are deluged with adrenaline, the fight-or-flight neurotransmitter. After all, what is more urgent than trying to stay alive? Adrenaline activates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain. When this happens, a person’s memories tend to be strongly encoded. This is a key reason that people tend to remember so much about traumatic experiences.

Many seriously ill patients can also experience a burst of inflammatory chemicals that triggers an additional adrenaline spike. On top of that, many of these patients suffer a dangerous drop in blood pressure, which is often treated with, you guessed it, a shot of adrenaline. As a result, many seriously ill people, including those with COVID-19, have very high levels of adrenaline, which likely affects how they experience the already distressing ordeal of being sick in the hospital.

As a psychiatrist who often sees survivors of critical illness, I am very familiar with these problems. In some ways, being seriously ill can resemble combat, another common cause of PTSD: In both cases, people feel extreme fear, intense arousal and a sense — often quite accurate — that they have little control over their own fate.

Given these circumstances, it makes sense that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be at risk for PTSD symptoms once they recover. The problem may be exacerbated because most hospitals are not allowing any visitors for these patients, so most of them must suffer alone, without family or friends.

Research suggests that PTSD symptoms are particularly common in people who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in which the lungs fill with fluid and breathing becomes difficult. Oxygen is central to life, and we have evolved to prize it intensely. Anyone who has gotten something caught in their throat knows how terrifying this feeling is. Now imagine that sensation lasting for days or weeks.

It cannot be ignored:During coronavirus isolation, treating mental health issues through telemedicine is vital

Of course, ARDS is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Many such patients must be attached to ventilators in order to breathe. A tube is inserted deep into their throats, which can give them the sensation of being choked. Often, these patients must be sedated and restrained to keep them from pulling the tube out in a panic.

The problem may extend beyond the hospital. The health care system has been stretched so thin that many COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms don’t go to the hospital at all. Some describe struggling over days to breathe freely. This group could also be at risk for persistent emotional effects.

Don't overlook PTSD after COVID-19

Because COVID-19 is so new, there is little research on its mental health consequences. A study of over 700 COVID-19 patients by Chinese researchers, published in March in the journal Psychological Medicine, found that an astounding 96% of them had significant PTSD symptoms during quarantine. This rate is much higher than what researchers typically find for non-COVID critical illness survivors. Most researchers agree that 20% to 25% of such patients end up with PTSD symptoms.

The high rate found in the Chinese study could be due in part to the fact that these patients were quarantined for weeks in hospitals, apart from family and friends. The United States has not used this strict approach. Nevertheless, not all of these patients had a serious illness. In that region of China, anyone who tested positive for COVID-19, whatever their symptoms, was quarantined.

A second crisis:Mental illness is epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic

PTSD after critical illness is treatable, with strategies similar to those used for PTSD triggered by other circumstances. For many patients, a combination of medication and psychotherapy can, over time, ease or eliminate symptoms. But because the problem remains unfamiliar to many doctors, including most psychiatrists, many of these patients don’t receive the help they need.

It is impossible to know how many Americans will ultimately be infected with COVID. But as the partial reopening continues, the number will likely stretch into the millions. Not all of these people will become seriously ill, of course, but many will. One recent paper from the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that about 9% of patients infected with COVID-19 require intensive care. Of those, tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands could end up with symptoms of PTSD.

Over the coming months and years, we will need to make sure that we focus on the mental health of these patients, providing the support they need to recover, not only physically but emotionally as well.

Instead, customers are getting used to new grocery store fixtures: Mask-wearing employees, plexiglass barriers at cash registers, one-way aisles and antibacterial wipe dispensers. Some of those will become the norm. Others will fade away as coronavirus cases decline. But many analysts predict the pandemic will change how customers stock their fridges and pantries and shape their expectations in the months or years ahead. Here's a round-up of five changes sparked by the pandemic:

No touching, please

Customers are more squeamish about germs — and that could linger. Grocers and other retailers have touted new and expanded contactless approaches to shop or check out. Walmart, for example, added a new feature to its smartphone app that allows customers to scan a QR code instead of touching a screen at the cash register. Other apps, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also allow customers to skip the credit card reader. With curbside pickup, customers can pop the trunk instead of going into stores. Some retailers have waived the need for a signature when people pick up groceries or get a delivery to their home. Some customers are opting for prepackaged goods, as they skip the deli counter and other parts of the store with additional food handling, said Jill Standish, Accenture's global head of retail. She said the grab-and-go items also shorten shoppers' time in stores, another common preference. Those approaches may stick because of their convenience, along with heightened safety.

'Go local' trend on steroids

Long before the pandemic, customers bought fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and supported local businesses, such as cheese shops. The pandemic is accelerating that trend, said Scott McKenzie, Nielsen's head of global intelligence. Now, he said, people gravitate even more to products grown or made closer to home. They're thinking about the long distances that produce, meat and other foods may travel and the borders they may cross before arriving to their kitchen table — and the many people who may touch them along the way. That's driving more interest in subscriptions to farm boxes and items with ""a shorter supply chain,"" McKenzie said. ""I call this the phenomenon of buying milk from cows you can see,"" he said.

Shift to online shopping accelerates

Grocery shoppers have downloaded new grocery apps and tried new online services. Those discoveries have shaken up habits and could lead to a meaningful shift in an industry that's been slow to go digital. Customers have used third-party delivery services, such as Instacart, FreshDirect and Target-owned Shipt, to get groceries. They've also ordered online and used curbside or in-store pickup at Walmart and Target. Only about 3% or 4% of grocery spending in the U.S. was online before the coronavirus outbreak, according to research by consulting firm Bain & Company. That could increase to between 5% and 10% after it, said Steve Caine, a retail expert and partner for the firm.

A personal touch by 'pickers'

Grocers will look for creative ways to strengthen relationships with customers and entice them to add more to their virtual baskets, as more customers shop online in addition to in-store. Employees who fulfill and bag online orders at stores — often called pickers or shoppers — will become increasingly important and could become a competitive advantage for retailers, said Eiko Kawano, a group experience director for digital consulting firm, Publicis Sapient. Grocers may use the employees as brand ambassadors and suggestive sellers, she said. Stores could ask pickers to upload a photo or a brief profile and allow customers to rate the pickers like Uber and Lyft drivers. Through a combination of personal relationships and algorithms, the shopper or picker could personalize customers' orders by recommending an item. And they could nudge customers towards higher margin items and discretionary purchases, too.

SUMMARY: White House forecaster thinks Americans will just stop dying. Trump bars pandemic task-force members from talking to Congress. US is facing a new, more dangerous coronavirus mutation. How much will we pay for a vaccine? We need a national plan, not local plans. The 1918-19 flu caused a surge of right-wing extremism. The Big 3.

Key forecasts for coronavirus deaths are rising as states reopen. Meanwhile, a White House forecaster thinks people are just going to stop dying.

Coronavirus-related deaths in the United States are nearing 70,000.

On Monday, as Insider's Sinead Baker reports, researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington nearly doubled their US death forecast to 134,000 by early August, with more deaths expected thereafter.

The IHME increased the death forecast because the epidemic peak in the US is lasting longer than expected and new cases are declining more slowly than expected.

As Insider's Eliza Relman reported on Monday, another forecasting model, featured in a government ""situation update,"" assumes a radical acceleration in daily new cases and deaths by the end of this month.

US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times

This latter forecast was apparently preliminary, and the White House and CDC have since disavowed it. But the researcher from Johns Hopkins who put it together told The Washington Post that ""there are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly.""

Meanwhile, the White House's own model is decidedly more optimistic.

The Post reports that economist and Trump adviser Kevin Hassett has developed a model that predicts coronavirus deaths will drop sharply this month and ""essentially go to zero"" by May 15. Here's his ""cubic fit"" model overlaid with the other models.

No one knows the future. Everyone is free to come up with their own forecasts. But some forecasts have more logic supporting them than others.

And the White House's, meanwhile, seems more like a dream. — HB

The White House has barred 'Coronavirus Task Force' experts from speaking to Congress

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and President Donald Trump during a briefing on the coronavirus at the National Institutes of Health, March 3, 2020, in Bethesda, Maryland. AP

The Trump administration this week squashed two efforts to start a broader conversation about its coronavirus response.

The White House barred the members of its pandemic task force from testifying to Congress, effectively preventing the legislative branch from asking any questions of the executive branch about the most significant global catastrophe since World War II. The White House claims it wants to keep task-force members from being distracted.

On the same day, the administration skipped a global vaccine summit designed to raise billions for research, rally public support, and start the conversation about how to collaborate globally on manufacturing and distribution.

What did the administration not skip? Self-promotion. It arranged for a friendly Fox News interview of the president inside the Lincoln Memorial, an unprecedented use of that sacred civic space.

This is a demoralizing trend: The Trump administration enthusiastically seeks any opportunity for self-promotion and aggrandizement of its COVID-19 response, any occasion when it can claim success.

But the coronavirus crisis is not a problem solved by mere claims, by the rhetorical energy the president specializes in. Solving it requires constant effort, improvement, revision, cooperation, clarity, and transparency. If the administration refuses to answer hard questions, listen to Congress, or even collaborate with allies, we'll continue to lag the world in stopping the pandemic. —DP

A study shows coronavirus may have mutated

An early draft of a study from researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory — which has not been published or peer-reviewed yet — suggests that the coronavirus mutated over the past few months. They concluded that the strain of the virus that has afflicted most people in the US is the newer version.

The researchers have not yet figured out whether one strain is significantly different or more harmful than another. If a virus mutates enough, it could have implications for treatments and vaccines, but researchers so far think the new coronavirus mutates at a very slow rate, which is promising.

In previous epidemics, such as the devastating ""Great Influenza"" of 1918-19, a second strain of the virus — the one that wiped out most of the estimated 39 million people who died — was more deadly than the first.

The challenge for vaccines, meanwhile, is that if a virus mutates a vaccine that works for one strain might not work for another.

The researchers' draft study itself is here, but it's dense. —HB

How much will a COVID-19 vaccine cost? Way way way way less than it's worth

COVID-19 vaccine trials are starting at an encouraging clip. Insider's Andrew Dunn reports on a new Pfizer one today.

But the high stakes and enormous costs of accelerating research have raised fears that a COVID-19 vaccine will be too expensive, and that whatever company makes it will score windfall profits.

Since there's not yet a vaccine, it's too early to answer the pricing and profit questions. But surveys I've seen, including this Insider story, suggest a possible cost of about $10 per dose when manufacturing gets scaled up. Here are a few key things to remember about that vaccine, when it does arrive:

It will need to be made available worldwide. There will be monumental pressure on the manufacturer and the nation that made it to license it globally. And if they don't license it, it will be pirated. It's too valuable for any country to go without it.

It will get cheaper as we learn how to make and distribute it better.

The company that makes it will earn billions in profits, even if their original research was funded by a government.

Most important, however much the vaccine costs, however huge the windfall profits to the manufacturer, it will be worth it.

Conservative estimates suggest COVID-19 will slash $3 trillion from global economic output in 2020. That's $375 per person this year alone. It will inflict trillions and trillions more damage in years to come.

If a vaccine ended up costing $100 per dose (and it definitely won't be that pricey), and we spent $780 billion to vaccinate everyone on earth, it would still be the bargain of the century. —DP

We need national leadership and a national plan

Many states in the US are beginning to reopen. Their eagerness is understandable: The pandemic and lockdowns are having a devastating effect on our economy, jobs, and lives, and we're desperate to get back to normal. And with warmer weather outside, and declining cases in some areas, patience is nearing its end.

The problem is that this initial phase of our national coronavirus-attack plan — mitigation — did not go as well as planned.

Nationwide, new cases and deaths per day have flattened (good), but they have not yet meaningfully declined (bad). Excluding the tristate area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, in fact, US cases per day are continuing to rise.

Two caveats to this. First, the economist Ian Shepardson points out that most of the increase outside of the tristate area is coming from only seven states. A trailing average of cases in 40 of 50 US states, he says, are now declining.

Second, the steady (and important) increase in US testing capacity may account for some of this increase in confirmed cases. But it probably doesn't account for all of it.

Most important, we still don't have a plan for the next phase or a leader to bring us together and lead us through it.

State and local governments do have a critical role to play. Each county, state, and region is facing a different situation, and each needs to approach their situation differently.

But US states and cities are not separate countries. US citizens — at least in normal times — travel freely from one state and city to another. Even if each state and city were capable of eliminating the virus on its own, traveling Americans would continually bring the virus with them.

If we want to get back to normal, therefore, we need a national approach, not just a state and local approach. The federal government can't just be a ""backup,"" as the Trump administration has recently been saying.

The federal government needs to lead. And the federal government needs a plan.

What do we need in this federal plan?

Mostly, funding. Funding for the states. Funding for testing. Funding for contact tracing. Funding for isolation and quarantine facilities.

But also leadership.

We need our federal government to use its resources and expertise to develop, communicate, coordinate, and execute a national and then global plan. We need regular updates from relevant experts on how the plan is going and how we're changing it as the circumstances change.

That's what our federal government is there for, after all. That's what we built it and pay it to do.

Will COVID-19 lead to a rise in political extremism?

German cities with higher mortality from the 1918-19 flu voted more heavily for the Nazis in 1932-33, a New York Federal Reserve researcher concludes in a new paper.

Even after controlling for other factors including income, religion, and ethnic makeup, flu deaths corresponded to a rise in right-wing extremism 14 years later. (Though not to a rise in left-wing extremism. Voting for the communist party was unaffected.)

Will COVID-19 cause a similar extremist surge in hard-hit countries? —DP

799,1230,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-uncertainy-national-conventions-local-leaders/,2020-05-16,Local leaders weigh in on COVID uncertainty surrounding national conventions,"There's no crying in baseball this year, because there is no baseball. There's also no basketball

and no Olympics. America's favorite sports are on hiatus, and swaths of the nation are under stay-home orders. At least voters will be able to tune in for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, which are still scheduled to take place in August in Milwaukee and Charlotte, respectively. (Granted — watching Donald Trump and Joe Biden accept the nominations of their respective parties is not exactly the same as watching a thunderous dunk from Greek Freak Giannis Antetokounmpo.)

Local and state leaders usually look forward to the spotlight afforded by the conventions, which typically draw thousands from around the country. But this year is different, given the COVID-related constraints. CBS News talked with community leaders, business owners, health experts and elected officials in both cities about their hopes and fears surrounding the conventions this year.

DEMOCRATS STRESS ""FLEXIBILITY""

Democrats have already begun to make concessions, announcing their convention would be postponed by a month, to August 17 because of the virus.

This week, the DNC advanced a resolution to allow delegates to attend the convention remotely and empower convention planners to make health-based decisions about the event without going through the usual lengthy approval process, a tacit acknowledgment that the convention could look different this year. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said this week he expects and hopes to have ""an exciting and inspiring convention in August in Milwaukee,"" but ""does this mean that a precise format has been decided? No.""

""We certainly don't want to plan an event that's going to put anyone's health at risk,"" DNCC spokesperson Katie Peters told CBS News. Peters said planners are ""building in as much flexibility"" as possible, to ""scale up or scale down as the nation continues to learn more about the direction that this health crisis is going.""

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley says the data will dictate when officials need to make a decision about how to conduct the convention, but for now, ""I don't think that it is appropriate for us to talk about a timeline."" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says there remain a wide range of ""contingency options"" due to the pandemic.

""When people leave, I want it to be clear that the event posed no risk to public health,"" Barrett said.

This is Milwaukee's first national political convention, so a virtual convention would be disappointing to business owners, elected officials and local activists. Even so, some who favor holding the convention if it's safe are concerned about its safety.

""I don't want the people I represent to get sick and die because of this,"" said Democratic State Representative Daniel Riemer, who represents part of Milwaukee. He believes some sacrifices may have to be made and wants to hear assurances from party leaders and health experts.

""I would want them to look me in the face, so to speak, and to be able to look the people of my community in the face and say, 'You are no more at risk because this is happening and here's why,'"" Riemer said.

The convention was not only a chance to show off Milwaukee but also presented an opportunity to highlight the city's challenges, says Angela Lang, executive director of the Milwaukee group Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. But she, too, worries about the thousands of visitors who might infect Milwaukee residents.

We ""need to make sure that we're walking the walk and making sure that everyone is safe,"" Lang said. ""If that means not having an in-person convention and not risking the health and safety specifically of black and brown communities, we need to do that as a party.""

""FULL STEAM AHEAD"" FOR RNC

As one of 11 cities to ever host both parties' political conventions, Charlotte will hold this year's Republican National Convention just eight years after the Democratic National Convention was there in 2012. Charlotte won a bid for the convention in 2018, over the objections of some residents.

Robert Dawkins, political director for the grassroots community organization Action NC, explained that Charlotte residents feared the gathering could attract radical right-wing groups and white supremacists, but now, they might welcome it, if reluctantly.

""It's been hard and simmering bad feelings about this convention coming here for the past year,"" said Dawkins. ""You're going to find now that people are like, 'Charlotte's taken such a beating that if this convention goes along and has to still be in person, we're going to turn our noses and just let you do it just because COVID has cost us so much money.'""

In April, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel tweeted the party is ""full steam ahead"" in planning for the event, which is scheduled for August 24-27. And the party is bringing in a health adviser to ensure the safety of convention attendees. McDaniel told the Washington Post that she's checking to see whether the federal government can provide protective equipment for both conventions.

Charlotte Assistant City Manager Angela Charles told CBS News that while COVID-19 has changed what it means to host an event safely, she's confident ""we've got the right people around the table to host it safely and securely.""

Charlotte City Councilwoman-at-large Dimple Ajmera, who voted against hosting the convention in 2018, has been receiving numerous emails from constituents.

""One resident said, 'Well, how can we go from gathering up just a few people now, to 50,000 in August?'"" Ajmera recalled. ""Some residents have said this feels like a slap in the face and this is not about politics, it's about people's lives.""

Another council member, Larken Egleston, who was one of four Democrats to vote in favor of hosting the convention, said it's too early to know how either convention should be modified, but called it ""foolish optimism"" to think it can be executed as originally planned.

""Some leadership around the RNC has said things like 'full steam ahead,'"" said Egleston, who is hoping to be a delegate for Joe Biden at the Democratic convention. ""That decision lies with our governor, with our state health director, with our county health director, and not with the president, not with the chair of the Republican National Convention.""

City Council member-at-large Braxton Winston III predicted that ""we're in trouble"" if we can't figure out how to ""make democracy work in a socially-distanced reality.""

He proposed top Republicans could meet at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, while state delegations meet at large stadiums in their home state, such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles or Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, to allow people to spread out.

""You're able to connect those folks through technology, but they are still able to meet together and caucus amongst each other,"" said Winston.

North Carolina state Senator Rob Bryan is the sole Republican representing Mecklenburg County in the state's general assembly. He reiterated that everyone, regardless of party, wants to keep people safe.

""Conversations go much better if you don't accuse the other person of wanting to kill people or you know, 'you want to kill all these businesses, you don't care because you've got a job still,'"" Bryan said, echoing what he's heard from some North Carolinians.

""IF YOU HAVE INFINITE RESOURCES AND A REALLY GOOD PLAN...""

Health experts in Wisconsin and North Carolina agree it's too early to tell what the pandemic will look like by convention time. It will depend on things like how well people follow social distancing and hygiene practices, testing and contact tracing abilities, as well as whether there's an effective treatment or vaccine — or flare-ups of the virus as states reopen. Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers this week that he does not expect to see a vaccine by the time school begins in the fall, which would put it out of the reach of the conventions, too. These metrics will likely determine what type of event could be safe.

""You're going to have a second wave, no matter when you open,"" said Dr. Colby Ford, of the University of Charlotte's Bioinformatics Department. ""It's just how large is that second wave going to be, and can we hold off on reopening or reconvening in social settings until we have a way to combat the virus.""

""If there is a secondary wave, I think it's going to be difficult to really move ahead with plans for a significant convening here in Milwaukee,"" said Dr. John Raymond, president and CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Experts are concerned about bringing people from across the country into a single city for close interactions. Some states and cities may have the virus under control by August, while others may not.

""We have to put a bunch of people in the same place, the same city at the same time and that's really just asking for trouble because even if we reduce the number of people that come to the convention by 90%, it's still a lot more people in Charlotte than we normally have,"" said Ford.

""If you have infinite resources and a really good plan, it's possible,"" said Dr. James Conway, an infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Global Health Institute. He recommended testing attendees and workers at the convention site and other businesses, along with screening for temperatures, frequent and thorough cleaning of event spaces, ""abundant"" hand sanitizer, social distancing and masks.

""The testing literally has to be, 'Are you shedding the virus right now?' and doing that on a reliable basis, at least at the beginning, and ideally you would do it every day."" Conway said. ""Anybody with a fever gets turned around and asked to leave and then goes and gets tested.""

But mass testing and other precautions could come at a huge cost and might pull resources away from state and local officials. Barrett suggested Congress should provide funding to help cover health costs related to both conventions, as they do for security.

CONVENTIONS COULD BE ""STIMULUS PACKAGE"" FOR BUSINESSES

In the past, convention week has been a boon for local businesses in the host city. The Democratic National Convention generated $230.9 million for Philadelphia in 2016 and brought in nearly $164 million for Charlotte in 2012, a record for a single event held in the city.

According to a report by the 2012 Tampa Bay Host committee, the Republican National Convention that year produced $214 million for the city, about $25 million more than the 2016 RNC generated for Cleveland.

The Democratic National Convention was part of a series of events that would put Milwaukee ""on the big stage with bright lights,"" said Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. In addition to the convention, the Ryder Cup is supposed to take place about an hour outside of the city, and the Milwaukee Bucks were a favorite to make the NBA finals.

""The big stage and bright lights — those lights are flickering,"" Sheehy said. ""They haven't gone out, but they're clearly flickering.""

Some businesses were banking on a boost from the convention to keep their budgets afloat, like the Middle C Jazz club in Charlotte. It had only been open for four months before it closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The RNC to Middle C would be a stimulus package [of] far greater value than anything that we could get through the government to help us survive as a new important business in Charlotte,"" said Larry Farber, the club's managing director.

Despite the potential economic benefit, most small business owners agree that health and safety are paramount. They're waiting for public health guidance on how they should proceed.

Ben Hebl, who owns Pourman's, a bar in downtown Milwaukee, has furloughed his 11 employees and closed his bar due to COVID-19. Even a small scale convention would ""cushion the blow,"" he says. But Hebl is worried about the risks that could come with people traveling to Milwaukee.

""I wish more than anything we could have it,"" Hebl said. ""If people started dying, I would be upset that we made that decision because I don't value money over human lives.""

North Carolina-based businessman Eric Burg insisted that there is ""absolutely a way"" to conduct a convention in August, by taking precautions, like using LED-sanitized stations. The event side of Burg's company, Apple Rock Displays, has seen an 80% loss in revenue due to COVID-19 but his team stayed afloat by making PPE, including face shields and masks for businesses.

""There are ways to do this and everyone knows how to do it,"" Burg said. ""You just have to conquer your fear and be able to get comfortable with it.""

804,1519,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-plandemic-video-super-viral-brighteon-facebook-banning-cleansing-content-wuhan-coronavirus.html,2020-05-20,"After “Plandemic” video goes super viral on Brighteon.com, Facebook bans all Brighteon links, regardless of content","(Natural News) Facebook has initiated a whole new level of tyranny and censorship to try to eliminate any information about the Wuhan coronavirus that disagrees with the World Health Organization, which is largely run by communist China and is currently led by a former member of a violent communist group.

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Watch my recent interview with Dr. Judy Mikovits to find out why globalists are so afraid of this woman that they are blacklisting entire platforms to prevent her voice from being heard:

Will MLB's 67-page safety and health protocol keep players safe?,"St. Louis Cardinals All-Star shortstop Paul DeJong pored over the 67-page health and safety proposal Major League Baseball sent to players during the weekend, was mesmerized by the exhaustive details and was left with one question.

No sunflower seeds?

“I think it’s a great protocol with everyone getting tested every day,’’ DeJong told USA TODAY Sports. “But once we get past that, and into the season, I think things should get back to normal. I just feel like if we pass the exam and the daily testing, we should act freely in the clubhouse and on the field, and have fun.

“You can’t change having guys holding runners on first base. How about the catcher and the umpire and the batter all together at the plate? You can’t high-five?

“And I can’t even think about no sunflower seeds. That’s such a minimal risk.’’

This will be baseball in 2020, although it may feel more like a boot camp. Players are being advised to shower only at home or in their hotel rooms. No more buffets at the ballpark. No restaurants or bars on the road. No use of swimming pools or saunas. And don’t you dare let a soul into your hotel room outside immediate family members.

“I know we need testing protocols and assurances we’re OK,’’ DeJong says, “but I don’t know how sustainable all these ideas are. Some of these things are crazy, and are hard to enforce.

“This could be an infrastructure nightmare. It’s not going to be perfect right away, but guys have to ride with it.’’

READY TO GO:How 'insane' lifestyle has ignited Casey Mize's rise through baseball, soon to Tigers

MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association are scheduled to resume negotiations this week, with perhaps the biggest hurdle being economic as owners ask the players to assume part of the financial risk of playing with no fans. There is hard deadline for negotiations to conclude, but the hope still is that at least 82 regular-season games can be played beginning by the July 4th weekend with a record 14 teams qualifying for the postseason in October.

“I want to play, we all want to play,’’ DeJong says, “and I’m pretty optimistic now this is going to happen. With all this going on, we won’t take any unnecessary risk, but we’d all rather be out there than sitting home and sulking.

“We’ll be fine once we agree to a reasonable plan.’’

Still, no matter how many protocols, there will always be risk playing during the coronavirus pandemic. MLB to keep clubhouses, dugouts and other areas at ballparks disinfected as much as possible, but renowned chemist Lawrence Rocks, whose son is DeJong's agent, Burton Rocks, cautions that even cleaning solutions could be hazardous.

“The vapors from the ammonia and chlorine compounds, which are used in industrial cleaning, if used excessively, as with any overdose, can cause cilia damage in mucus membranes,’’ Rocks told USA TODAY Sports, ""and can actually have the effect of making a person more susceptible to virus or bacterial infection. These chemicals, which are often used in a deep clean of a building, can cause loss of oxygen transport in deep lung tissue, which takes the edge off a player considerably.

“Thus, any cleaning of any ballpark locker room, or any hotel room where a player lives, which is necessary given the transmissibility of COVID-19, needs to be done under OSHA standards, and with full knowledge that an elite athlete so as not to over-use the cleaners.”

DeJong, 26, a biochemistry and pre-science major at Illinois State who graduated with a 3.74 GPA, understands the health risks more than most of his peers. His own agent is a high-risk candidate, surviving three code blues as an infant with asthma.

Rocks said when fans are permitted to attend games, teams should forget about bobblehead day and instead have “Activated Carbon Mask’’ giveaways. And in the meantime, clubs should send the masks to season-ticket holders as a goodwill gesture, Burton Rocks and DeJong said.

“Right now, we have to protect our kids,’’ Burton Rocks said. “I think it’s a great opportunity for teams to jump on this. Who knows, a little kid may be inspired to invent the next vaccine?’’

DeJong, whose 74 homers in his first three seasons trail only future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols in Cardinals history, is fascinated how this season will play out. It’ll be a season like no other. Forget the age-old mantra; it’s now a sprint and not a marathon.

Losing streaks may blow up a season. Slumps will feel endless. The separator in this truncated season, DeJong said, may be the mental edge.

“I want to be ready because it’s going to be an adjustment,’’ DeJong said. “This shortened season will really test ourselves with all of the anxiety. You can’t look at it like, 'Oh, we just lost four in a row, and now we’re 3½ games back.’ You start thinking about those things, and it brings on an intense state. You have to be fearless, and trust yourself, staying in the moment as much as you can.’’

DeJong already started devising ways to rejuvenate his body and mind. He has been practicing cymatics, the study of sound and vibration. He meditates in the mornings and listening to soothing music while his mattress and pillow vibrate, the pain and stress washed away by sound. He calls it a mental reset.

He is religiously watching the Food Network, particularly proud of his steak au poivre. And he has immersed himself into books, and no, not one is about sports, let alone having anything to do with baseball.

He said he is reading five books these days, hoping to finish all by the resumption of spring training in June.

Let’s see, there’s “Sacred Geometry and Architecture’’ by Arturo Ponce de Leon, “Magnet Therapy Theory and Practice’’ by Bengali C. Neville, “An Esoteric Cosmology,’’ by Rudolf Steiner, “The wellspring of Good’’ by Beinsa Douno and “Holographic Blood’’ by Harvey Bigelsen.

Yeah, just your typical assortment of reading material by one of the game’s youngest stars.

“I like to read all kinds of random stuff,’’ DeJong says. “I’m really interested in magnets now, how we have our magnetic fields as humans. There can be imbalances in our own magnetic fields, and that can be rectified in therapy, using magnets to balance yourself.

“I’m a very big picture person, and I’m just trying to get all of these disciplines and bringing them together.’’

The reward is a World Series championship, and even if this season tramples all tradition, playing 82 games with no fans in the stands, no high-fives, no Gatorade bath, no sunflower seeds, this season may be forever cherished in baseball history.

“The asterisk may live in the mind of the fan, but none of us will consider it like that,’’ DeJong says. “We’re all competing on the same field under the same rules.

“I think with all of the sacrifices everyone will be making will make it that much more personal. The games could get more intense. The season will mean so much to so many people.

“You win the World Series after enduring this, no one will forget it.",real
809,356,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html,2020-04-17,W.H.O. Failed to Tell Syrian Kurds of Their First Coronavirus Death: Live Coverage,"
This briefing has ended. Read global live updates on the coronavirus here.新冠病毒疫情最新消息
Syria’s Kurdish northeast had its first Covid-19 death. The case was news to the Kurds.
The Kurdish-led administration that governs northeastern Syria announced on Friday the first death in that region from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As it turns out, the World Health Organization knew about the case for more than 11 days before informing the local authorities, a W.H.O. official said.
The W.H.O. official and the Kurdish administration, which oversees about one-third of Syria’s territory along the Turkish and Iraqi borders, said a 53-year-old man was admitted to a hospital on March 27. Doctors ran a test for the coronavirus and sent it to the Syrian capital, Damascus, for analysis.
The man died on April 2, the same day that his test came back positive. The authorities in Damascus, which has a hostile relationship with the Kurds, did not pass along that information.
The W.H.O. official, Rick Brennan, the regional emergency director for the eastern Mediterranean, said in an interview that the Syrian authorities informed the organization of  the case on April 5, but because of “internal procedural problems and miscommunication,” it did not get word to the Kurds about it until Thursday — 11 days later.
The case illustrates how the political divisions left by Syria’s long civil war could hinder a response if a major outbreak occurs. The government of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus controls most of the country, but has hostile relations with both the Kurdish-led administration that governs the northeast and the leaders of a rebel-held enclave in Idlib Province in the northwest.
Syria has reported only 38 cases of coronavirus and two deaths, but aid groups have warned that the virus could do great damage. Millions of Syrians have been displaced and impoverished through nine years of war, and much of the country’s health infrastructure has been badly damaged.
In a statement Friday, the Kurdish-led administration said it would hold the W.H.O. responsible if the virus spread in its area.
Mr. Brennan said that the man who died had no travel history and no known contact with other infected people — indicating that there are almost certainly other, undiagnosed cases in the area.
Germany’s infection rate falls, a sign that it is getting the virus under control.
As Germany moves to ease restrictions under the pandemic, its public health institute said the country’s rate of coronavirus spread had dropped below a crucial threshold, a sign that the contagion was coming under control.
On average, each infected person is spreading the virus to 0.7 other people, officials said. That means that fewer people are catching the virus than are getting over it.
As long as the figure stays below one, the number of active cases is declining, and the burden on the health care system is easing.
“Since April 12, we have recorded more recoveries than new infections,” Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said at a news conference on Friday. “That is an important and encouraging development.”
Scientists around the world have estimated that without social distancing, quarantines of the ill and other precautions, each person with the new virus would give it to about two others — a formula for exponential growth.
This week, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the first steps to ease restrictions, allowing some stores to reopen on Monday and high school students to return to classrooms to prepare for or take exams. The eastern state of Saxony is requiring  people who go out in public to cover their noses and mouths either with masks or a shawl.
The lower infection rate does not mean that Germans can return to their pre-coronavirus lifestyles, said Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the government’s public health and epidemiology center.
He cautioned that in some parts of Germany, the infection rate remained much higher, and stressed that the rate is only one point in a range of data being continually assessed to make decisions on regulation of public life.
“This virus is in our country, and it will remain in our country,” Dr. Wieler said. And the situation, he said, “can change at any time.”

The U.N. warns of the pandemic’s ‘potentially catastrophic’ impact on the world’s children.
While children have been largely spared the worst of the Covid-19 illness, the United Nations has warned that the social and economic fallout of the pandemic “risk being catastrophic and amongst the most lasting consequences” for the young.
In a new report, researchers found that as schools remain closed, families lose income, food resources become harder to secure and the health needs of children go unmet, hundreds of thousands of children could die and millions could be plunged into poverty.
“I appeal to families everywhere, and leaders at all levels: protect our children,” the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in a video statement announcing the report.
The report, released on Thursday, found that the pandemic was turning into “a broader child-rights crisis” that would play out unevenly around the world.
“All children, of all ages, and in all countries, are affected,” it said. “However, some children are destined to bear the greatest costs.” The report cited “children in the poorest countries, and in the poorest neighborhoods, and for those in already disadvantaged or vulnerable situations.”
“Polio vaccination campaigns have been suspended. Measles immunization campaigns have stopped in at least 23 countries,” according to the report. “And as health services become overwhelmed, sick children are less able to access care.”
Infant mortality is likely to rise, the report said. School closures reduce many children’s nutrition and safety. Mr. Guterres said that 310 million schoolchildren, nearly half of the world’s total, rely on schools as a daily source of food.
In addition, with children at home and families under increasing stress, he said, “children are both victims and witnesses of domestic violence and abuse.”
U.S. roundup: Trump encourages protests against some state restrictions.
President Trump on Friday openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables.
In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his announcement on Thursday night suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.
Mr. Trump’s call for liberation from social distancing rules followed protests around the country as protesters — many wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats — congregated in packed groups around state capitols to demand that restrictions be immediately lifted and to demonize their Democratic governors.
The tweets contrasted with his message on Thursday, when he told governors  “you’re going to call your own shots,” and said that reopening would proceed “one careful step at a time.”
After saying repeatedly that there was plenty of testing — a claim many governors, like health experts, have refuted — Mr. Trump tweeted, “the States have to step up their TESTING!”
Canada’s big annual party will go virtual, the government said.
This year’s celebration of Canada Day in Ottawa will — like so many occasions derailed by the coronavirus — take place as an online-only affair, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Friday.
Often referred to as the nation’s birthday, Canada Day, July 1, is one of the country’s major national holidays, and ordinarily draws crowds from across the country to Ottawa, the capital.
A concert stage is built in front of the Parliament buildings for performances by musicians, actors and comedians throughout the day and evening, and the program culminates in a fireworks show. Other events are held elsewhere in the city and across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Quebec.
This year, the main stage was to be in a park because of construction work in front of the Parliament buildings.
Steven Guilbeault, the minister of Canadian Heritage, said on Friday that the government will work with artists and performers to come up with a virtual approximation of the celebrations.
“Together, we are meeting one of the greatest challenges in our history, and this year more than ever, Canada Day will highlight the strength that unites us,” Mr. Guilbeault said.
Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly suggested that restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place for at least several more weeks and perhaps months.
Summer is a key time for celebrations and festivals in Canada where the season is relatively brief. Quebec, effectively canceled summer last week by announcing that all indoor and outdoor festivals, cultural events and most sports events would be canceled until the end of August.
Canada Day marks the date in 1867 when three British provinces were united as a largely independent Dominion of Canada, with its own Parliament.
Americans and Europeans tell of harassment in India, where foreigners are blamed for contagion.
Julie Price, an American living in India, was trying to buy food. But when she reached a grocery store in the city of Hyderabad late last month, a guard blocked her from entering. A bystander took her picture, said that foreigners were not allowed in and threatened to call the police.
A crowd had gathered, and she rushed home.“I was so scared that I did not leave my apartment for 20 days,” said Ms. Price, a Tennessee native who arrived in India in January for a long work trip. Her experience is not unusual.
In recent weeks, Americans and Europeans in India have been evicted from hotels and apartments, aggressively questioned on the streets and forced to ration food in remote beach towns amid what appears to be a rise in xenophobic incidents during the pandemic. Many of India’s initial cases emerged from foreign travelers, and some South Asians believe that Westerners carry the coronavirus.
After India declared a nationwide lockdown on March 24, shutting most shops and halting international flights, Ms. Price, who runs a branch of her graphic design business from Hyderabad, hunkered down in a rented apartment.
“This is the first time I’ve ever been treated rudely here,” Ms. Price said. “It really upset me. I have to eat, too.”
This week, after her story spread in Hyderabad, the police showed up at her apartment and offered to escort her to the store. A manager there apologized and offered Ms. Price his personal number.
Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat, a police commissioner in Hyderabad, said the incident was under investigation. He said Indians who blocked others from buying food on the basis of nationality or ethnicity would be met with an “iron fist.”
“The police do not tolerate this and legal action will be taken,” he said.The latest in science: Medical ingenuity is abounding where ventilators aren’t.
As the coronavirus rages across the globe, ventilators that pump oxygen into the lungs of critically ill patients have been embraced as the best hope for saving lives.
In the United States, fears of ventilator shortages have unleashed a wave of experimentation  that is leading to some promising alternatives to help sustain patients.
Some hospitals have been using CPAP and BiPAP machines, designed for people with sleep apnea, to keep coronavirus patients breathing without having to resort to intubations and ventilators. Engineers have transformed hooded hair salon dryers into personal negative pressure chambers that deliver oxygen and limit the spread of aerosolized virus, lowering the infection risks for health care workers and other patients.
Pulmonologists across the country have been turning to a remarkably simple intervention: flipping patients onto their stomachs, which markedly improves oxygen levels for those in respiratory distress.
Doctors say these and other ad hoc interventions have allowed many hospitals to weather the surge of desperately ill patients in recent weeks, and may have helped stave off the dire ventilator shortages and rationing that some had feared.
“Some of these are battlefield interventions that we would not normally use in hospitals, but this crisis has been an incredible spur for creativity and collaboration,” said Dr. Greg Martin, a pulmonologist in Atlanta and the president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. “The beauty of this is that we’re learning a lot and hopefully some of this will translate to things we can use in the future.”
France weighs digital tracking against liberty in its fight against the virus.
As France sought clues last month on how to tame the coronavirus, experts looked at one tool that has been central to the strategy of some Asian nations: digital tracking. Citing threats to “individual liberties,” the powerful interior minister dismissed it as alien to “French culture.”
But three weeks later — and after a tenfold spike in deaths — French culture could be changing. President Emmanuel Macron, who this week extended a nationwide lockdown by at least another month, said his government was considering using a smartphone tracking app that would inform people if they have come in contact with an infected person.
Such steps are particularly fraught in Europe, the continent with the world’s toughest online privacy rules. But as the country struggles to find a way out of a lockdown that is entering its second month and has kept a population of 67 million confined to their homes and paralyzed its economy, options that once seemed unfathomable have steadily become more palatable.
Recent experience in Asia shows that comprehensive tracing of infection chains, along with aggressive testing, has proved critical to fighting the pandemic. And the situation is calling into question a host of Western assumptions, including about the use of digital tracking and the wearing of face masks.
Those in France who argue in favor of allowing the app’s intrusiveness say that it is fair to infringe on people who are infected rather than inhibit the freedom of society as a whole. But there are concerns that the app, relying mainly on a sense of civic duty, will be so watered down in France that it will prove ineffective.
A judge rules that Mexico must extend its coronavirus measures to migrants.The Mexican government was ordered to extend its coronavirus protections to migrants in a ruling made public on Friday.
The ruling said health care should be guaranteed to people who were detained and that temporary residency status be given to people determined to be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Reuters reported.
The order also said the government would have to identify symptomatic detainees, report the number of migrants who were detained and release members of vulnerable populations. Migrants are also to have accessible information on ways to protect themselves.
Mexico, which has more than 6,200 cases and nearly 500 deaths from the virus, first declared a health emergency on March 30 — after initial resistance. The ruling came after advocacy groups claimed the government had not been adequately protecting migrants and asylum seekers. Mexico had more than double the number of asylum requests last year than it did in 2018.
With businesses closed to slow the spread of the virus in the country, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that next month $2.5 billion would be distributed to support the economy. Mr. López Obrador did not specify how the money would be sent, but said that there would be three million loans to small businesses.
Beijing finds that messages that work at home can backfire abroad.
China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has used the coronavirus pandemic to shore up his political power at home, but the tools the Communist Party has exploited to do this are threatening China’s international standing.
Internationally, China has demanded praise of Mr. Xi from countries receiving its experts and supplies, and has vented at the world a vitriol usually reserved for domestic audiences, provoking anger.
China’s embassy in France posted a statement on its website accusing Western governments of failing to protect their most vulnerable, letting nursing home residents die abandoned. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman floated a conspiracy theory that Americans might have introduced the virus to China.
In the past week, officials in France, Britain and nearly two dozen African nations have rebuked Chinese government actions. China has been accused of hypocrisy, hubris and obfuscating the virus’s origins.
Japan has pledged to help companies move production out of China because of concerns about the country’s reliability. And President Emmanuel Macron of France questioned whether China’s heavy-handed methods were a model for democracies to follow.
China’s state media portray Mr. Xi as a forceful yet benevolent leader, and in calls with world leaders, he emphasizes global unity and China’s willingness to help. In Beijing’s official accounts of those calls, other leaders praise him effusively.
While lashing out at anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, China has turned a blind eye  to —  and even, critics say, encouraged — xenophobia at home. China has restricted entry from abroad, allowing it to portray the danger as a foreign one, even though many of those returning from other countries were Chinese citizens.
The European Union’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, recently accused China of stoking a “battle of the narratives” and stigmatizing Europeans. After member nations complained about substandard medical supplies bought from China, the bloc made a point of thanking Taiwan for its donation of masks, a gesture that would previously have been considered too risky for fear of offending Beijing.
A general defies a government order, creating tensions in Sudan.
A dispute over measures to counter the coronavirus in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, has led to an open confrontation between the country’s military and political leaders, underscoring the fragility of the country’s transition to democracy.
The civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, announced on Thursday that he had fired the governor of Khartoum, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abdoun Hamad, for defying a government order to cancel Friday prayers in Khartoum and its sister city across the Nile, Omdurman.
Like many African countries, Sudan has a relatively low incidence of coronavirus — 32 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus — but officials fear that a larger outbreak would quickly overwhelm the country’s dilapidated health system.
But General Hamad refused the prime minister’s order, saying in a statement issued by his office hours later that he intended to remain in his position — an unusually public act of defiance that exposed a growing rift inside the ruling Supreme Council, which is composed of civilians and army generals and is supposed to lead the country toward democratic elections in 2022.
The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated those tensions. After a jump in confirmed cases this week, the government canceled Friday prayers and announced a three-week lockdown set to take effect on Saturday.
In defiance of those orders, a group of protesters massed outside the army headquarters on Thursday to call for the ouster of Mr. Hamdok’s government. “No to the government of hunger,” read one sign.
Hours later, as the confrontation with the Khartoum governor, General Hamad, unfolded, senior Sudanese civilian officials contacted Western officials and local journalists to warn that they feared the military would use the coronavirus lockdown to seize power while the outside world was distracted by the public health crisis. Several Western officials, though, said there was little sign of an imminent power grab.
European car sales plummeted in March.
New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.
New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.
Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.
Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.
German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.
More than 1,000 French sailors from the Charles de Gaulle carrier group have tested positive. So far.
Nearly half of the roughly 2,300 sailors from France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier group have tested positive for the coronavirus, the French defense minister said on Friday, amid growing questions over the military’s handling of the outbreak.
“It’s an issue that keeps me up at night,” the minister, Florence Parly, told a video hearing of  the defense committee of France’s lower house of Parliament.
The Charles de Gaulle, France’s flagship nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, returned to its Mediterranean home port of Toulon on Sunday, after the outbreak emerged. There were 1,760 sailors aboard the carrier itself, Ms. Parly said, and several hundred more on support vessels, including a frigate and a refueling ship.
Almost all the sailors have been tested, Ms. Parly, with 1,081 testing positive and results pending for another 929. Nearly 550 sailors are symptomatic, she said, and 24 are hospitalized in Toulon, one in intensive care.
The carrier’s outbreak recalls the one on the U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which became a debacle for the U.S. Navy.
“We hear the doubts, we hear the questions, there are many on the origin of the contamination,” Ms. Parly acknowledged at the hearing. She said that medical and military investigations were seeking to determine how the outbreak started and whether it was adequately handled, and that the conclusions would be made public.
One hypothesis, Ms. Parly said, is that the outbreak was tied to a mid-March stop in Brest, on France’s Atlantic coast. Traditional family visits to the ship were canceled, she said, but sailors were allowed to disembark.
Ms. Parly forcefully denied media reports earlier this week suggesting that the defense ministry had denied a request by the carrier’s commander to end the mission on the stopover in Brest, which lasted from March 13 to 16, just before France went on lockdown to stop the spread of the virus.
In Denmark, pupils go back to school in ‘a new world.’
On Wednesday, 350 pupils returned to classes at the Logumkloster District School for the first time in a month, as Denmark became the first country in the Western world to reopen its elementary schools since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The move has turned the Danish education system into a laboratory for whether and how schools can function in an age of contagion.
“It is a new world,” said Tanja Linnet, the school’s head teacher, as pupils arrived on Thursday morning. “We used to make plans for if there was a terrorist attack here, but never this kind of attack.”
To stop the spread of infection, parents were not allowed inside. Teachers were not allowed to gather in the staff room. The children each had their own desks, two yards away from their nearest neighbor. During recess, they could play only in small groups. And by the time the school shut at 2 p.m., they had all washed their hands at least once an hour.
“We usually jump and hug and fight and give each other high fives,” said Zakarias Al-Tibi, 10, pointing at his best friend, Jannik. “But we can’t do that anymore.”
The World Health Organization has cautioned against reopening societies too quickly for fear of reviving the pandemic before it can be stamped out. The number of active cases in Denmark has dipped in recent days; it has recorded more than 7,000 infections and 336 deaths.
Many parents are conflicted. Some created Facebook groups protesting the reopening of schools, fearing that their children were being sacrificed to save the Danish economy. But by and large, parents at Logumkloster have been won over by how the head teacher and her staff refitted the school for safety.
China revises its figures in Wuhan, adding 50 percent more deaths.
Faced with mounting skepticism over its official figures, China on Friday revised upward its death toll in the city where the coronavirus first emerged.
Officials placed the new tally at 3,869 deaths from the coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, an increase of 1,290, or 50 percent, from the previous figure. The number of confirmed infections in the city was also revised upward to 50,333, an increase of 325.
Officials in Wuhan said the revised death toll included those who died at home in the early days of the outbreak, as well as deaths that had not been properly reported by hospitals or registered on death certificates.
The move appeared to be a response to growing questions about the accuracy of China’s official numbers and calls to hold the country responsible for what has become a global health crisis. Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, told Reuters on Thursday that China would have to answer “hard questions” after the crisis about how the pandemic came about and how it could have been stopped earlier. President Emmanuel Macron of France told The Financial Times that “there are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”
The C.I.A. has also told the White House that China’s official figures are vastly understated, though it does not know the exact numbers, current and former American intelligence officials say.
Widespread reporting has shown that the Chinese authorities initially mismanaged and concealed the extent of the epidemic before eventually swinging into action in late January to halt the spread of the virus. Beijing maintains that it has been transparent in its communications about the epidemic from the beginning.
Epidemiologists still don’t know the worldwide death rate for Covid-19.
Coroners in some areas are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in virus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people this year in some countries, including the United States, than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists.As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
The rates vary widely by geography. In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths, while in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died.
But all of those percentages have a basic flaw: No one really knows how many people have the virus. Counting deaths has been far from perfect, but it is easier than counting infections, and some countries are doing far more testing than others.
In other words, it is not clear what the apparently varying death rates around the world really mean.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others.
Ireland to increase its W.H.O. funding after Trump’s plan to halt aid.
In response to President Trump’s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization, Ireland said on Thursday that it would quadruple its annual contribution to the public health agency.
Simon Coveney, the country’s foreign minister, said that Ireland “strongly supports” the organization’s effort to lead the global response to the coronavirus and would contribute 9.5 million euros, about $10.2 million, this year toward that mission.
“So many countries rely on United Nations expertise and capacity to save lives,” he wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would freeze funding to the health organization while his administration reviewed its handling of the crisis, accusing it of promoting disinformation about the scale of the disease’s threat.
Critics say the Trump administration was slow to take the pandemic seriously and lagged on facilitating wide-scale testing to help fight the outbreak.
The United States is the largest funder to the W.H.O., and last year contributed about $553 million of the agency’s $6 billion budget.
The decision to suspend funding provoked criticism from other countries, with officials warning that pulling support from an already underfunded agency could have severe consequences. And nations declared their continued support.
Britain also said it would continue to fund the organization, which it says has an important role in the response to the outbreak. “It is a global challenge, and it’s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat,” a Downing Street spokesman said on Wednesday.
In Spain, calls to ‘free’ the children intensify under a strict lockdown.
Most children in Spain haven’t been outside in five weeks. Unlike in France, Britain and even Italy, children are forbidden to even take a short walk on the street or exercise near their homes.
Such confinement measures, the most stringent in Europe, have left parents, health experts and politicians alarmed over the potentially harmful consequences that the confinement will have on children’s physical and mental health.
“If adults can go for a walk with a dog, and now some nonessential economic activities are resuming, why do our boys and girls have to keep waiting?” Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, wrote on Facebook, urging the authorities to “free our children.”
Calls to ease the lockdown for children have intensified in recent days, and the Madrid region may allow children under 14 to go out for an hour once a day by the end of the month.
Confinement can lead to eating and sleeping disorders, depression and aggressive conduct, among other troubles, child experts say, all of which can have a critical impact on a young person’s development. The ban on going outside has been worse for children who live in cramped apartments without a balcony or outdoor space.
Parents have reported that their children have lost interest in activities, cried a lot or become apathetic, and some in Spain who have tried to take their children out for a short walk said the young ones have refused.
“I think I’m just afraid of the street now,” Lia Cenador, 9, said of her refusal to go out after her mother offered her a chance to breathe some fresh air in Barcelona. “I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be on the streets.”
Singapore records another daily high, linked to crowded migrant dorms.
Singapore announced a record jump in coronavirus cases for the second day in a row on Thursday, with most of the 728 new infections coming from crowded dormitories for migrant laborers.
The rise was a stark demonstration of the risks faced by low-wage migrants who have built the modern city-state, bringing focus to their poor living conditions. More than 1,050 cases were linked to the residences on Wednesday and Thursday, leading the government to promise changes in how the migrants, many from India and Bangladesh, are treated.
While Singapore has been praised for its rigorous contact-tracing program, which quickly identified clusters of local transmissions, the coronavirus spread rapidly through dormitories for foreign laborers, where up to 20 people are crammed in each room with shared kitchens and bathrooms.
The health ministry said on Thursday that the surge in newly identified cases was in line with its “continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers.”
After weeks of low transmission numbers, Singapore began recording a rapid rise in cases in March, as travelers from Europe and the United States brought the virus with them. By Thursday, the health ministry said it had not registered any imported cases for a week.
Israel begins mapping out a ‘controlled’ reopening.
Israel is readying a “pilot program” to ease back into normal life, beginning with the “controlled and measured” reopening of businesses in certain sectors, but officials still need to hash out details, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
With more than a million Israelis idle — the unemployment rate is 26 percent — Mr. Netanyahu said the finance ministry was mapping out a plan to allow select businesses to resume operations and would bring it to his cabinet for approval on Saturday night.
Some special-education students will also be able to restart private lessons, and people will be permitted to exercise within a 500-meter radius of their homes. Until now, Israelis had been constrained to 100 meters from their front doors.
The announcement came hours after about 1,000 people protested on Thursday night in Tel Aviv against Mr. Netanyahu, the indicted head of a caretaker right-wing government. The demonstration prompted Mr. Netanyahu’s son Yair to write on Twitter that he hoped that “the elderly people who die following this protest” were left-wingers. He later deleted the post.
Separately, Muslim officials said that Al-Aqsa mosque would remain closed throughout Ramadan, the monthlong holiday that begins on April 23.
China’s economy shrinks for the first time since 1976.
The coronavirus outbreak has brought China’s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end — a stark reminder of the enormous task ahead for world leaders trying to restart the global economy.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the country’s economic output shrank 6.8 percent from January through March compared with the same period last year. It is the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution, a national spasm of urban violence and torture.
The numbers reflect China’s dramatic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.
China is now trying to restart its vast, $14 trillion economy, an effort that could give the rest of the world a much-needed shot in the arm. But the spread of the virus to Europe and the United States has sharply cut the world’s appetite for China’s goods. That could lead to factory shutdowns and worker furloughs.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics confirmed last month that domestic industrial production, retail sales and investment all suffered record double-digit drops in the first two months of this year compared with the same period of 2019.
“This year is difficult — some have lost their jobs, some cannot find work to do,” said Liu Xia, a fruit vendor from a village on the outskirts of Beijing. “Those who do go to work and those who are still in business are greatly affected.”
Beijing’s options for dealing with the crisis are limited. Its economy has become too big and complex to easily restart as it did in 2008 when it unveiled a plan to spend more than half a trillion dollars. And years of easy lending have left local governments and state-run companies mired in debt.
Nairobi’s governor falsely touts Cognac as a coronavirus cure.
The latest fake cure for the coronavirus making the rounds: drinking Cognac. This week, Mike Mbuvi Sonko, the governor of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, included small bottles of the alcoholic drink as part of care packages delivered to the city’s poor.
Mr. Sonko, who is known for his flamboyant lifestyle and was arrested last year over a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal, falsely argued that research by the World Health Organization had shown that alcohol played a “very major role” in killing the coronavirus.
Cognac, which he said would be distributed only to adults, “should act as a throat sanitizer. It kills the virus,” he said in a video while wearing sunglasses, a mask, a cap and a shield.
The local operation of Hennessy, the French Cognac distiller, rebutted Mr. Sonko’s claim in a statement, saying that its alcoholic beverages do not protect against the virus. The company urged people to wash their hands, practice social distancing and stay at home.
As with other regions, myths and fake news about the virus and how to fight it have been circulating across Africa, with many shared widely through social media and applications like WhatsApp. The purported treatments have included drinking black tea with no sugar in Kenya, shaving beards in Nigeria and boiling and drinking aidan fruits in Ghana. The authorities in Burundi have cited divine intervention to explain the delayed arrival of the virus in the continent. In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has declined to close churches during the pandemic, saying that the coronavirus “cannot survive in the body of Christ; it will burn.”
As of Thursday, there were 17,247 cases and 910 deaths from the coronavirus across Africa, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ellis Marsalis, jazz pianist, educator, and patriarch of the Marsalis family, has died at the age of 85. His death was announced in tweets from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Jazz at Lincoln Center, where his son Wynton is managing and artistic director.

Obituaries 'Morning Edition' On Ellis Marsalis Patriarch Of New Orleans Musical Family, Ellis Marsalis, Dies At 85 Listen · 3:28 3:28

He reportedly went into the hospital over the weekend with symptoms of pneumonia. The New York Times reports that his son Branford says the cause of death was complications from COVID-19.

Ellis Louis Marsalis Jr. was born on Nov. 14, 1934. He graduated from Dillard University in New Orleans with a B.A. in music education, and that was the field to which he devoted himself. Despite playing with such notable jazz musicians as Cannonball and Nat Adderley, he was most proud of his work as an educator. His music students included Terence Blanchard, Donald Harrison, Harry Connick Jr. and four of his sons: Wynton, Branford, Delfeayo and Jason Marsalis.

Ellis Marsalis taught at the first full-time public arts high school in New Orleans, the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, where he instructed students on the harsh realities of pursuing a career in the arts.

The former Marine put it this way to NPR in 1985: ""There is no such thing as fair. The world's not fair, it's not about being fair.""

The US has the highest number of coronavirus cases as, according to data presented by the Johns Hopkins University, 1.7 million Americans have been infected.

US President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf at one of his family-owned resorts outside of Washington DC, in a move that US media outlets suggest is a signal to the public that it is right for the United States to return to normal activities amid the coronavirus pandemic, even in areas that are the hardest hit by the deadly disease. A photojournalist caught the moment as Trump left the White House for the resort.

​This was the first time that the 73-year-old Trump has engaged in his favorite leisure pastime since 8 March.

In another sign that Trump wants the country to reopen as a means of boosting business activity, the US president has resumed travelling across the country. This month he visited Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, key swing states in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. On 22 May, Trump called on US state governors to reopen houses of worship – churches, temples, synagogues and mosques, which are currently shuttered to assist in slowing the spread of the disease. The president claims that lifting the health measures are essential, declaring: “in America, we need more prayer, not less” and threatening to override governors who refuse to do as he demands.

Trump, in the middle of a deadly and ongoing pandemic, has been actively promoting to reopen the United States solely as a means of bolstering the country’s economy, which has sustained severe losses during the lockdowns. Almost 39 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since the country introduced safety measures to slow the spread of the virus. All states have made limited reopenings after a two-month shutdown, with various degrees of restrictions.",fake

Evolutionary Epidemiologist Dr Rob Wallace authored Big Farms Make Big Flu: Dispatches on Infectious Disease, Agribusiness, and the Nature of Science in 2016, which predicted an escalation in global pandemics like those caused by Swine Flu, SARS and MERS. His work involves analysing the historical and geographical basis for the origin and spread of viruses.

Dr Wallace received his Ph.D. in biology at the CUNY Graduate Center, and did post-doctorate work at the University of California, Irvine, with Walter Fitch, a founder of molecular phylogeny. He is a Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Global Studies, University of Minnesota and has consulted with the Food and Agriculture Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sputnik: What exactly is an evolutionary epidemiologist, and what is it that you specialise in?

Dr Rob Wallace: We all know that infectious diseases spread, but as they spread they also evolve. An evolutionary epidemiologist uses methods and concepts in population biology to describe how pathogens evolve in the course of diffusing across a landscape.

I specialise on applying principles in economic geography to explain how major threats such as avian and swine influenza, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-CoV-2 spread and evolve in response to the world as it presently is -- largely structured around circuits of capital and production.

Sputnik: Explain the main thesis of your book Big Farms Make Big Flu. How much of your work has predicted the emergence of something like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Dr Rob Wallace: It was only upon touring for my book back in 2017 that I thought through the best encapsulation of its thesis: As we industrialise the production of food, we also industrialise the pathogens that circulate among our livestock and crops. This mode of food production, producing, in livestock, cities of monoculture hog and chickens and other livestock and poultry around the world, is selecting for pathogens that are deadlier, more infectious, and of a wider diversity.

Now, that description accounts for pathogens that have made their way to the intensive farms within the spatial orbits of many a city. At the other end of regional production circuits, pathogens oft-spill directly from increasingly encroached-upon forests and the wild animals there, the reservoirs of exotic pathogens to which few humans have been exposed.

When we log, mine, or replace primary forest with plantation agriculture, we simplify the forest in such a way that deadly pathogens previously bottled up in wildlife are able to spring free.

Sputnik: You've co-authored an article arguing that the ""failure to prepare for and react"" to the COVID-19 outbreak have been decades in the making. Can you explain what you mean by this?

Dr Rob Wallace: Pandemics are mirrors. They tell a society its status. Over the past forty years, public health in the U.S., for instance, has been both neglected and monetised to the point that what was a social commons is largely individualised at the point of contact with insurance companies that may, or may not, pay for a treatment.

A pandemic pathogen doesn't subscribe to that model of intervention. Indeed, as we already see, COVID-19 is affecting the poorest and most oppressed to the point that it overloads health systems so that the health needs of everyone else other than the very richest are affected as well. For systems so interested in privatising every part of society, the most basic truisms of human community, such as the health of everyone is interconnected, are appearing such a shock.

The U.S.'s ruling class cannot recognise itself in the pandemic save in passing off the worst damage upon the 99%.

Sputnik: To what extent has the preparation for a global pandemic and handling of the current crisis been lacking?

Dr Rob Wallace: Upon bird flu H5N1 in 1997 and again in 2003, the various U.N. health agencies --WHO, [Food and Agriculture Organization], [International Organisation of Employers] -- put their territorialism aside and began to work together through how the health of wildlife, livestock, and humans are interconnected. So both the scientific community and many a health officer placed the possibility of a pandemic front and centre.

But governments worldwide treated every subsequent outbreak as some new and unconnected shock: SARS-1, H1N1 (2009), MERS, Ebola in West Africa and the Congo, Zika, and so on. Each outbreak was treated as an emergency at the expense of discussing and responding to the structural causes shared across the series of outbreaks.

There are many such causes, but the big one is treated as much a part of our world as gravity or the sun. Centres of capital the world over are funding deforestation and development on forest frontiers across the world, expanding the interface between animal disease reservoirs and newly placed livestock and the labour tending them.

An increasing diversity of pathogens are now spilling over and they have much clearer shot migrating out of the deepest forests to local regional capitals with easy access to the global travel network. But none of the public health staff are empowered to talk about or act upon the ""c-word"" driving these outbreaks. It is the unspeakable prime directive at the heart of global political economy. And so scientists are stuck with the impossible task of merely cleaning up after the epidemiological messes of the very system producing these outbreaks.

Sputnik: What, in your opinion, needs to be done in order to ensure the likelihood of future outbreaks is reduced as well as sufficiently mitigating against them when they do occur?

Dr Rob Wallace: Responding with proper programs in public health, including the right supply of hospital capacity and PPE [Personal Protection Equipment] and antivirals and employment insurance, are all necessary. Seems trite, but many of the richest industrial countries have flat-out failed in such basics. A lack of resources wasn't the problem. The political class's refusal to pay for them under the most Malthusian of justifications is the revulsion to blame.

Bigger picture, but not unrelated, we must also change our very way of social reproduction or how we reproduce our societies generation to generation. We must reintegrate humanity into the ecologies we share with other creatures in such a way that we accept, and respond to, the consequences of appropriating the resources we need to survive as a species. We must end expropriating land and labour to the point that capital can get away with externalising the worst costs of production -- climate change, pollution, labour morbidity, land grabs, declines in nutrition, and pandemics, among many other damage--onto everyone else. That selects for the utterly worst behaviours possible.

It's a sociopathic way of living that requires radical recalibration. Otherwise, given the scale of our present civilisation, we threaten to end society as we know it the world over. That might involve both the bang of a pandemic that kills a billion people and the whimper of drawn-out pulses in shifts in climate. We deserve better. We can use our brilliant collective minds and our everyday-apparent compassion to readjust our shared community to another mode of living entirely. Even in the face of what seem such terrible odds. We have no choice otherwise.

The numbers on the image correspond with the numbers in the article body.

1. This epidemic virus spread may be cancelled with a simple and very inexpensive decontamination kit that you can purchase most of the parts for at your local discount dollar shop. The materials mentioned in this article can help to stop infections from spreading by mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and hands by providing a personal protective barrier.

The Low Cost Viral Defense Kit

2. A clear plastic whole face mask can provide protection for your eyes, nose, ears and mouth. These are typically manufactured from plastic materials similar to common plastic bottles. They have a small opening at the mouth hole that allows for easy breathing, and this opening has protection with a respirator like filter to prevent virus inhalation or an antiviral imbedded filter respirator mask material for your safety.

3. Hoody jackets or parkas with hoods that pull tightly around the mask with elastics on the waist and wrist form a seal. These are manufactured with materials that are threaded with both copper and silver threads that kill viruses on contact.

4. Antiviral/anti-infectious gloves contain antiviral solutions bound right into the material. These gloves also have elasticated wrists for protection of hands and reduce the possibility of picking up unwanted germs.

5. Having a simple decontamination kit ready when you arrive at your destination will give you the ability to spray down the gloves, hoody and mask. Once sprayed with the antiviral, which should be packed waiting in a large bucket, store all materials in the container while not in use with a tightly sealed lid.

Infections can’t occur unless they are given an opportunity to penetrate the mucous membrane of the eyes, mouth, and nose. This simple low cost kit will help to reduce the spread of the coronavirus as well as other pathogens to keep the wearer safe.

Five minute PCR diagnostic testing

Airport surveillance for infectious disease is little more than TSA theater.

The coronavirus is reported to have an incubation period of eight days or more which means that an individual would not display symptoms early in the infection, and could transmit the virus to many others around him.

6. A more effective and intelligent means of identifying those at risk to themselves and others would be a rapid PCR test that only requires a swab against the cheek or tongue for a quick analysis within five minutes with an accuracy near 100%. This test and could be easily done prior to boarding and would ensure that no one on board would be transmitting viral particles to other passengers with the costs for such testing being very minimal.

Airlines as incubators

It’s been said that flying for hours with 300 strangers in the cabin is like spending an evening in a sewer pipe.

7. A readily available solution to this situation is to open all air vents to purge the cabin in-flight with fresh air, as currently almost all air in the cabin is recirculated including viral particles in the air making most flights the equivalent of biological gas chambers. There are commercially available viral filtration, ozonation and ionization devices that will fit into existing airline air conditioning systems to improve the quality of air, and reduce the risk of infection. Airlines have been reluctant to implement such public health measures due to increases in costs per flight.

Once on the ground airline cabins can be effectively disinfected by flushing the cabin air with a highly concentrated blast of ozone and ions which will seek out and bond to all biological compounds. Currently there are ion generators available at low costs.

Innovative Therapeutics

8. An exciting new technology is Photo Modulation Intravenous Blood Irradiation which can be easily accomplished thanks to recently developed technology that allows for intravenous delivery of photosensitizing agents to the blood that can have specific antibacterial and antiviral actions as well. Ultraviolet/ozone/ or red laser light irradiation of the venous blood itself can be achieved through a simple IV line. This technology has been proven to be remarkably effective in laboratory tests against multiple different viral and bacterial infectious pathogens.

Proven safe and natural therapies

9. There are dozens of well-known safe and natural TCM herbal nutritional botanical or pharmaceutical agents that have demonstrated strong antiviral actions and/or immune stimulating actions that can be recruited in the treatment of coronavirus.

ozone, liquid iodine, garlic, turmeric, ginger, oregano, zinc, star anise, basil,

rosemary, peppermint, echinacea, apple cider vinegar, green tea, colloidal silver,

astragalus, selenium, vitamins C/D/E, elderberry, liquorice, St John’s wort, and tea tree oil.

Hand Hygiene

Hands are the number one source for spread of bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that are looking to infect you by gaining access to the body via your mucus membranes. So wash your hands often, again and again. Make sure to wash your hands frequently when in public, especially after using the restroom, before handling/consuming food, touching your face, or after touching highly used things such as door handles, crosswalk signal buttons, and elevator buttons, and then again when you return home.

Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soap. Lather your hands with the soap making sure you wash the back of your hands, between your fingers, palms, wrists, and under your nails to remove all dirt, organic matter, and most of the transient organisms that may have been acquired through contact with another person and the environment. Do not give these nasties the chance to penetrate your mucus membranes from your hands.",fake

The coronavirus pandemic has brought the daily work of Congress to a halt.

House and Senate leaders delayed bringing back members until May due to the outbreak, as public health guidelines recommend continued social distancing.

Before the two chambers switched to working remotely, the virus infected several lawmakers and forced many more members to self-quarantine. Some have announced symptoms from their home districts.

Two Republican lawmakers, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, were the first members of Congress to announce self-quarantines, on March 8. Both had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., a few days earlier. An attendant at the conference had fallen ill, its organizers revealed.

The following week, the first two members of Congress announced they had tested positive for the illness. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Utah Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams both said they developed symptoms after a March 14 vote on a coronavirus relief package.

Since the outbreak spread further, dozens more lawmakers have entered self-quarantines as a result of exposure to someone who was sick, including fellow members of Congress, constituents and dignitaries. For example, two Republican senators from Utah, Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, quarantined after their colleague, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, tested positive. Paul was on Capitol Hill and asymptomatic just before receiving his positive test result on March 22.

By the end of March, Congress had entered into an extended recess with lawmakers largely restricted to working from home.

Leaders have said members of Congress must take special precautions to return to Washington, D.C., to vote on any new coronavirus relief measures.

A top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's COVID-19 dashboard was fired on May 5.

The researcher, Rebekah Jones, told a local CBS affiliate that she had refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, Florida Today reported.

Rebekah Jones, a top data researcher in Florida who developed the state's coronavirus dashboard, says she was fired because she refused to meddle with data related to COVID-19 cases in the state.

Jones, who was fired on May 5 from the state's health department, said in an email to WPEC, a local CBS affiliate, on Monday that her removal was ""not voluntary"" and happened because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

In early May, Florida counties began reopening from the state's monthlong lockdown. On Monday, the state entered its first phase of reopening, as gyms, stores, grooming services, and restaurants were allowed to operate at 50% capacity.

White House officials have praised the dashboard's accessibility, according to Florida Today. Researchers and other news outlets have also used the site.

For the past few weeks, though, the site has crashed and been periodically unavailable, Florida Today reported on Monday. Some data has gone missing, and access to underlying data has become a challenge, it added.

In an email to other researchers announcing her departure and seen by Florida Today, Jones said her office was no longer involved in publishing the data, fixing errors, or answering questions.

""As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,"" she wrote in the email. ""After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.""

The Florida Department of Health didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

In a statement to The Miami Herald, though, DeSantis' communications director, Helen Aguirre Ferré, said, that it was a ""repeated course of insubordination"" that lead to her firing.

The office claimed she made unilateral decisions to modify the Department's COVID-19 dashboard without input or approval from the epidemiological team or her supervisors.

""The blatant disrespect for the professionals who were working around the clock to provide the important information for the COVID-19 website was harmful to the team,"" the statement said. ""Accuracy and transparency are always indispensable, especially during an unprecedented public health emergency such as COVID-19. Having someone disruptive cannot be tolerated during this public pandemic, which led the department to determine that it was best to terminate her employment.""

This slide towards a 3rd world war needs to end before it’s too late,"Caitlin Johnston is an independent journalist based in Melbourne, Australia. Her website is here and you can follow her on Twitter @caitoz

Anti-Beijing sentiment is being deliberately whipped up by an imperialist America, its supine allies and supportive media oligarchs. But it’s just self-serving propaganda that needs to be called out.

China is in the news every day now. Today here in Australia, we’re pretending to be offended because a Chinese tabloid published the accusation that our nation is a “giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US,” even though we all know that’s completely true and we should be flattered that at least they said “giant.”

Before that, we were getting indignant over a hefty barley tariff in response to our facilitation of America’s global anti-China spin campaign, which it turns out Washington screwed us on.

Also on rt.com ‘GIANT KANGAROO’ acting as ‘dog of the US’: Chinese newspaper mocks Australia amid trade row

Anti-China sentiment has been thriving in Australia, aided by our Murdoch-dominated news media, State Department-funded think tanks explicitly geared toward manipulating the China narrative, and of course our own deep-seated racism and xenophobia.

Because of its geographical location, the US military/intelligence asset conventionally known as Australia has been a major focal point for the US-centralized empire’s propaganda campaign against the most powerful unabsorbed nation in the world.

China is in the news constantly now, and it’s not because of any virus. It’s not because of Hong Kong, it’s not because of Uighurs, it’s not because of intellectual property violations or any of the other scattershot, unrelated hodgepodge of excuses you’re being fed as to why the Chinese government must be regarded as the latest Actual Hitler all of a sudden.

China is in the news all the time because of imperialism.

To understand what’s going on with China and why the “news” media keep punching you in the face with stories about how awful it is, you really only need to grasp two basic points:

Point 1: We are in the middle of a slow-motion third world war between the US-centralized power alliance and the nations which have resisted being absorbed into it.

A loose alliance of nationless oligarchs who use governments as weapons have secured control over a large empire-like cluster of nations with economic and military might loosely centralized around the United States. In order to gain more power and ensure its ongoing hegemony, this oligarchic empire must keep expanding by absorbing more nations and brutalizing them if they resist. China is by far the most powerful of the unabsorbed nations, followed by Russia at a distant second and Iran at a distant third.

Nuclear weapons make another hot world war undesirable, so this one takes the form of resource control, economic warfare, staging coups, arming oppositional militias to use as proxy armies, expanding military presence in key geostrategic regions under the pretense of fighting terrorism, and “humanitarian interventionism,” with old-school full-scale ground invasions used only as a last resort, and only after manufacturing sufficient international approval to ensure the continued cohesion of the empire-like power alliance.

But the end goal is the same as that of a conventional world war: to beat the other side into submission and compliance. And, in this case, absorption into the imperial blob. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the prevailing orthodoxy in US power structures became that the US must maintain unipolar hegemony at all cost to maintain a “liberal world order” (even if it means abandoning “liberal” values whenever it’s convenient). From that point on, the agenda has been global domination and the slow, suffocating subversion of anyone who gets in the way.

Point 2: Propaganda is used to move this world war along.

In a conventional war, each side has clear military objectives that everyone understands, and the weapons are naturally moved around in accordance with these objectives. In this weird slow-motion world war, nobody understands what’s going on besides the major power players and those who are paying very close attention.

The various agendas against the governments of Iran, Venezuela, Russia, Syria, China, etc. appear different and unrelated when looked at individually, and indeed you will see different political factions supporting some of these agendas but not others. The only thing unifying this slow-motion movement toward the destruction and absorption of all unabsorbed nations is carefully constructed propaganda narratives.

The way these unifying propaganda narratives operate is simple. It would never occur to rank-and-file citizens that a nation on the other side of the planet that’s pretty much just doing its own thing needs to be sanctioned, subverted and brought to heel, so the imperialist oligarchs who own the political/media class make sure everyone is fed custom-made narratives according to their own ideological echo chamber to prevent any domestic inertia from being thrown on these agendas.

Also on rt.com Is the US abandoning its war on Iran to focus directly on the so-called China threat?

Once there’s sufficient agreement that Saddam/Gaddafi/Morales/Assad/Maduro/whomever must go, the campaign to subvert, sabotage and absorb that government can safely be escalated.

If you can understand points one and two, you can understand everything that’s happening with China, and everything that will continue to happen. Propaganda narratives will be rolled out with increasing aggression which have the long-term goal of alienating China from its allies, hurting its economic interests, and preventing its rise to true superpower status and creating a multipolar world.

And the funny thing is, none of this is necessary. Westerners have been deliberately propagandized into believing that China wants to take over the world and will do so unless kept in line by the United States, which has surrounded China with military bases in an act of extreme aggression that the US itself would never tolerate from any unabsorbed government. But if you really grill people on how they know that China wants to take over the world, you’ll find they don’t have any substantial evidence for it.

They’ll tell you that China has an authoritarian government which persecutes ethnic and religious minorities, wrongly claiming that this means they want to take over the world and inflict the same on everyone else. They’ll tell you China has sought to expand control over some directly adjacent territories, wrongly claiming that this means they want to dominate the planet militarily like the US currently does.

They’ll cite evidence which shows China is seeking to become a superpower and create a multipolar world (something China openly admits) and wrongly claim that this is proof that they are seeking to dominate the world with unipolar hegemony.

They won’t be able to produce any actual, hard evidence that China is trying to take over the world and censor your internet and take away your rights, because no such evidence exists. It’s a completely empty belief arising from aggressive narrative manipulation.

“One myth I think really that needs to be dispelled is that somehow China is aiming to replace America and going to run the world, and it’s not,” said Chinese venture capitalist and social scientist Eric Li on the John Pilger documentary The Coming War on China. “First of all, the Chinese are not that stupid. The West, with its Christian roots, are about converting other people into their beliefs. The Chinese are not about that. It’s just that — again, I’m not degrading the Western culture, I’m just pointing out the inherent nature, the DNA of two different cultures — the Chinese two thousand years ago built the Great Wall to keep the barbarians out, not to invade them.”

I’d say this is a reasonable summary. After European nations tried to conquer the planet just a few generations ago in the name of spreading Christianity and “civilization,” we’re projecting our sick vestigial colonialist values on a nation whose culture never drove it to such madness.

Also on rt.com 3 heavyweights in the ring: As US-China hostility escalates, what role will be played by the world’s other great power, Russia?

Violently dominating the entire planet for all eternity on the vague suspicion that another country wants to do the same to you is not sane, and is not an option. Unabsorbed nations should be allowed to remain unabsorbed, absorbed nations should have their sovereignty restored (or in Australia’s case, granted to it for the first time since its existence as a nation), and America should begin acting like a normal country.

The notion of “pre-crime” is the purview of dystopian horror fiction when applied to individual people, and there’s no reason we should find the prospect of attacking and destroying for hypothetical future offenses any less insane on an international scale.

There was never any reason for the coronavirus to be made into an issue of international conflict when it could just as easily be an issue of international collaboration, and indeed collaborating is what we should all be doing, with this virus and with everything else. Let’s end this weird slow-motion world war and move toward sanity.

Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho has stated that he is keen for the campaign to get underway once again after speculation arose that he was in favour of further delays.

Responding to the claims in a press release by Tottenham, Mourinho said.

""I don’t think my position in the meeting has been reflected fairly at all today in media reports. I have not asked for any delay.”

The Portuguese manager then went on to clarify his views on the situation.

""I want to train, and I am desperate for the Premier League to return as soon as it is safe to do so, particularly now we are seeing other leagues preparing to return to action,"" Mourinho added.

The Tottenham manager then detailed how his squad has been preparing for a potential restart to the Premier League season.

""I am extremely proud of the way my players have maintained their fitness – they have shown great professionalism, passion and dedication. We have all been working extremely hard through remote squad training sessions and isolated running now the pitches are available to use again at the training centre,” Mourinho stated.

Professional football in England has been suspended since March due to the threat of the coronavirus, but plans have been drawn up by the country’s football association, which aim to outline how matches can be resumed by June.

A particular sticking point has been the proposal to host matches at neutral venues, which many sides argue, would deprive them of valuable home advantage, and teams in the division have been holding talks in a bid to break the deadlock.

Premier League clubs were set to vote earlier this week on whether the move to use neutral grounds to see out the season should go ahead, but the ballot has been postponed.

If the suggestion is voted down, then only a few options for concluding the campaign remain viable.

These include rendering the season “null and void”, calculating the final positions based on mathematical algorithms, or simply ending the league with the current standings in place.

All of these scenarios could prove problematic to clubs in both the upper and lower echelons of the Premier League.

Liverpool would be denied a historic title win, and the relegated sides would be set up for severe financial losses due to diminished gate receipts, sponsorship deals and television revenue.

The German Bundesliga will become the first major football league to kick off once again this coming weekend, and clubs throughout Europe will be observing how it pans out, as they seek to resume play as soon as possible.",fake

The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 each day has continued to increase as more tests have been administered across the country. Each state has declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency, and many have implemented restrictions on travel, business and public gatherings.

A note on data:

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them. Finally, local governments and other organizations count and update case data differently, meaning different sources of information may show different numbers of cases.

Sometimes, data sources or formats change unexpectedly, leading to temporary inaccuracies in county-level data. We fix these as soon as possible. However, if you see a problem let us know at coronavirusdata@usatoday.com.

One such city is Nashville, Tennessee, where the fairgrounds are being used by the city in an attempt to quash an outbreak among homeless residents. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the city’s coronavirus task force, said everyone who has tested positive can be ordered into quarantine. He added:

“Everyone is entitled to come and go as they want, typically, but in the fairgrounds situation we wanted to make sure that people who are positive stayed in the ill parts of the shelter — period.”1

Jahangir said the vast majority of people who tested positive in Nashville have cooperated with officials, so “formal quarantines” have been unnecessary. However, the city has the option of using a legally enforceable quarantine order whenever necessary, and recently had to do so after a COVID-19 patient jumped a fence and fled the Nashville Fairgrounds.

Health officials informed the man he could not leave until he was cleared, but he jumped a fence and left anyway, according to the arrest affidavit, which was the first of its kind in the city. The man was stopped and arrested by Metro Nashville Parks police by a city cemetery nearly two miles from where he had been quarantined.

The arrest highlights the difference between citizens advised to remain at home and those ordered into quarantine. The mayor of Nashville has instructed residents to stay home as much as possible. However, those who test positive for coronavirus can be ordered into quarantine, which police can enforce.

RELATED STORY:

In addition to Nashville, commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida unanimously approved a plan to shelter the homeless in the old Palm Beach County Detention Center near the South Florida Fairgrounds.

Residents in the area sounded off, expressing frustration at being left out of the conversation. One such resident, Blair English, said:

“We are worried about having up to 125 homeless people right down the road from us.”2

RELATED STORY:

County leaders say the old detention center is a safe place for the homeless to lay their heads. They’ll have access to job training and medical care. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner added:

“When folks come to the county commission and say ‘I don’t want this person in my backyard,’ well they are not going to be in your backyard. But they are in other people’s backyard right now and they are not being well taken care of by the government and that’s not acceptable.”2

Palm Beach County leaders made it very clear that people who opt out of using the shelter won’t be allowed to continue camping at parks, while advocates for the homeless feel for the plan to work, it’s going to come down to how it’s presented to the people who will use it.

Homeless resident David Thorton Jr., like dozens of others living in tents at John Prince Park, says he’s thrilled to hear about the access to resources to help him get back on his feet, but he’s not completely sold on the plan. He said:

“If it looks like a jail… I feel like they are just trying to lock up the homeless because they think that we are lower than scum. I understand that it’s not meant to be [a] luxurious thing, but if it’s like a jail that’s kind of pointless. It’s making us look like we are ex-cons and stuff.”2

In its decision, which is binding, the court said the virus “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan” and questioned why fighting it was “swallowing so much money”.

The court ordered shopping malls to be reopened if health authorities do not object, and curbs to be lifted on businesses opening on the weekends.

The order was issued using the supreme court’s broad authority to issue rulings “suo motu” - on its own motion - without waiting for a particular case to come before it.

Pakistan has reported 42,125 COVID-19 cases and 903 deaths. While those totals are low so far compared to many Western countries, the numbers have risen sharply this month.

Authorities, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, have said the rise in cases has been lower than projected estimates. Faced with the prospect of the lockdown causing economic collapse, they allowed retail markets to reopen last week in a phased lifting of a countrywide lockdown.

Doctors have criticised the reopening, expressing concern that the virus could quickly spread and overwhelm the health system.

“It will definitely lead to an increase in the number of cases, the number of critical cases,” the secretary of Pakistan’s Young Doctors’ Association, Salman Kazmi, told Reuters this month. “We are concerned about pressure that will come on the hospitals.”

Re-opened markets were immediately packed with customers last week, with little sign of social distancing or face masks.

The court said that as long as markets were open, there was no justification to shut shopping malls. It found no “justifiable rational or reasonable” basis for businesses to be ordered to shut over the weekend.

“We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this Coronavirus (COVID-19), for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said.

The court order came as the country’s railway announced that it will resume limited train operations from May 20, and two of the four Pakistani provinces started opening public transport.

USA TODAY NETWORK PRESSROOM

USA TODAY NETWORK today launched a series about America’s food chain to tell the stories of the people who are working to keep America fed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through a series of intimate portraits, Gannett journalists will shine a light on the lives and work of the people who pick the oranges, slaughter the pigs, truck the goods and cook the food, so our nation can continue to eat amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The first story published in the series is about a worker at a large meat processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota – the state’s largest city with a population of 180,000 where Gannett’s Argus Leader newsroom is located. The in-depth piece spotlights John Deranamie, who came to the United States from Liberia during the civil war, has worked at the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls for over eight years and contracted COVID-19 as part of his job.

Over 40 Gannett journalists from more than 10 newsrooms across the country are contributing to this series led by USA TODAY consumer editor Michelle Maltais and Des Moines Register politics editor Rachel Stassen-Berger. New stories in the series will continue to roll out over the coming weeks.

“Food workers have faced great risks to keep America fed, and we wanted to focus a spotlight on some of the people in the food chain,’’ said Jeff Taylor, USA TODAY’s executive editor for news. “The collaboration for this series represents the strength and reach of our national news network.’’",real

The NHS and socialized medicine, despite being cheered during this crisis, continue to be horrible.

And the dependency on immigrant workers, who appear to be more susceptible to the virus, may have worsened the crisis in these hospitals, just as they are believed to have done in Swedish nursing homes, as I discussed in, ""Sweden Cared More About Islamophobia Than Saving Elderly in Nursing Homes From Coronavirus.""

As previously noted, most of the UK health care doctors and medical staff who died of the virus are minorities. What role did they play in spreading the virus in hospitals?

An estimated 44 percent of doctors in Britain are from ethnic minority backgrounds, significantly higher than the 13 percent in the population at large. Last year, more than half the new doctors who registered in Britain were born overseas. But experts say it’s still baffling that 93 percent of the doctors who have died of covid-19 were ethnic minorities.

Again, the British dependency on foreign doctors proved to be disastrous. What role did foreign staff play in the US nursing home outbreaks?

2. The infection rates in some UK hospitals have serious implications for the mass deaths in US nursing homes.

Up to a fifth of patients with Covid-19 in several hospitals contracted the disease over the course of the pandemic while already being treated there for another illness, NHS bosses have told senior doctors and nurses. Some of the infections were passed on by hospital staff who were unaware they had the virus and were displaying no symptoms, while patients with coronavirus were responsible for the others. The figures represent NHS England’s first estimate of the size of the problem of hospital-acquired Covid-19, which Boris Johnson last week said was causing an “epidemic” of deaths. In a national briefing last month on infection control and Covid-19, NHS England told the medical directors and chief nurses of all acute hospitals in England that it had found that 10%-20% of people in hospital with the disease had got it while they were inpatients.

How do those rates apply to US hospitals and nursing homes? That's the big question.

The UK numbers show that there's a major risk of patients in facilities contracting coronavirus. Residents in nursing homes where standards are lower, staff often less well trained, and residents much more vulnerable would potentially have a higher death rate.

Beyond that, there is the big question of policies by Democrat governors, Cuomo, Murphy, Whitmer, and Newsom, among others, to send coronavirus patients to nursing homes. The UK numbers give us a sense of just how badly coronavirus can spread, first in hospitals, and then in other facilities, which gives us a sense of how catastrophic these policies were.

Cuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. “Older people… are going to die from this virus,” he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. “I don't think there's any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.” ""We've tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it's virtually impossible,"" he falsely claimed.

That is clearly untrue.

The UK numbers only deepen the indictment.",fake

SUMMARY: Four months later, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world. How to follow this bizarre presidential campaign. That armed protest in Michigan makes the ""reopen"" movement look thuggish and dumb. Turns out, ""Groundhog Day"" is a horror movie. The most popular stories on Insider this morning...

A few months in, the US coronavirus response is still one of the worst in the world

Back in January, the United States and South Korea each identified their first confirmed coronavirus case on the same day.

South Korea responded immediately and competently, by testing, tracing, and isolating cases and getting ahead of the epidemic.

The United States, meanwhile, initially denied that the virus was a threat, blew its first attempt to roll out tests, and then never marshaled the strong federal response that could have slowed the outbreak before it really got rolling.

Three months later, here's where things stand.

South Korea is close to exterminating the virus:

The US has, finally, after about six weeks of half-hearted lockdowns, ""flattened the curve."" But the US is still confirming about 30,000 cases a day — with the true number of cases likely far higher. The US is behind where it needs to be on testing and tracing capacity and lacks a clear strategy for isolating cases and protecting the most vulnerable.

The tragic result of the US's poor response is the highest number of fatalities in the world. More than 63,000 Americans have died, and counting. As a chart of ""deaths per million"" shows, the US has company in this grim statistic: The UK, Spain, Italy, and other countries were similarly blindsided and slow to react. But a glance at South Korea shows what could have been.

So, what's the outlook from here?

As pressure and frustration about lockdowns build, the US is starting to reopen. The frustration is understandable: The pandemic has clobbered our economy and upended our lives. But without a strong testing-tasting-and-isolation response—or a more sophisticated and optimized set of restrictions—""shelter-in-place"" lockdowns have been our most effective tactic. Most experts think the reopening move is premature and will likely lead to a reacceleration of outbreaks in some areas of the country.

The US has ramped testing capacity, but is still far behind where it needs to be. The US is now doing a little more than 200,000 tests per day, but experts believe it needs to be doing many times more. Experts also estimate that the US will need to hire as many as 300,000 contact tracers to interview everyone who has a confirmed case, figure out who they interacted with, and warn and test them. And, because the coronavirus transmits easily within the home, the US also needs to develop a clear isolation and quarantine approach.

US states and cities can and must execute much of this strategy. But they need federal money, resources, and leadership to do it. Alas, the US still lacks a strong, competent federal response.

Our best hope is that infections slow sharply, testing and tracing capacity continues to increase, and we discover strong drugs and treatments before the fall flu season. Otherwise, we'll be living with this pandemic well into next year and beyond. —HB

How to follow this strange presidential campaign

""This never happened"": On Friday morning Joe Biden denied Tara Reade's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s, capping a chaotic week in the 2020 presidential campaign, during which:

And that was just this week!

The 2020 presidential election takes place six months from Sunday, so we're at the start of what promises to be one of the strangest political seasons in American history. The pandemic has played 52-card pickup with the campaign—the Democratic primaries more-or-less called off, the Democratic nominee campaigning from his basement, the conventions on the brink of cancellation, Election Day itself at risk, the presumed campaign issues—strong economy, impeachment, corruption, immigration—made obsolete by the COVID-19 catastrophe.

This disarray and uncertainty mean that we're going to have to follow this campaign differently than we have in the past. The 2020 race will not have traditional campaign events, so a lot of the natural color of the campaign will vanish. The overwhelming nature of the pandemic and the economic collapse will flummox traditional forecasting tools. Instead, the election will likely boil down to three key questions. These, not all the swirl, are what to pay attention to in coming months.

First, how much blame and credit is Trump getting for the pandemic, the economic collapse, and any potential rebound? How much is he being held responsible for whatever direction the country seems to be going in November?

Second, is Biden a credible candidate, or will he be seriously damaged by either the Reade accusation or something else? Depending on where we are with question one, he doesn't have to be good, just barely viable, to defeat Trump

Third, and most importantly: Instead of looking at polls, look at the mechanics of voting. The variable impact of the pandemic — and how partisan state officials respond to that — could cause vast differences in how the election actually takes place in different states. It may matter less which candidate has strong support in a state than how that state is conducting its election — by mail or in person, in the midst of an outbreak or during a quiet time, with more open polling stations or fewer. — DP

Armed protest in the Michigan statehouse diminishes the reopen movement

A militia group with no political affiliation from Michigan stands in front of the Governors office after protesters occupied the state capitol building during a vote to approve the extension of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's emergency declaration/stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at the state capitol in Lansing, Michigan Seth Herald/Reuters

Yesterday's protest in Michigan represented a new, disturbing development in the reopen movement. The peaceful crowd that swarmed the lobby of the state capitol, protesting the ongoing state of emergency, included at least half-a-dozen heavily armed men.

Michigan law permits open-carry even inside the state capitol (though not on the legislative floor), so the men were breaking no laws. Still, the images of them occupying the public galleries above the lobby were disturbing: Some Michigan legislators wore bulletproof vests as they entered the building.

The armed display distorts a critical public debate. The display in a state capitol — in the place built for peaceful, civil debate — warps the work legislators need to do, and overlays it with menace. You can't argue with a loaded gun.

It's also worth asking whether those praising these armed protesters would have responded the same way had a group of African-American men, similarly armed, done the same thing. —DP

922,709,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/8/21252606/asian-americans-pbs-documentry-prejudice-amid-coronavirus,2020-05-08,‘Asian Americans’ PBS documentary explores prejudice and perseverance amid coronavirus,"A century of racist attacks detailed in the new PBS documentary series “Asian Americans” might have felt like ancient history just a few months ago.

But through the lens of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China and is now hitting the U.S., being painted as a foreign enemy has become all too familiar. Hundreds of Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation’s first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have hurled century-old slurs like “Chinaman.”

Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV’s “Lost” and “Hawaii Five-0,” faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim, who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels “back to 100%.”

“It’s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it’s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even against something as seemingly universal as injustice,” Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.

The five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans’ impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, “Fresh Off the Boat” star Randall Park and a host of people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.

May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians’ contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.

The virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month, Korean American actor John Cho wrote how “belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who ‘brought’ the virus here.”

That anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.

“Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it,” Kim said. “Asian Americans have a unique history in America. It’s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part of our nation’s history.”

Renee Tajima-Peña, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.

“We start at a time where we can still find people, if they’re descendants, with pictures and photographs,” Tajima-Peña said. “On the one hand, there was choosing which stories we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it’s TV. We have to make sure it’s something that’s watchable and the audience can engage with.”

The series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in Detroit.

But it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.

There’s also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

Comedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.

Like Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.

“I had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,” he said at a virtual town hall last week. “The generation after 9/11 ... they’re gonna have to question where we are now. It’s going to inform how they will see the world.”

He’s glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.

“Once it’s on PBS, it feels like an official document,” Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. “This marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn’t there before.”

Tajima-Peña wouldn’t alter the episodes to address the pandemic if she could, saying viewers will inevitably connect it to present-day xenophobia. It’s a “new story that really is an old story.”

“The whole COVID crisis, it’s really just amplified all the fault lines in the United States of race and class, poverty, health care. In terms of Asian Americans, of course, it’s this idea we’re so-called foreigners,” she said.

One of her hopes is the series will inspire younger Asian Americans to think beyond social media rants to activism.

“Our backs are against the walls. How do we move forward together? That’s what you see in the series,” Tajima-Peña said. “Asian Americans had to come together to defend our own rights.”",real

In some respects, her model cannot be copied in the United States. She is a monarch, and we had some disagreements about that matter in 1776. She is a living link to the most harrowing experience in living memory, the Second World War. And, at 92, she has accumulated a lifetime’s reservoir of trust and goodwill.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

But the queen’s address does have lessons for us Yanks, and particularly for Joe Biden. Part of what made the queen’s speech affecting was its theme of unity. She didn’t speak to the people so much as for the people.

She thanked, first of all, the health care workers and other essential employees who “selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all.” Next, she extended her thoughts to those remaining in their homes and caring for loved ones. “Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.”

In a nod to Winston Churchill’s iconic “finest hour” speech, she offered a tribute to the nation’s character:

“I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”

We’ve heard that at stressful times, people want a strong leader, and that this accounts for the rally-around-the-flag effect so evident in opinion polls worldwide. Even Donald Trump has benefited, at least a little, from this reaction. But that isn’t the whole story.

Trying times also bring out people’s altruism and longing for unity. In my own circle, among friends, relatives and the neighborhood Listserv, offers of help, volunteering and contributions have overflowed. Neighbors volunteer to shop for elderly residents.

One person posted that she cannot cut her lawn because she hurt her foot. Another responded immediately, “I would be elated to mow your lawn since that’s what I do for work and I’ve got nothing better to do.”

We’ve focused so much in recent years on the primitive side of our natures — the part that responds to tribalism and hatred of “out” groups. But while those traits are real enough, we didn’t achieve great civilizations by suspicion alone. Cooperation and, in Queen Elizabeth’s phrase, “fellow feeling,” is also part of our nature. Without cooperation, we’d still be wandering the savannah in groups of 15 or 20 with spears in one hand and babies on our backs.

Humans are cooperative creatures — even, at times, selfless ones. In wartime, men throw themselves on grenades to save others. In this time of plague, doctors and nurses willingly put their own lives at risk to save people they don’t even know.

Americans are already behaving in cooperative and unifying ways. What they lack is a voice. President Donald Trump is utterly incapable of sounding those notes. When he attempts it, as, for example, when an aide draws up some uplifting rhetoric, he seems to be sounding out the words as if reading another language. He is far more comfortable searching out enemies — the media, his predecessor, the “deep state,” underappreciative governors, General Motors and so forth.

Joe Biden, by contrast, is well-suited to the unifier role. His strength is a sympathetic understanding of others’ pain. His instincts are toward conciliation and cooperation, to the point that Democratic partisans were sometimes dismayed when, earlier in this cycle, he reminisced fondly about “getting things done” with Republicans.

Just now, in the midst of the crisis, Biden lacks an opportunity to voice a unifying message. But that time will come soon. He should seize it. It comes naturally to him. It would remind us of our better angels, and the country is yearning for it.

A Silver Lining

By Robert Gore

Who will fight for your rights?

…we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force. Ayn Rand, Capitalism, The Unknown Ideal, Appendix, “The Nature of Government,” 1967

We are no longer fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion, we’ve arrived. It is the stage of which every would-be dictator dreams, where his whims are absolute, and everything everyone else says, does, or thinks must comport with those whims, even—impossible though it would be—when they are contradictory.

Science is anti-whim. Nature, as Francis Bacon observed, to be commanded must be obeyed. Nothing illustrates the ultimate inversion of the official coronavirus response better than its leaders’ assault on science in the name of their “science.”

Doctors have been discouraged or prohibited from administering hydroxychloroquine, by itself or in conjunction with other medications, vitamins, and zinc compounds, to treat Covid-19. They have observed and documented the effectiveness of such remedies—mitigation or elimination of the disease’s symptoms—but their observation and documentation are dismissed. Only the validation procedure mandated by the medical bureaucracy—the expensive and complex multistage tests required of new drugs to establish their efficacy and safety—will suffice for official permission. It’s what their “science” demands of a cheap and seemingly effective remedy that’s been on the market for years as a treatment for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria.

So where were the tests and control-group studies for the pandemic models, lockdowns, social distancing, masks, flattening the curve, closing businesses, and contact tracing that have been the official coronavirus responses? Projections are hypotheses, but only one class of hypotheses was officially accepted—disaster scenarios that fed panic and paved the way for further expansion of governments’ power. The doomsday models have been discredited; cases and deaths have been orders of magnitude less than projected.

Countries that haven’t instituted lockdowns have fared no worse than countries that have. Andrew Cuomo, governor of hard-hit New York, recently expressed surprise that two-thirds of hospitalized coronavirus patients had been sheltering in place. As if locking people down—often families under close quarters—in apartment buildings that can’t control cockroaches would somehow protect dwellers against a microscopic, easily spread, fast replicating, and virtually infinite virus.

No science at all supports social distancing; six-feet is an arbitrary construct (i.e., whim) of some medical would-be dictator. Masks force the rebreathing of your own respiratory waste, weakening your immune system for the dubious benefit of that all-powerful totem: public health. The health you’re supposedly protecting is certainly not your own. It’s like eating your own feces or drinking your own urine for a purported public benefit.

Flattening the curve to ensure adequate hospital space for the wave of coronavirus patients that hasn’t happened has flattened the hospitals, leading to empty rooms and wards and layoffs for medical workers. Bankruptcies will follow.

Lost jobs and shuttered businesses are just collateral damage for our would-be emperors, who have waged senseless wars and inflicted grievous collateral damage on other countries for decades. Now the devastation and misery they’ve left in their wake have come home. Americans who’ve never asked themselves how it felt to be a victim of their government’s senseless wars are now victims of their government’s senseless war on a germ. After an unsustainable debt-propelled respite, the Greater Depression has resumed (it started in 2008) and will last for years. Its poverty and devastation will sicken and kill multiples of the people who will ultimately be afflicted by the coronavirus.

All this supposedly guided by “science,” yet its proponents commit the most unscientific offense—they corrupt their own data. By their own admission the tests they use give both false negatives and false positives. By their own admission they’re corrupting the death count. Doctors have been instructed to list Covid-19 as a cause of death if the deceased had any of the symptoms associated with Covid-19, even though those symptoms characterize a number of other diseases that singly or in combination kill people, especially people with compromised immune systems. Hospitals have a financial incentive to perpetuate this fraud. They receive $13,000 from Medicare for each Covid-19 patient and $39,000 for each patient put on a ventilator (Links here and here).

The coronavirus tyranny has nothing to do with science, medicine, or health, and everything to do with establishing that ultimate inversion: the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission. These past few weeks we’ve seen how our rulers attempted to discard the last fig leaf—democracy—covering their creeping, now galloping, totalitarianism and complete lack of legitimacy.

A camarilla within the nation’s intelligence services, the Department of Justice, and members of the previous administration, including Barack Obama, attempted to depose the democratically elected president of the United States. Such coups are the province of two-bit plotters in banana republics that make no pretense of observing or protecting rights, where might alone makes right. The United States has gone full banana—the stage of rule by brute force.

Democracy is tyranny of the majority, a system that inevitably destroys individual rights. For the history-challenged, individual rights were the still revolutionary concept on which the idea—although not always the reality—of the United States was established. The logical consequence of the full protection of individual rights is the freedom to live your life as you see fit, as long as you don’t abridge the rights of others. Society or any other group of people has no rights apart from the rights of the individuals that comprise it. Governments have no rights, only the duty to protect the rights of individuals to live peaceably and freely. Government must be the servant, not the master, of its citizens. (See the Ayn Rand Appendix cited above, “The Nature of Government,” for a more detailed exposition of the proper role of government.)

We’re light years from that ideal. Individuals must receive permission to, among other things, leave their homes, hold a job, assemble with other individuals, attend houses of worship, visit parks and beaches, or patronize businesses. The governor of my state, Michelle Lujan Grisham, just decreed that masks must be worn by everyone outside of their own dwellings (I wrote STOP MLG’S TYRANNY on mine). Breathing fresh air is now at the sufferance of our overlords. Civilly disobedient soul that I am, I have yet to don my mask. Don’t think sheep don’t get angry—I get murderous looks from mask-wearers.

With every decree issued since this repression began, those who advocate for their individual rights or actually exercise them by violating the decree are denounced, shamed, censored, and in some cases arrested. Anyone who disagrees by word or deed is “selfish,” unwilling to sacrifice for the common good.

What do they mean by selfish? Is it selfish to fight for your rights? Is it selfish to want to work and produce? Is it selfish to be more concerned with your own welfare and the welfare of your family and friends than with the welfare of strangers, the public, or the government that supposedly represents that public? Is your desire for freedom selfish?

There are those who will tie themselves in intellectual knots answering those questions in the negative, but nevertheless asserting that individual rights and their exercise—free expression, free inquiry, free production, and free exchange—can all be justified as conferring the greatest public good. They then wonder why they never win arguments with those pushing collectivized notions of the public good. When might makes right, the public good is whatever the collective’s masters say it is—argument over.

Fighting for one’s freedom and all that flows from it is selfish, profoundly so. If you don’t fight for that which is yours—the individual rights that are the essential condition of your existence—who’s going to do it for you? Anthony Fauci? Bill Gates? Nancy Pelosi? President Trump? Joe Biden? George Soros? Jerome Powell? Adam Schiff? Mark Zuckerberg? Eric Schmidt? Santa Claus? The Tooth Fairy? When was the last time you even heard the term “individual rights” in polite, mainstream discourse? When individual rights are mentioned at all, they’re treated as a quaint anachronism.

And what do they mean by sacrifice? They mean that instead of selfishly fighting for your rights and freedom, you are to unselfishly place them on the sacrificial altar known as the public good. You’re selfish for resisting the sacrifice of that which is rightfully yours, but those collecting what is not rightfully theirs are selfless saints. If you voluntarily board that cattle car, you’ll secure your spot in the Unselfish Hall of Fame, along with millions of others who have lost their property, happiness, freedom, and lives without selfish protest or resistance. You might even be designated a Hero of the Public Good, posthumously of course.

If you find the world’s descent into evil unfathomable, it’s time to rethink the premises that the selfless is the good and the selfish is evil. Collectivist butchers, including the ones pushing the coronavirus hoax, always demand fealty to some cause greater than one’s self. Fall for that one and you’ve already lost two important parts of yourself—your self-respect and your ability to reason.

The precautionary principle—that no risks can be assumed if someone or something somewhere might be harmed—is anti-mind and anti-life, absurdly evil on its face. That philosophical abomination now excuses wholesale violation of individual rights and deadly economic devastation based on projections, bureaucratic whim, and political expediency. The precautionary principle would, if consistency applied, bring human progress to a halt, eventually rendering the human race extinct. Nothing is as unsafe as an insistence on absolute safety.

Risk is what makes life worth living—it’s the driver of human knowledge and progress. Imagine the choices that confronted early humans as they made their first choices. If we build a fire, will it warm us and cook our meat…or consume us? If we eat oysters, will they nourish or kill us? Will the canoe we’ve built float or sink? The forward steps of both our individual and humanity’s journeys have always involved unanswered questions, hypotheses, risk, experimentation, trial and error, tragedy, and triumph. It takes no imagination at all to envision potential risks. Make fear and safety paramount and none of those steps could have or will be taken.

To believe that risks can be eliminated by arbitrary edicts is delusional; to enforce those edicts tyrannical; to comply with them suicidal. Wars are always fought and tyrannies always established in the name of somebody’s safety. The betrayal of individual conscience and surrender of individual rights to a collective for safety’s sake never produces safety, only misery, destruction, despair, terror and death. That’s a lesson we’re set to relearn as we proceed through one of those darkest periods of human history.

There is a silver lining in all this: the curtain has been lifted, we now know exactly what we confront. Present governments and their many bootlickers and minions do not recognize—much less protect or hold themselves subordinate to the protection of—individual rights. Nor should we expect that they will do so within our lifetimes. Absent their replacement via revolution or abandonment via secession, we will continue to live in a political order where they are free to do as they please while we may act only by permission.

If we want our rights, our freedom, and our lives, we’re going to have to fight for them with word and deed. It has ever been so; it will ever be so. Those who choose to fight will have one important ally: rule by brute force is the agent of its own collapse. It has always failed, it always will. Whether we have the virtue and wisdom to replace it with it’s antitheses—freedom and individual rights protected rather than destroyed by government—remains to be seen.

Apple’s decision to bring employees back to its offices — including its Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, California — contrasts with some other large tech companies, many of which have extended work from home polices due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Apple is planning to have employees to return in phases over a few months. The first phase focuses on employees who are unable to do their jobs from home or who are “facing challenges working from home,” reports Bloomberg. This will likely include employees who work on the company’s hardware products, and some employees who are part of this phase have apparently already started working at Apple’s offices again. More employees will return to Apple’s offices in a second phase of the plan that’s scheduled to start in July.

Employees are scheduled to return in two phases

It’s unclear what changes Apple may make in its offices to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as improving ventilation. But some employees asked to return may only have to be in the office for certain amounts of time, according to Bloomberg, and CEO Tim Cook reportedly told employees in April that temperature checks and social distancing would likely be implemented when employees return.

Some other major tech companies are not asking employees to return to offices as quickly as Apple is. Both Google and Facebook will allow most employees to work from home through the rest of the year, Amazon will let employees work from home until “at least” October 2nd, and Twitter is letting employees work from home indefinitely as of Tuesday.

Apple also plans to open some of its retail stores after closing all of them outside of China on March 14th. Some stores in Idaho, South Carolina, Alabama, and Alaska will apparently be opened sometime this week, and employees will have to submit to temperature checks and wear masks.",real

(Article by Jon Street republished from CampusReform.org)

For years,Â Campus ReformÂ has reported on the number of Confucius Institutes on U.S. college campuses. Funded by the communist regime, these centers are marketed as Chinese language and culture centers. However, U.S. intelligence officials have warned that these centers are little more than “propaganda” arms of the communist country.

The radical left will stop at nothing to intimidate conservative students on college campuses. You can help expose them.Â Find out more Â»

Even the former Chinese propaganda minister, Â Liu Yushan, wrote in a 2010 article for Chinese-state media, âWith regard to key issues that influence our sovereignty and safety, we should actively carry out international propaganda battles against issuers such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan, human rights and Falun Gong. â¦ We should do well in establishing and operating overseas cultural centers and Confucius Institutes,”Â PoliticoÂ reported in 2018.

While China and the U.S. disagree on most things, this appears to be one area in which officials from both countries share opinions.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a 2018 congressional hearing when asked about Confucius Institutes on college campuses, âThe level of naÃ¯vetÃ© on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues. Theyâre exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere. But theyâre taking advantage of it.â

CIA reports obtained byÂ The Washington Free BeaconÂ further revealed, “The [Chinese Communist Party] provides âstrings-attached’ funding to academic institutions and think tanks to deter research that casts it in a negative light. It has used this tactic to reward pro-China viewpoints and coerce Western academic publications and conferences to self-censor. The CCP often denies visas to academics who criticize the regime, encouraging many China scholars to preemptively self-censor so they can maintain access to the country on which their research depends.”

While legislation signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 resulted in about a dozen U.S. colleges shuttering Confucius Institutes on campus, those closures were largely the result of their loss of funding, rather than concerns for the country’s national security.

And now, nearly two years after that legislation became law, more than 75 Confucius Institutes are still in operation in the U.S., most of them on college campuses. From Maine to Florida to Kansas to California, these centers claim to educate American students about Chinese language and culture, and administrators who run the campuses on which they operate appear to believe the same country that claims to have fewer coronavirus deaths than the U.S, despite its population being more than three times the size of the U.S. population.

Based on data from theÂ National Association of Scholars,Â along with records maintained byÂ Campus Reform, the interactive map below shows the locations where Confucius Institutes still operate. Hover your cursor over each dot to reveal the name of each college or school that currently hosts one of these centers.

One of those that’s managed to stay open is The Jibarito Stop, a popular lunch and dinner spot on 18th Street in Pilsen.

But as COVID-19 ravages meat processing plants across the country, leading to shortages, the Puerto Rican restaurant will close its doors for an indefinite period of time starting Wednesday as prices for some cuts have skyrocketed.

“We usually get around 600 pounds of inside round steak a week for around $3 a pound, but now it’s at $6 a pound,” said Cely Rodriguez, who opened The Jibarito Stop with her business partner Moraima Fuentes in 2015.

“We’ve managed to stay open this long and thankfully so far business has been good, but at this rate, we would start losing money if we didn’t close.”

Meatpacking workers hit hard

The squeeze felt by The Jibarito Stop and other restaurants, experts said, is directly tied to large coronavirus outbreaks at meatpacking plants nationwide.

More than 4,900 workers at the facilities have contracted COVID-19, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Friday. At least 20 have died.

Those infections have added to the disproportionate burden facing black and Latino working-class communities during the pandemic as approximately 70% of meatpacking workers are either black or Latino, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

Immigrants have also been hard hit as they represent 52% of frontline meatpacking workers despite making up 17% of the total U.S. workforce. Nearly half of frontline meatpacking workers live in low-income families, while one in eight have income below the poverty line.

The CDC said meatpacking plants became hotspots for the virus because they have difficulties maintaining physical distance among employees. Another factor cited is that many meatpacking workers live in crowded households and often carpool to work.

Despite the high infection rates, some plants that were forced to close have now reopened at limited capacity in the wake of an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Shortages here to stay

Still, the nation’s meat supply is “down across the board,” said Sarah Little, a spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute, an industry trade group, “so the next couple of weeks we should see how the system works. It’s never been tested like this before.”

Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association, an industry group, said the meat shortage will be a reality for the foreseeable future.

“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” he said, “so restaurateurs should try and buy the meat that they can right now.”

That strategy might work for restaurants that can buy and store meat in bulk, but small joints like The Jibarito Stop are caught between buying whatever meat is available — at whatever price — and potentially charging customers more to make up the difference.

“Right now, steak is our most popular item, and the cut we usually buy is either unavailable or too expensive,” Fuentes said. “And what is available is frozen, and we can’t use that because we don’t have a walk-in cooler. It’s important to have our meat fresh — that’s the only way we can make it work.”

While the meat shortage is the main factor behind The Jibarito Stop’s temporary closure, Fuentes said the pandemic has cut into her bottom line in other ways, too.

“The price for sanitation products like masks and gloves has gone up by a lot [and] third-party delivery vendors like Grubhub and Uber Eats sometimes take up to 30 percent of a sale [or more] and that’s really all we got coming in right now,” she said.

Rodriguez said the restaurant doesn’t have the wherewithal to pay its handful of employees while it’s closed, but she hopes that shutting down for now will help ensure they have a job to come back to.

“Our margins were already so small, and now they’ve basically disappeared,” she said. “It was a tough decision to close, but we want to be here for our employees for when we finally have a chance to fully open up.”

LONDON — Within hours of the British government announcing that its National Health Service could no longer dedicate the resources to test every suspected case of coronavirus, a doctor at a private clinic in London began procuring supplies of screening kits that he has since been selling for three times what they cost.
“I know that a lot of people are slagging me off for racketeering,” said the doctor, Mark Ali, using a British term to refer to the insults he had received. Within a week, he had taken in 2.6 million pounds in orders, about $3 million.
“On the contrary,” he said in defense of his activities. “I met a national need at the point when the government was doing little.”
Widespread testing for the coronavirus has since emerged as a central pillar of the British government’s strategy to combat the outbreak. But private clinics, labs and go-between distributors have jumped at the opportunity to trade in testing services, snapping up supplies of diagnostic kits that the government badly needs.
[Update: Boris Johnson, U.K. Prime Minister, has the coronavirus.]Adding to the concerns, some of the kits have been sold at a steep markup, bringing accusations of profiteering. Many are also unreliable, producing false negatives and false positives. Some are outright fakes.
Britain, like the United States, changed tactics after its leaders came under fierce criticism for initially failing to test widely enough. It now aims to test 25,000 hospital patients a day, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that the government would buy “millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.”
Public health officials have said that they are in discussions with nearly two dozen private firms about coronavirus testing systems and that they had signed a deal worth about $1.2 million with one laboratory to provide the kits.
While there is little doubt that the government will reach its goal, experts say the authorities should not have to compete with private companies for testing kits or for other important items at this crucial moment.
“A scarce, vital resource like testing must be thought of as a public resource, no matter whether it’s produced and provided by the government or the private sector,” said Dr. Jonathan Quick of the Duke Global Health Institute in the United States, who is a former director of medicine policy at the World Health Organization. “Not to do so further endangers everyone,” he added.
That has not stopped some companies from trying to cash in, which is not strictly speaking illegal but can carry a stigma.
Consider AlphaBioLabs, a small private service in northwestern England that was, until now, probably best known for carrying out DNA tests on “The Jeremy Kyle Show,” a tabloid-style daytime TV program in Britain that was canceled last year.
In a statement published on March 20, the lab said it had been “shocked and saddened to receive so many desperate inquiries from front-line organizations, such as the N.H.S., needing the Covid-19 screening test.” The company pledged to sell its “initial stock” to the National Health Service at cost, but did not say how many testing kits that included.
Three days earlier, AlphaBioLabs — which has since stopped marketing the test to the public — had announced that it would be selling its kit for £125. One newspaper hailed the news with the headline: “Brit lab’s new finger-prick test can ‘detect virus in 15 minutes.’”
But the British lab did not create the test. The one advertised on its website was made by an American company, BioMedomics. Each kit costs around $2 to manufacture and no more than $9 to buy wholesale.
David Thomas, managing director of AlphaBioLabs, said that the cost of the test was only one expense in their marketing. The company also pays for a demonstration by a medical worker and online tutorials for businesses with larger orders. He also pointed to rising component costs, and packaging and logistical expenses.
Mr. Thomas declined to answer questions about how much profit the company made per test or how many it had sold, but he said that the profit margin was “very modest and in line with industry norms.”
BioMedomics confirmed that the British lab had placed an order for coronavirus tests — a minimum order is 1,000 kits — but would not provide any further details. “As a small company,” said a spokesman, Kent Lupino, “while we try to vet resellers as best we can, we do not have control over all those who would use this pandemic as an opportunity to blatantly profiteer from those in need.”
AlphaBioLabs said it was hoping to clear its backlog of orders and had enlisted manufacturers with offices in China, Germany and the United States, but refused to name them. Going forward, Mr. Thomas said, the lab would sell the tests only to the N.H.S., emergency services and to businesses classified by the government as “critical infrastructure companies.”
“AlphaBioLabs is absolutely not profiteering from this global health pandemic, but providing a vital service which is in great demand,” he added.
Annelise Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that governments should set a cap on the price and number of tests available through the private sector.
“While I am all for liberal and extensive testing, and am not against the private sector offering testing,” she said, “the government needs to clamp down on any exploitation during a time of crisis.”

Dr. Ali, who runs the Private Harley Street Clinic in London, said he was unrepentant about his trading, after taking orders for nearly 7,000 tests at £375 each. He said he had donated 100 tests to the N.H.S.
“I’m entirely comfortable with the price, and if somebody else wants to offer it for less, that’s fine,” he said in an interview. “I believe the people should be tested, so I’m going to offer it.”
What Dr. Ali is offering for that £375 takes some explanation.The Private Harley Street Clinic does not manufacture the coronavirus test kits, nor does it distribute them or process any test results. Yet it has sold the testing kits for more than three times the £120 that the manufacturer, Randox Laboratories in Northern Ireland, charges the public directly.
Once ordered on the Private Harley Street Clinic website, the tests are shipped from Randox directly to customers without ever passing through the clinic. Dr. Ali declined to say what he paid for the kits and claimed not to know what profit he had made, but he said that his price included clinical advice.
Private Harley Street Clinic’s main asset appears to be the marketing value its name brings through an association with the renowned medical street in London — despite company records showing that the “clinic” is actually based at Dr. Ali’s apartment, miles away in North London.
The firm was incorporated in 2017 shortly after Dr. Ali’s two previous companies, which had almost identical names, were struck off the government’s register of companies for failing to provide required financial data. Private Harley Street Clinic was also threatened with being struck off until it posted financial accounts last summer, which showed that it had total net assets of less than £200.
Dr. Ali said that his clinic had delivered orders for tests worth £1 million so far and that he had been so overwhelmed with requests that he had been forced to hire temporary employees to take calls. The doctor said he planned to hire more staff members this week to help cope with the surge.
“I basically had to create a war cabinet,” he said. “We’re responding to a national emergency.”But despite the extra staffing, and assurances on his website that customers would receive their test returns within three days, the first results were expected to start arriving on Tuesday, more than a week after the service was introduced.
Dr. Ali said that he knew it would be “absolute pandemonium,” but he said that he had been left short after Randox failed to deliver the thousand tests a day that he had been promised andthat his customers had already paid for.
Randox is one of the private labs in discussions with public health officials in Britain about providing tests, but it has already been overwhelmed with demand from the private sector. If the lab did sign a deal with the N.H.S., Dr. Ali said, he would stop selling the kits privately.
Amy Millar, a spokeswoman for Randox, confirmed that the company was “in discussions with various health bodies, including Public Health England, on how to utilize the test to help” in the coronavirus response. The company added that it had developed the test for a “very competitive price” but had “no control” over what retailers charged or what customers were prepared to pay.
Neither of the tests developed by Randox or BioMedomics have been approved by the British or American authorities, though both are accredited labs and have European health and safety certification.
Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for Britain, said last week that the government was in talks with several companies about antibody tests but warned that officials were still not sure that the kits “currently on the market are the right ones.”
The official advice is for people to avoid rapid, at-home coronavirus tests because there was “little evidence to the accuracy of their tests.” Indeed, AlphaBioLabs acknowledged that “screening testing devices are known and accepted by scientists to not be as accurate as laboratory confirmatory testing.”
Professor Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that that was why the government needed to take control of testing, to determine “who sells tests where, at what price and at what standard.”
“Both a false positive and a false negative test will have negative consequences,” she noted.Other kits, however, are just fraudulent.
Last week, the European Anti-Fraud Office began an inquiry into fake coronavirus products, including counterfeit test kits, masks, medical devices and sanitizers, that were being sold around the world for “potentially huge illicit profits.”

Dozens of inmates at the Monroe Correctional Complex in Washington state have staged a brief protest after several fellow prisoners tested positive for the novel coronavirus in recent days.

In a statement issued late Wednesday, the Department of Corrections Washington State said that around 6 p.m. local time more than 100 men at the prison's minimum-security unit ""began engaging in a demonstration in the recreation yard.""

It said fire extinguishers were set off in two housing units at the facility and that verbal directives were obeyed by about half the prisoners, but that the others initially refused to comply.

""All measures to bring individuals into compliance were ignored including verbal directives, pepper (OC) spray and sting balls, which release light, noise, and rubber pellets,"" the statement said.

It said that the situation was brought under control with no injuries and that the facility is now on restricted movement.

""It is believed at this time that the incident was caused by recent positive test results of COVID-19 among six men within the Minimum Security Unit,"" the statement said. ""Those six men were transferred from the Minimum Security Unit on Sunday to the facility's isolation unit.""

It said inmates in the housing unit where the first positive tests for coronavirus were discovered ""continue to have no symptoms of illness or disease (asymptomatic) and are wearing surgical masks for further protection.""

The corrections department announced Sunday that an inmate in the minimum-security unit had tested positive for the virus and on Wednesday that two more, a 68-year-old and a 28-year-old prisoner, also had been diagnosed, according to KOMO News.

KOMO reported that prison staff had been ordered to wear N95 masks and that prisoners in the minimum-security unit were required to undergo body temperature checks.

In a telephone interview earlier this month with Northwest News Network, Arthur Longworth, who has served 35 years at Monroe on a sentence of life without parole for aggravated murder, said prisoners in his medium-security unit have been put on quarantine since a staff member tested positive for coronavirus.

Longworth, who is an award-winning prison writer, said he fears that the disease could spread quickly through the prison because of tight spaces, shared quarters and dense populations.

He said he fears an outbreak of COVID-19 could sweep through the facility in the same way as a fire would.

""I've been in fires in the cell block before, it's a scary thing,"" he said. ""And when the virus gets in here, as it has, it feels kind of like that.""",real

On the economy, “medical metrics” rule for now

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee and face questions about their plans keep the world’s largest economy afloat and missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far.

Two months into the pandemic, many analysts have concluded that U.S. policy has at best fought back worst-case outcomes on both the health and economic front.

Powell has said he sees the likely need for up to six more months of government financial help for firms and families. With regular data on the economy at best volatile and at worst outdated when it comes out, he said “medical metrics” were the most important signs to watch right now.

The presidential pill

Donald Trump surprised many on Monday by revealing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative medicine against the coronavirus - despite warnings about the malaria drug.

“I’ve been taking it for the last week and a half. A pill every day,” he told reporters. “All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK.”

Weeks ago Trump had promoted the drug as a potential treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus, but subsequent studies found it was not helpful. The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about it.

Glimmer of hope

That overshadowed news that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna Inc produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, according to very early data released by the biotech company on Monday.

The vaccine has the green light to start the second stage of human testing. In this Phase II trial to test effectiveness and find the optimal dose, Moderna said it will drop plans to test a 250 mcg dose and test a 50 mcg dose instead.

Reducing the dose required to produce immunity could help spare the amount of vaccine required in each shot, meaning the company could produce more of the vaccine.

Eating with your mask on

Israeli inventors have developed a mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat without taking it off, which they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.

A squeeze of a lever opens a slot in the front of the mask so food can pass through.

959,1520,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/clean_energy_via_legislative_diktat_.html,2020-05-20,Clean Energy Via Legislative Diktat,"For those enamored by the clean electric-car, smoke-and-mirrors ""emission elsewhere scheme"" comes the recently enacted ""Virginia Clean Economy Act"", which includes one of the largest energy storage targets in the country at 2.4 GW by 2035, and prompts state regulators to craft a carbon dioxide cap and trade program that meets the objectives of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

The act, which requires Virginia’s electric utilities and competitive suppliers to generate electricity from 100% renewable energy by 2050, passed on the same day that Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility, announced its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Carbon dioxide has been deemed a pollutant via legislative diktat. Accordingly, embedded in this legislation is language which prevents the Virginia State Corporation Commission from approving “any investor-owned utility to own, operate, or construct any electric generating unit that emits carbon as a byproduct of combusting fuel to generate electricity” until the state legislature has had a chance to review a report from the Air Pollution Control Board. Also embedded are escape clauses allowing fossil-fuel energy just in case the 100 per cent carbon-free dream mandate fails in the real world. In keeping with current virtuous political correctness and emotional zeitgeist, the bill also requires utilities and the commission to consider the social cost of carbon when reviewing the need for a new generation facility.

However, Dominion Virginia Power now says it may need to import energy from pollution-intensive sources out of state, even though nuclear power is part of the permitted energy mix. The price tag for this legislated decree wrought via politically virtuous green posturing, environmental sloganeering, and pandering to climate activists now comes to light. Get ready for acres of environmentally destructive solar panel installations which will fail to meet energy demand in the midst of winter, while decimating native habitat and leaching toxic chemicals into the soil. Look to the new Warren Buffet solar project in Arizona as the template for yet another taxpayer billion dollar boondoggle promising pollution free energy (when the sun shines), and reliance on giga-battery installations when it does not.

Trust that the air-conditioner comes on during a summer lull in ocean breezes when those European-built, experimental offshore wind turbines produce little electricity. Trust that the Atlantic hurricane season does not cause them to shut down in a self-preservation safety mode just when you need electric power. Trust that servicing those giga-windmills in a most hostile saltwater corrosive environment does not take them off-line too often. Trust that those envisioned giga-battery storage complexes for when the sun doesn’t shine, and the wind doesn’t not blow can actually be built. Trust that the tons of rare earth minerals needed to build such batteries can be sourced, and that such battery installations do not become ticking fire and explosion environmental disaster bombs. In England that risk to a small town has been compared to a small nuclear bomb. Safe disposal of the toxic-laden, worn-out solar panels is largely ignored.

Whatever these outcomes, Dominion can pass on these costs to their captive consumers. The State Corporation Commission has estimated ratepayers could see “at least a $23 per month” increase on their bills by 2027-2030… stress on the “at least.”

Virginia seems to be vying with California for the title of creator of the most destructive and unreliable energy policy at the highest cost to its citizens and industry by embracing radical environmentalism and rejecting objective science. However, the realities of a coronavirus economy have finally put the brakes on California’s green dreams. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed budget cuts include canceling billions of dollars in climate change spending. Meanwhile, Virginia’s green plans appear unchanged.

“Out of sight, out of mind,” pollution is now the law of the land, and “just-like-that” (thank you Forrest Gump) by legislative fiat, we Virginians are all carbon free at the expense of pollution elsewhere. Never mind that there will be no measurable effect on the climate. As is usual, there is no definition of how the climate change will be measured; it usually falls back to changes in atmospheric temperature. Even the details of how, where, and when such temperature measurements will be made is open-ended.

With the recent film “Planet of the Humans,” liberal filmmaker Michael Moore upset the green lobby with such comments as: “most energy consumers don't realize the complex ways that so-called renewable energy has been developed with a co-dependency on non-renewables,” and ""The only reason we had been force fed the story 'climate change plus renewables equals we're saved' is because billionaires, bankers and corporations profit from it."" Warren Buffet said it about wind power in 2014: ""For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit."" His aforementioned Arizona solar project would seem to fall into that category, as does Virginia’s new legislation with handouts galore.

Lost in this green crusade is the fact that carbon dioxide is an essential trace gas upon which plants depend for life. Each one of us exhales carbon dioxide at an approximate four percent concentration with each breath, as we are carbon-based life forms. Do not embarrass these legislators by asking how much the climate will be saved by this “Clean Economy Act”, however it might be measured against an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 400ppm.

Get ready for needlessly increased energy costs for local governments and the public in this era of the coronavirus. Natural gas and petroleum are at record low prices, yet Virginia’s new energy plan has promised increased energy costs. For local governments, no problem -- just increase property taxes and property assessments. Those out of work are just out of luck.

By the target date of 2045, the authors of this legislation (including the Virginia governor and legislators who foisted this on the public) will probably (hopefully?) be out of office and forgotten and have no fear of facing recriminations. Not so lucky will be the children and grandchildren of the future facing an uncertain, but expensive, Virginia energy environment.",fake

By June 1, Redfield said, more than 100,000 Americans will likely have died from the coronavirus.

On May 4, President Donald Trump said 100,000 Americans, total, would likely die from the virus.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

By the time June 1 comes around, more than 100,000 Americans will likely have died from COVID-19, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A dozen different models are all forecasting an increasing rate of death in the coming weeks, even as some states have already begun reopening their economies.

In a May 4 town hall, US President Donald Trump told Fox News viewers that, total, ""we're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people."" At that point, there were 68,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19; as of May 14, there were more than 80,000.

On Friday, CDC Director Robert Redfield stated that the number will likely exceed the president's latest worst-case scenario (itself a revision up from the ""maybe 65,000"" Trump predicted in April) by the end of this month.

—Dr. Robert R. Redfield (@CDCDirector) May 15, 2020

Based on the analysis of 12 individual forecasts, the CDC now predicts ""the number of cumulative reported deaths are likely to exceed 100,000 by June 1st."" And the data suggests that, even as some states have begun easing lock downs, the worst is yet to come, with all the models indicating ""an increase in deaths in the coming weeks.""

As Business Insider reported earlier this month, four states that have already begun opening up are conducting far too little testing to safely do so, according to researchers at Harvard University. Those researchers said the US needed to increase testing 400%, at a minimum, to have any hope of opening up safely — and not exacerbating the spread of the coronavirus.

But a practical consequence of such denial-mentality is America will lose the “war” against COVID-19.

On the occasion marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazi Third Reich, the Trump White House made no mention of the Soviet Union’s indisputable military achievement of vanquishing the German fascist regime, instead implying that the US and Britain were the sole victors.

Trump added for vainglorious good measure: “The American spirit will always win. In the end, that’s what happens.”

This outrageous falsification of history takes American absurdity to a whole new exceptional level. There has always been a cloying tendency in US popular culture to overstate the role played by America in defeating Nazi Germany. Hollywood films like ‘Saving Private Ryan’ are unbearable to watch for their vanity and self-regarding Americanism.

But for Trump and his White House to openly claim it was Britain and America that won World War Two without even mentioning the colossal sacrifice of the Soviet Union, really takes the distortion and denial of reality into unchartered territory.

For three years, 1941-44, the Soviet Red Army fought the Nazi Wehrmacht single-handedly. The British and American opening of the Western front with their Normandy landings in June 1944 came as the Nazi regime was crumbling from sustained Soviet counter-offensive and epic battles. Six million Nazi troops were killed in the Eastern Front, compared with one million on the Western Front. The Red Army defeated the elite SS divisions paving the way for the Soviet routing of Hitler’s bunker – the Third Reich’s last stand – in Berlin.

As many as 27 million Soviet citizens died in the heroic war against Nazi Germany, including up to eight million Red Army soldiers. By contrast, the Americans and British each lost less than half a million troops.

Trump’s contemptible ignorance is matched by his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who also used the 75th anniversary to distort the liberation of Europe by the Red Army from Nazi Germany as supposedly leading to a tyrannical occupation by Soviet communism in the postwar decades.

This kind of delusional thinking is not just risible and repugnant. It has practical consequences which can be ruinous. For if the Trump administration can be so disconnected from reality, then its policy choices on other matters will be likewise absurd and dangerous.

Take the administration’s policy of blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump and his officials are accusing China for “covering up” and even inflicting the virus on the US. This “logic” is based on fantastic, unscientific myths, which is creating a dangerous slippery-slope towards confrontation.

By pushing China for financial reparations over Covid-19 deaths and economic damage in the US, Trump is in denial over his administration’s abject failings to contend with the epidemic. But so desperate is Trump’s denial of reality, he is talking up an anti-China rationale that inevitably could lead to war.

The same goes for America’s chances of successful recovery from the pandemic. Trump is goading his nation to reopen the economy pretending that it is safe to do so without adequate testing and protections. Of course, this president views complex public health issues through the grubby lens of making financial profit.

While he is urging his country to reopen – in the pretense that the “American spirit will always win” – Trump is ignoring the reality that his own White House has become a hotspot for Covid-19 infection. Three of the administration’s top health experts are in quarantine due to infection fears. Vice President Mike Pence is reportedly self-isolating after his press secretary tested positive for the disease. A valet to Trump has also been infected.

Kevin Hassett, an economic advisor to Trump, told US media at the weekend that the White House West Wing has become a “scary place to work” – such is the increasing risk of administration staffers succumbing to COVID-19.

Trump has previously likened the fight against the disease to a war. He incessantly congratulates himself for handling the epidemic which last week he compared to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

This president is a walking contradiction from his own delusions and absurdities. He may be right about the “Russiagate"" nonsense and a lot of the “fake news” US corporate news media. We can give him credit on that score. But if Trump can’t even acknowledge the fundamental facts about World War Two and in particular the decisive role played by the Soviet Union, then we should know that his administration is doomed to further failure, specifically in relations with China and in mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic.

Developer Valve announced on Thursday that the 2020 edition of the Dota 2 tournament, known as The International, that was set to take place at the Ericsson Globe arena in Stockholm this August will no longer happen this summer and may be pushed back until 2021. In fact, Valve says it simply doesn’t know when it can announce concrete dates going forward.

“We have been exploring various date possibilities, but it is likely that the event will need to happen in 2021. Given the highly volatile landscape for local gathering restrictions, virus trajectory, and global travel policies, we don’t expect to have enough confidence to communicate firm dates in the near future,” reads the company’s announcement posted to the Dota 2 blog. “In the meantime, we are working on restructuring the DPC season for the fall, and will be providing more information as soon as we have it.”

“We don’t expect to have enough confidence to communicate firm dates in the near future.”

The International, which has run annually since 2011, is not only one of the most popular competitive gaming events globally, but also the most lucrative. Last year’s edition, which took place in Shanghai, boasted a prize pool of more than $30 million, topping the record-breaking pool from the first annual Fortnite World Cup.

Valve says it still intends to draw its prize pool from sales of its Dota 2 seasonal battle pass, but that it will be releasing the battle pass “soon” instead of closer to the event itself, given the circumstances. “However, with our team working from home and things taking longer to complete, the release date of the Battle Pass will be at least a couple of weeks later than usual,” the company says.

Valve’s tournament is just the latest in a long line of esports events forced to shift operations. The Overwatch League, with kicked off earlier this year with big ambitions to host home and away games all over the globe, moved to an online-only format alongside the Call of Duty League, while a major League of Legends league shifted games to an online format, too. Everyone from broadcasters to fans have been impacted in some way. Earlier today, Epic Games announced that it would no longer host a 2020 Fortnite World Cup as it shifts all of its competitive circuit for the battle royale shooter to an online-only structure.

982,1478,https://www.detroitnews.com/picture-gallery/news/local/detroit-city/2020/05/19/first-public-mass-since-covid-19-lockdown/5222421002/,2020-05-19,First public mass since COVID-19 lockdown,"Orlando, Fla. – In ordinary times, the beaches and roads along Florida’s Space Coast would be packed with hundreds of thousands of spectators, eager to witness the first astronaut launch from Florida in nine years.

In the age of coronavirus, local officials and NASA are split on whether that’s a good idea.

NASA and SpaceX are urging spectators to stay at home next Wednesday for safety reasons. Officials in Brevard County, home to the Kennedy Space Center, are rolling out the welcome mat in an effort to jump-start a tourism industry hit hard this spring by coronavirus-related lockdowns.

In this Friday, July 8, 2011 file photo, crowds gather in the surf and on the beach in Cocoa Beach, Fla., to watch the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis on STS-135. It was the final U.S. shuttle mission before the fleet was retired. (Photo: Dave Martin, AP)

If people are comfortable coming and watching the launch, “by all means, come. If they aren’t, I respect that too,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

“I’m not going to tell Americans they can’t watch a great piece of history. I’m just not going to do it,” he said.

The sheriff said he is asking visitors to practice social distancing as they watch the launch of astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a test flight of SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT.

Around 85 reserve deputies will be on hand to monitor crowds and ask people to comply with social distancing if they are in groups. A local chain of beach shops is distributing 20,000 masks to spectators in coordination with the sheriff’s office, Ivey said.

The sheriff, who grew up in Florida watching launches, wants a new generation to be able to experience the energy, excitement and feelings of patriotism that comes from watching a U.S. launch with astronauts.

“NASA is a true part of our history in Brevard County,” Ivey said.

Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine asked potential spectators to watch the launch online or on TV from home. The space agency is also offering a “virtual launch experience.”

NASA is doing its best to facilitate social distancing inside the Kennedy Space Center by limiting access, although it may be hosting two VIPS. Vice President Mike Pence says he plans to be there, and President Donald Trump said he’s thinking of attending.

The visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for viewing launches, is closed to the public.

NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. It will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit for the space agency.

“The challenge that we’re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,” Bridenstine said. “And so we’re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.”.

Although crowd sizes varied, a high-profile space shuttle launch could attract a half million visitors to the Space Coast. Local tourism officials think next week’s launch will bring in no more than 200,000 spectators.

With airline passenger traffic drastically down and nearby Orlando theme parks closed because of the pandemic, “we’re not going to be getting the out-of-state traffic we may have gotten during the shuttle era,” said Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.

“The environment is different with COVID and people now reemerging from stay-at-home orders,” Cranis said. “There are going to be a number of people who are hesitant.”

The Space Coast’s tourism business is down by about 40% for the year, and that could cost the area $1 billion, he said.

“A launch like this after a big long weekend could really give us a shot in the arm,” Cranis said.

Local hoteliers are looking forward to the influx of visitors after two bad months. Tom Williamson, who is general manager of two hotels on the Space Coast, each with 150 rooms or more, said one hotel was closed and the other only had 15% occupancy in April. He expects both hotels to be at or near capacity on the night of the launch.

“We’re glad to seem some signs of life,” Williamson said.

Steven Giraldo works as a technical consultant for a software company in St. Petersburg, Florida, but he has a side gig with some space-buff friends offering charter boat tours for watching launches. For next week’s SpaceX launch, he had booked around 150 people from as far away as Australia for $75 a head on a fleet of boats. He ended up scrapping those plans.

“It would take too much logistical effort to see if everyone is wearing a mask, making sure no one has a fever, and how to you social distance on a boat?” Giraldo said.

Instead, he plans to watch the launch with seven other friends, some from Arizona and Indiana, in a boat on the Banana River.

“This was going to be our biggest event. The historical significance of it created a lot of buzz,” Giraldo said. “But I just don’t know how we could have done it.”

The Elmhurst resident, a middle school science teacher, was a Trump delegate from Illinois.

Almost four years later, with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing an unprecedented health crisis and economic meltdown to the U.S., Fratella told me he won’t be voting for Trump in 2020.

What can persuade a change of mind for a Trump supporter? For the science teacher, it was Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

“I’ve never voted Democrat for president. I don’t know if I would vote for [Joe] Biden or I would just sit it out. But I just can’t square that it’s worth it to vote for him [Trump],” Fratella said.

In 2016, Trump made sense to Fratella, an anybody-but-Hillary man. That Trump was not a “traditional Republican” was fine with Fratella, even though his roots were more with the regulars, not the Trump rebels. Fratella’s first deep dive into politics was volunteering for Bob Dole’s 1996 GOP presidential campaign, when Dole ran against Bill Clinton.

Fratella, 42, liked Trump’s “plain straightforward talk” at the time. “I think to me the alternative was having another Clinton in the White House, and moving further and further to the left, which I thought would happen if Hillary won. So I think that was the main attraction,” he said.

When schools closed and stay-at-home orders were imposed in March, Fratella started watching Trump’s daily Coronavirus Task Force briefings, which quickly became a Trump produced TV show starring Trump.

Fratella, in part, wanted to see what Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, were saying.

“The other part of me was interested just to see what [Trump] would do and what kind of ridiculous statements he would make, you know, or who he would get into it with in the press corps or what kind of silliness he would get involved in,” Fratella said.

I asked Fratella when he realized Trump was going too far.

“I think it was kind of a slow build that each day there was something new where he was saying something incredible, or contradicting his experts.

“I remember him saying in the fall it will be gone. And then Dr. Fauci comes out and says ‘This isn’t going away’ five minutes later,” he said.

“…I don’t know if there’s one point specifically or if it was just kind of a snowball, snowballing effect. But it is frustrating as, you know, to see him just, you know say things that are scientifically untrue.”

A blatant example was Trump’s promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 cure.

“It was mind blowing that he would suggest a drug that he knew nothing about or that he had just heard secondhand that well, maybe this works and then the other day with the sunlight, the disinfectant, those kinds of things blew my mind, …..He’s telling people to inject or to put UV light in your body,” Fratella said.

What is it Trump’s base hears when he predicts the COVID-19 outbreak threat will soon diminish? I asked Fratella to translate.

“They hear the president, the leader of the country say, ‘It’ll be gone’ and they think that he may know something that they don’t,” he said.

You hear Trump talk a lot about his “base.” There is an important difference between the “base” and Trump backers, or in Fratella’s case, ex-supporters. He explains it for me.

“I think the difference between the base and a supporter is that the base will support him no matter what. Come hell or high water....Supporters are a little more analytical and their opinions are less fixed than the base,” Fratella said.

Many in the base, are not as willing, Fratella said, to “see the other side of an argument.”

“I don’t think I was ever part of his base. I was always a supporter, but I could see faults. The fault with the handling of coronavirus was just too much to reason through. It was more than just a policy. It was something that had immediate real-life consequences,” he said.

“I think some of those real-life consequences are being seen in the protests. People being defiant because they read him saying they need to ‘liberate’ their states.”

The body does not store zinc so it is important to meet the daily requirements: men 11 mg a day, women 8 mg but 11 while pregnant and 12 while breastfeeding.

In vitro cellular testing found that zinc was helpful in preventing a variety of RNA viruses which included poliovirus and influenza; somehow it interfered with the way the viruses process polyproteins which prevented them from doing damage.

Other research published in the British Medical Journal identified zinc as a possible treatment against SARS, which is also a type of coronavirus. Zinc ions were found to provide protection against this virus by preventing their attachment to cell surfaces.

“Over the past 30 years, researchers have demonstrated the critical role of zinc in diverse physiological processes, such as growth and development, maintenance and priming of the immune system, and tissue repair,” this authors explain.

“Direct antiviral effects of zinc ions have been demonstrated against rhinoviruses responsible for the common cold (1,2,3,4,5) … (and) [z]inc has also been shown to directly decrease the incidence of respiratory infections in young children from developing countries probably by mechanisms that involve restoration of T-cell immunity lost as a result of deficiency of this mineral.”

Incorporating zinc into your diet can be done through supplements, but the more natural approach is through diet as there are plenty of foods that contain high amounts of zinc.

Oysters contain about 16.6 milligrams of zinc per 100 grams

Hemp seed contain about 9.9 mg per 100 grams

Sesame seeds contain about 7.8 mg per 100 grams

Pumpkin seeds contain about 7.64 mg per 100 g

Cacao powder contains about 6-7 mg per 100 g

Grass fed beef contains about 5 mg of zinc per 100 grams

Alaskan crab contains 7.6 mg per 100 g

100 grams of legumes contain about 12% of the daily recommended value

Cashews contain about 15% of the DRV per one ounce serving

Cheddar cheese contains about 28% of the DRV per 100 grams

One cup of full fat milk contains about 9% of the DRV

Shrimp and mussels contain about 14% of teh DRV per 100 grams

One large egg contains about 5% of the DRV

One large regular or sweet potato contains 9% of the DRV for zinc

Green beans contain about 3% of the DRV per 100 grams

Dark chocolate contains about 3.3 mg or 30% of the DRV of zinc per 100 grams

If you are worried that you are not getting enough zinc speak to your physician or certified medical professional. Zinc is an essential mineral, eating enough is important to maintaining good health and the best way to do that is to ensure that you are eating a healthy diet with a variety of good choices such as seeds, nuts, and legumes.",fake

Rebekah Jones, the architect behind the Sunshine State’s interactive COVID-19 dashboard once praised by the White House, told several news outlets on Tuesday she was removed from her position as Graphic Information Systems manager on May 5 due to “reasons beyond my division’s control.” On Monday, the state’s Department of Health offered her a settlement with the option to resign instead of being fired, which would go into effect on May 26, she said.

Jones, 30, told CBS12 News that her involuntary removal came one day after she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The scientist, however, did not elaborate on which data in particular she refused to alter.

States Are Starting to Reopen Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic. Here Are Their Plans.

To date, nearly 2,000 Floridians have died and 46,442 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Despite the ongoing public health issue, Gov. Ron Desantis announced last week his plan to open up Florida’s virus-stricken economy.

The news of Jones’ ouster was first revealed in a May 5 farewell email she sent to researchers and members of the public who signed up to receive updates on the data portal. In the email, Jones said her department was no longer responsible for updating information on the site “in any shape or form.”

“As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” Jones wrote. “They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.”

The COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard provides daily updates on the numbers of deaths, new cases, and tests for every county in the state. Seen as one of the leading trackers in the state, the portal is heavily relied upon by officials, academics, and residents as Florida moves toward restarting the economy three months after issuing a stay-at-home order.

According to internal emails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, reporters contacted the department on May 4 about a field of data that showed when residents first began to report their virus symptoms or testing positive. The data, according to the emails, showed that Floridians were experiencing symptoms as early as Jan. 1—three months earlier than when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state.

That field of data vanished from the portal several hours later, the Times reported. Then, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry messaged Jones asking her to “disable the ability to export data” from the interactive COVID-19 site.

“Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately,” Curry wrote, referring to Dr. Carina Blackmore, the director of the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection in Florida. “We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published.”

Minutes later, Jones responded saying “this is the wrong call” before complying with the request. About an hour later, at 6 p.m. on May 5, the I.T. director emailed both Jones and Blackmore asking them to “re-enable” the ability to export data “for now.”

The Florida Department of Health did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.

“Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous. These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal,” Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a Tuesday statement to The Daily Beast. “An independent investigation into these allegations is needed immediately. Meanwhile, city and state officials across Florida should closely monitor the situation to protect the public’s health.”",real

A leading epidemiologist explains the right way to use them.","Dr. Tista Ghosh is the senior director of impact evaluation and regional medical director for Grand Rounds.

Even in an ideal recovery scenario, she says, we'll need to practice careful social distancing, use personal protective equipment, and reduce the number of people in a given workspace.

The main coronavirus tests available are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing; each of them have their issues that managers should be aware of if they choose to use them.

PCR leads to a lot of false negatives, meaning you should test employees often. Antibody tests can test for immunity, but not the strength or length of it.

Click here for more BI Prime stories.

As many businesses face reopening, they are pondering ways to keep their workplaces safe. For many, the question of testing is top of mind. Should they offer testing? If yes, given all the concerns on test reliability, what kind of testing should they offer? Furthermore, who should be tested and how often?

In an ideal world, we would have rapid, highly reliable, relatively inexpensive tests available that would let us know who was currently infected. We would also, in theory, have accurate antibody testing, to tell us who was recently infected and potentially immune. Based on these types of tests, only those without current infection and/or evidence of previous infection or immunity would be allowed to return to work. This would decrease the likelihood of viral transmission in the workplace.

But even in that ideal scenario, we would still need to practice enhanced infection control by continuing to maintain at least six feet apart between workers, reducing the number of staff working at any given time, using masks or other protective equipment where close contact is impossible to avoid, and more.

Symptomatic employees should be immediately excluded from entering the workplace, as should close contacts. And re-testing should occur periodically, at least for some initial length of time, to ensure that infection control measures are working.

Unfortunately, we are far from this ideal scenario. The main tests that are available as of the writing of this article are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing, both of which either have challenges with sensitivity (the ability to detect true positives) or specificity (the ability to detect true negatives).

Here are what the two tests are, the problems with each, and how employers should use them.

1. PCR tests and the danger of high false negative rates

COVID-19 PCR tests directly test for the presence of the COVID-19 virus. This test is usually obtained by a nasal or throat swab, and just recently the FDA approved saliva testing. PCR testing indicates whether a patient is infected at the time of testing.

In theory, PCR testing of employees could help employers know who was currently infected. Infected employees would then isolate at home, according to the latest CDC guidelines, and those who were not infected could return to the workplace. In essence, the worksite would reopen virus-free.

Sounds straightforward, right? Unfortunately, the nasal or throat swab PCR test can have a false negative rate of up to 30%. That means for every 100 employees who are infected with the virus, 30 would be missed and could then spread the virus to others when let back into the worksite.

Here's what employers should do if they choose to use PCR testing:

Protect your high-risk employees. Knowing that you might miss up to 30% of people who are carrying the virus, it is especially important to keep high-risk people working from home, along with people who live with or care for high-risk individuals. Start by bringing back only low-risk employees who test negative for the virus. Another option might be to require two negative tests which are 24-plus hours apart, to reduce the chance of a false negative.

Knowing that you might miss up to 30% of people who are carrying the virus, it is especially important to keep high-risk people working from home, along with people who live with or care for high-risk individuals. Start by bringing back only low-risk employees who test negative for the virus. Another option might be to require two negative tests which are 24-plus hours apart, to reduce the chance of a false negative. Re-test every 14 to 28 days. Testing cannot be one and done. PCR testing only tells you if you are infected at one point in time. So, if you get infected a few days after you took the test, you may falsely assume you are still free and clear. And we are learning more and more that people can be asymptomatic with COVID-19, and still spread the virus. Therefore, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, every one to two incubation periods (14 to 28 days), to ensure that they are still negative.

Therefore, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, every one to two incubation periods (14 to 28 days), to ensure that they are still negative. Budget accordingly. Cost may certainly become an issue as a result of re-testing. Some employers may consider testing a random sample of employees to reduce costs.

2. Antibody testing cannot determine who is immune or not with certainty — yet

Antibody (serology) tests measure the presence of virus-fighting antibodies that indicate immunity. These tests require a blood sample, either through a blood draw or in some cases a finger prick. Unlike PCR tests, which detect the presence of the virus itself, serology tests show whether an individual has ever had the virus. In theory, the presence of these antibodies indicates a person has a low likelihood of being infected again.

However, we do not yet know the degree of immunity that people could have from these tests. Initial animal studies do suggest that protective antibodies are produced, but there isn't much human data yet. There have been some reports that antibodies from the plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19 can help severely ill COVID-19 patients. This suggests that human antibodies, at least initially, do effectively fight the novel coronavirus, but more rigorous studies are needed.

In addition, we need to learn how long COVID-19-protective antibodies last. Antibodies to seasonal, common-cold coronavirus have been found to decline steadily within a year of being infected, so some people can be re-infected a year later. But with the coronavirus that caused SARS in the early 2000's, immunity was found to last for up to three years. We don't yet know what pattern will emerge with this novel coronavirus.

Another issue is with the testing itself. There are accuracy concerns with some of the antibody tests currently on the market. One major worry is a potentially high rate of false positives, depending on the manufacturer. A false positive result might wrongly give someone the impression that they have already had the virus and are producing antibodies to it (at least in the short term).

Here's what employers should do if they choose to offer antibody testing:

Vet the test carefully . Ask testing companies specifically for their false positive rates and for information on any independent evaluations that have been conducted on their tests.

. Ask testing companies specifically for their false positive rates and for information on any independent evaluations that have been conducted on their tests. Protect your high-risk employees. Knowing that you might have some falsely positive employees, keep people at high-risk for severe COVID-19 related illness working from home, along with those who share a home with high-risk individuals. Or consider doing PCR testing too, to see if anyone might have an active infection despite having a positive antibody test.

Knowing that you might have some falsely positive employees, keep people at high-risk for severe COVID-19 related illness working from home, along with those who share a home with high-risk individuals. Or consider doing PCR testing too, to see if anyone might have an active infection despite having a positive antibody test. Re-test every two to four months. Even if the antibody test you choose is relatively accurate, we still don't know how long these antibodies last. So, the best thing to do is retest those employees who are coming to the office, to ensure that they are still producing antibodies. Again, costs are a consideration, which can be addressed by testing a random sample of the employee population.

Newer tests have recently come online, such as rapid antigen tests — which detect fragments of viral proteins — and CRISPR tests — which latch onto RNA sequences from the virus. There is limited information available on how accurate these tests are and when they will be widely available. But as we have learned from the past few months, the situation is rapidly evolving. Employers should continue to monitor updates in this arena, in the event that these offer more viable testing options.

Regardless of whatever combination of testing — or no testing — an employer chooses, it is important that they provide as safe an environment as they can for employees. Follow enhanced infection control practices as previously mentioned: maintain the six feet physical distancing, monitor employee symptoms, conduct regular temperature checks, etc. Planning ahead and being prepared to re-close if the number of symptomatic employees increases will be crucial. And continue following the CDC guidelines, as well as those from local and state health officials.

Discrimination based on efforts to contain the coronavirus in China have sparked an outcry in Africa and other places around the world, as the U.S. grapples with its own spike in discrimination against Asians over fears of the disease.

Photos and videos out of Guangzhou show police detaining Africans over concern they could be spreading the coronavirus, CBS News' Ramy Inocencio reports. Images of Africans sleeping on the street after being evicted from their homes have also incited backlash.

Chinese officials maintain that racism does not exist in the country.

""This is denial... of course there is racism,"" said professor Adams Bodomo, founding director of the University of Vienna's Global African Diaspora Studies.

Bodomo, who is one of the world's leading experts on China-Africa relations, said Beijing was ""shooting itself in the foot"" by meeting racism accusations out of Guangzhou with denials.

China's problem with racism is not limited to those with dark skin.

One European woman said she and her family were split apart at a restaurant in China, with her Chinese husband allowed inside while she had to remain outside.

""My husband is inside, eating lunch,"" she said. ""I have to stay outside, because I am a foreigner.""

Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of the California-based Chinese for Affirmative Action, said her group ""vehemently"" condemns reports of racism coming out of China, ""just in the way that we condemn the kind of anti-Asian racism that we're experiencing here in the United States.""

""You're no more likely to carry the virus or be responsible for the virus based on your race, ethnicity or national origin,"" she said.

The number of reported crimes against Asian-Americans has been rising in the U.S., with more than 1,700 instances reported since March. A video that sparked outrage months ago appears to show an Asian-American woman being targeted for not wearing a mask.

They're doing it for an audience of one — Donald Trump.

China hawks have always fought to get Trump to take an even harder line on China, but he's often put his hopes of signing a trade deal with China first.

By turning this anti-China conspiracy theory into a talking point on Trump's favorite TV shows and in his political circles, though, hawks could win Trump to their side. It's worked before.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In recent weeks Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been making the rounds on the conservative media circuit, spreading the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus may have escaped from a Chinese government laboratory in Wuhan. He's started getting in fights with mainstream media about it too.

The scientific consensus is that the virus was not man made, and US intelligence agencies have said that there's no evidence that the virus escaped from a lab instead of occurring naturally and spreading to an open market in Wuhan.

Still, Pompeo insists he has evidence to support his theory, though he hasn't provided any. High ranking members of the GOP, like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, have spread the idea on conservative media outlets as well.

Maybe they believe this stuff. And maybe they have evidence they plan on showing the American people eventually. But given how blatantly Pompeo dodges the evidence question when it's raised in mainstream media, it's more likely they're just performing for an audience of one — President Donald Trump.

By turning this theory about the virus' creation into a Fox News talking point, Republicans who want the president to be more aggressive towards China can feed it to Trump through his favorite filter. That, in turn, could harden his stance on China.

Trump has a history of going softer on China than the hawkish in his administration and in his party would like, and on issues that really matter. Instead of listening to the hawks, he takes a softer stance often recommended by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other more business-focused officials working on the US trade deal with China, Trump's obsession.

For example, Congress unanimously passed bills in December condemning China for its treatment of Uighur Muslims and for its anti-democratic encroachment on civil liberties in Hong Kong. For any normal White House this would be an obvious moment to stand up for human rights, but Trump didn't voice support for either cause.

And in between complaining about the unfairness that prompted him to start a trade war with China, Trump has always professed to like and respect Chinese President Xi Jinping. He's maintained that in press conferences throughout this pandemic.

For a time Trump insisted on calling the coronavirus the ""Wuhan virus,"" in an attempt to retaliate when a Chinese diplomat started spreading the conspiracy theory that it came from the US. But after a meeting of G20 world leaders at the end of March he pulled back from that.

Trump came out of that G20 meeting talking about how many ventilators the US would soon sell to other countries — as if COVID-19 were a businesses opportunity, a deal. It's clear that he would like to get back to that as soon as possible. That's why he's trying to declare victory over the virus and open up the economy again. He wants to get back to what his presidency used to be, and that includes spending his time haggling over soybeans with China.

That return to normalcy is just not ideal for Washington's China hawks — not with anger at China increasing around the world. Countries like the UK and Australia are calling for an inquiry into the origins of the virus. And if Trump is more focused on getting a trade deal from China, he may not be as supportive.

The idea that China unleashed the virus on the world and refuses to take responsibility for it, though, may be enough to sustain Trump's anger so that he continues to listen to hawks like Pompeo, sidelining pragmatists like Mnuchin.

Trump's habit of regurgitating ideas he's heard in conservative media circles is well documented. Most recently, Axios reports that Trump has taken to questioning the official COVID-19 death toll. It's a theory that got conservative talking heads Diamond and Silk kicked off of Fox News, but it's been floating around the right wing since death tolls started rising in the US at the end of March.

So filtering an idea that could harden Trump's stance on China through his favorite TV shows could work. In fact, it could be working right now.",real

Sanctions against the Iraqi oil industry were immediately dropped and dozens of Western companies rushed in to make money.

A barrister representing a British businessman accused of bribing an Iraqi oil official has told a trial in London the evidence against him included the ""flimsiest of innuendos.""

Adrian Eissa QC said his client, Stephen Whiteley, 65, had not been a party to any corrupt payments made by his employer, Monaco-based Unaoil via an intermediary, Basil al-Jarah.

Adrian Eissa QC tells jury evidence against his client is ""flimsy innuendo"". Stephen Whiteley and two others deny bribing Iraqi oil officials to get $800m contracts after the fall of Saddam Hussein. (Trial has been moved from Southwark Crown Court because of social distancing)... — Total Crime (@totalcrime) May 21, 2020

​Whiteley is accused, along with Ziad Akle, 45, and Paul Bond, 68, of conspiracy to give corrupt payments to Oday Al Quoraishi, an official in Iraq’s state-owned South Oil Company in return for a lucrative contract for single point moorings (SPM) equipment between 2009 and 2010.

Akle and Whiteley are also accused of bribing Al Quoraishi - who was nicknamed Ivan because of his predilection for Russian women - for an oil pipeline contract.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which has brought the prosecution, claims a total of US$6 million (£4.7 million) was offered to Al Quoraishi in exchange for contracts worth a total of $800 million.

All three men deny the charges. Their trial began at Southwark Crown Court in London in January but was halted for nine weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak and has now resumed at the Old Bailey in central London.

At the start of the trial the prosecutor, Martin Brompton QC, said: ""This case concerns bribery and corruption connected to the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry in the years following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003.”

Mr Brompton said: ""By the time of Saddam’s overthrow, the infrastructure required for the successful production and distribution of crude oil and dilapidated. Plans were made by the Iraqi ministry of oil to hugely increase the country’s oil producing industry.""

Iraq sought to expand its production of oil from 1.8 million barrels per day to 4.5 million bpd and needed to build more pipelines and facilities for oil tankers.

Mr Brompton claimed Unaoil’s role was to seek to get the SPM contract for SBM Offshore, a Netherlands-based company who Paul Bond worked for, and Leighton Offshore, a Singapore firm and he claimed bribes were paid.

On Thursday, 21 May, Mr Eissa led the jury through a number of emails which were at the heart of the prosecution case.

He said one email referred to Whiteley giving Al Quoraishi a “good night out” in London in October 2009 and he said the prosecution sought to imply that because of that he must have known about the corrupt payments.

But Mr Eissa said the prosecution’s case was built on the “flimsiest of innuendos”.

Mr Eissa said his client was only on the “periphery” of the pipeline deal which had its own project manager, Peter Willimont.

Mr Eissa said that explained why Whiteley was not cc’d into numerous emails about Unaoil’s projects in Iraq and he said his client was “on the outside looking in.”

He said Whiteley had “zero motivation” to get involved in the pipeline deal and Mr Eissa pointed to several emails which made it clear that his client was “focusing on Angola”, where Unaoil was seeking to make money from that country’s oil industry.

When the SFO launched an investigation into Unaoil in 2017 Whiteley “volunteered” to be interviewed by them.

Mr Eissa said: “He said he had attended a presentation in Dubai and that was all about Iraq. It’s not his fault that the SFO did not answer any follow-up questions. If he had something to hide about his work in Iraq why would he mention the presentation in Dubai?”

Mr Eissa, finishing his closing speech to the jury, told them: “If you have a doubt about Mr Whiteley’s guilt, hang on to it and guard it jealously because we say a proper analysis of evidence shows Stephen Whiteley is not guilty on both counts.”

When Akle gave evidence in March - before the trial was suspended because of the coronavirus outbreak - he claimed he had “sweated blood” to ensure the success of Iraq’s oil expansion project and said he feared a “stitch-up” by deputy oil minister Ahmed al-Shamaa.

Akle said he believed al-Shamaa wanted to derail SOC’s plans and take over the pipeline and SPM project for himself.

The indictments against Akle, Whiteley and Bond also named several other alleged co-conspirators who are not on trial. They include the founder of Unaoi, Ata Ahsani and his sons Cyrus and Saman, Mr Willimont, Basil al-Jarah and two of Bond’s “bosses” at SBM - Patrick Chapalain and Stephane Montbarbon.

Howard Godfrey QC, representing Bond, said his client - a former woodwork teacher - was not an “intellectual” and had been “taken for a ride” by his bosses.

He said: “Our case is that Paul Bond is a thoroughly decent, straight, honest guy who has got completely out of his depth with what was going on around him.”

Mr Godfrey said Bond worked extremely hard, staying up late at night and even making a “dangerous trip” to Basra in Iraq in an attempt to win the SPM contract and he said Bond was blissfully unaware of any corruption or bribes.

Referring to the trip to Basra, Mr Godfrey said: “Do you think he would have worked so had if he had known that thanks to the al-Jarah bribe it was a done deal? It makes no sense.”

The jury is expected to retire and consider its verdict next week.",fake

“What we are seeing in our treatment center is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in (Aden),” MSF’s operations manager for Yemen Caroline Seguin said Thursday.

Since March 2015, Yemen has been heavily invaded by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, trying to restore power to ex-Yemeni president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi.

The Saudi coalition also aims to crush the popular Houthi Ansarullah movement, whose fighters have helped the Yemeni army defend the country against the invaders.

Ceaseless Saudi airstrikes and the destruction wrought by the kingdom's mercenaries and armed militia loyal to Hadi have wiped out much of Yemen’s infrastructure, destroying hospitals, schools, and factories.

The COVID-19 disease has further deteriorated the humanitarian situation in the impoverished country, where 80 percent of the population are reliant on international aid for survival.

Early this week, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that Yemen’s health system was already under heavy stress and would now be overwhelmed “if COVID-19 continues to spread.”

The so-called regime led by Hadi in Aden has since April 10 announced 180 infections and 30 deaths from the coronavirus.

But the MSF said Thursday that its center in Aden had admitted 173 patients from April 30 to May 17, at least 68 of whom had lost their lives, suggesting “a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city.”

Even so, inadequate testing capacity made it hard to pin down exact numbers but dying patients “clearly have the symptoms of COVID-19”, it said.

The MSF said endemic diseases like malaria and dengue “never produced so many deaths in such a short amount of time” in the Arab country.

“People are coming to us too late to save, and we know that many more people are not coming at all: they are just dying at home,” the medical charity further said.

The trial, previously scheduled for mid-March, was postponed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus and is set to kick off at 13:00 GMT. Netanyahu is expected to arrive at the court accompanied by a retinue of bodyguards and security personnel as well as several of his loyalists, members of his party Likud.

Despite initial reports that the trial would be aired live, Israel's High Court ruled that the general public will not be able to see what is arguably the most scandalous affair in the nation's history

Instead, reporters who would usually be positioned inside the courtroom, will now need to settle for a room on another floor, away from the action, watching the hearing from a TV screen. This is a definite relief for Netanyahu, who wanted to avoid being seen as a criminal standing up in front of judges just like any other ordinary citizen.

Crime Minister?

The only problem is that most of the nation already sees him as such. A 2019 poll released after Netanyahu's cases were made public showed that 55 percent of Israelis considered the PM corrupt. At the same time, the survey also highlighted the disbelief Israel's public felt towards Attorney General Avichai Mandelblitt, who indicted the prime minister, with 45 percent of respondents saying they had little trust in him and the judiciary system he represented.

Soon after the AG rolled out his indictment in November 2019, accusing the PM in a series of graft probes, people took to the streets across the country accusing him of joining forces with left-wing circles in a bid to bring Netanyahu down.

Similar protests are expected later today in front of the court where the trial is set to take place. At least a 1,000 Netanyahu supporters are slated to arrive to back the PM and send a clear message to the judiciary that their ""biased"" actions are considered illegitimate.

They won't be alone. A year ago, a poll conducted by the newspaper Israel Hayom, found that 61 percent of Israelis believed the President of the country's High Court Esther Hayout held left-wing views which influenced her decisions. Similar findings have also been made about other players in the system including the deputy attorney general and state prosecutor.

Now, however, Netanyahu supporters are also afraid that the judges set to hear the PM's case will also be biased against him. Their primary concern is aimed at Rivka Freedman-Feldman. In 2015, she found former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert guilty of bribery, and loyalists of the current PM are concerned that history might repeat itself.

What to Expect?

Today's hearing is not expected to take very long. It will start with Prosecutor Liat Ben Ari reading out her accusations, with Netanyahu expected to answer whether he understands the meaning of what was put out in front of him, while his defence is set to refute all accusations against their client, proclaiming the PM's innocence.

But the more advanced stages of the trial, where judges are expected to go through hundreds of documents and hear 333 witnesses from the prosecution in addition to a long list from the defence, could take up to two years, if sessions are held once or twice a week.

Given that the cases are so important and full of information, requiring time and preparation, the judges might decide to space out the hearings, stretching out the process for ages.

Netanyahu, however, is not planning to sit on his hands. Appointing loyalist Amir Ohana as homeland security minister, the prime minister secured access to the nation's most delicate and sensitive probes and obtained a means to rattle the judiciary by interfering in police investigations.

Benjamin Netanyahu is facing charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in a series of graft probes but denies any wrongdoing.

In what's known as case 4000, the most significant of the three, he is accused of buying positive press in one of Israel's leading websites Walla in exchange for promoting the interests of the site's owner Shaul Alovich.

In case 2000, Netanyahu is also accused of attempting to buy positive coverage for himself and his family, this time from Noni Mozes, the owner of news conglomerate Yedioth Ahronot.

Unlike case 4000, where the PM allegedly bribed Alovich, the case with Mozes is lighter as Netanyahu is only accused of breaching the trust of the public by not rejecting Mozes' proposal and considering to impose a series of regulations that would harm Yedioth Ahronot's main competitor.

In case 1000, the prosecution wants to hold Netanyahu accountable for receiving almost $200,000 worth of gifts from a rich donor, including cigars, pink champagne, and jewels in exchange for letting Arnon Milchin evade taxes.",fake

The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the end of 2021, the EC report says. According to European Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, “Europe is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression.” The European Commissioner said that the scale of the economic downturn and the speed of economic recovery would vary for different EU regions and would depend on how quickly a country would lift quarantine measures, how much a country depends on tourism as well as on the general state of its economy. “These differences pose a threat to the single market and the Eurozone,” the official said. What’s your take on this?

Rumen Gechev: At this stage, the EC estimates seem quite objective, provided that in the next two to three months the main restrictions caused by COVID-19 will be lifted. GDP will fall by at least 10-12% as a result of a serious decline in investment and consumption, severely hampered exports in the EU – and especially outside the EU – as well as rapidly growing unemployment and a chain of bankruptcy cases. Of course, the scale of the crisis will vary depending on the structure of individual national economies and their external logistics chains. The EC and the ECB, which have learned from the mistake of pursuing austerity policies during the previous crisis of 2007-2009, have now taken the right path providing companies and households with large-scale liquidity by issuing interest-free loans, credit guarantees and easing loan guarantee requirements, gratuitous assistance, as well by issuing direct and indirect subsidies. The EC announced that it was temporarily abandoning the restrictions imposed on budget deficit size and the share of government debt on GDP. The green light was also given to provide state assistance to private companies.

However, such relaxation can have a very high price. The Eurozone has somewhat “slowed down;” it had faced serious economic and financial problems even before the crisis started. Despite banking control tightening, many Eurozone banks have ended up in turbulent conditions. For example, Deutsche Bank has suffered huge losses for several years, while it directly or indirectly controls more than $2 trillion worth of assets in Germany, the EU, the US and other countries.

The bankruptcy of tens of thousands of firms and the increase in unemployment means that a critically large number of legal entities and individuals won’t be able to service their loans. This time, unlike the previous crisis, governments won’t be able to allocate budgetary funds to help banks that find themselves in a difficult situation. Firstly, because budget expenditures have already increased significantly, and secondly, because taxpayers won’t agree to again help banks with their own money. The situation is worsening because even before the crisis, countries didn’t agree on a new EU budget for 2020 due to increased internal disagreements after Brexit. It turned out that Germany and France, especially Germany, didn’t want to increase their contribution to the EU budget. After that, it became clear that expectations regarding some kind of general fiscal policy, including creating a Eurozone finance ministry, were unrealistic. Plans to issue debt securities are unlikely to be realized because, at this stage, Germany and the Netherlands categorically refuse to allocate their national budget resources for that. Thus, a common fight against COVID-19 is impossible without the overall financing of anti-crisis measures. And it is precisely this lack of solidarity that poses the greatest danger to the Eurozone. This is an extremely big risk, even in the medium term. If this risk is not minimized, if it is not possible to reach solutions acceptable to everyone, another serious Eurozone crisis could lead to the collapse of the European Union.

Sputnik: Which European countries do you think will suffer the most, and who will most easily get through the post-coronavirus economic depression? Is out of sync recovery really a threat to the EU single market? What should be done? Is it urgently “pouring” additional EU funds into the economies of the countries that would suffer most, or is there any other option?

Rumen Gechev: The real results of the crisis will become clear at least in a few months. The countries that are likely to suffer the most are states with the highest share of tourism in their GDP – Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Bulgaria, etc., as well as countries with hub airports, and therefore with large passenger flows.

In the long run, this crisis cannot be resolved only through money injections. At the moment, this is exactly what EU governments are doing, of course, with some slight differences in volume and tools.

The EU’s foreign economic relations, production organization and sustainability amid such an external shock should be comprehensively reevaluated; this especially concerns key industries that ensure regional and national security. Some production facilities are most likely to be withdrawn from China, or substitute capacities will be created in the EU. This is a chance for countries such as Bulgaria: countries that may be suitable for such a relocation of production capacity. This is probably a chance for real progress towards convergence between less and more developed European economies, which has been proclaimed for many years. Without reducing technological and socio-economic differences, it is impossible to overcome the dangerous stagnation in integration processes.

Talking to Russian RBC, Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said:

“Today, they often say that there is no leader in global politics and several countries claim this role. This situation creates new opportunities for the European Union, given its reputation as a player capable of offering constructive solutions to problems, acting in different directions and in the most difficult situations.”

Sputnik: Considering difficult Sino-American relations, can the EU in the post-COVID era become the new global leader, or is it just flaunting amid the difficult situation with the coronavirus, where the EU started responding quite late, which has in due time caused discontent in Italy, for example?

Rumen Gechev: Unfortunately, the EU won’t be able to take the opportunity of being a global leader. If Germany is excluded, other leading countries (France, Italy, Spain) remain captive to fiscal deficits, debts, and worsening social and domestic political problems. Italy’s banking and fiscal system was already on the razor’s edge, and now it needs to solve the terrifying problems cause by the coronavirus. France is also facing a serious challenge. Every government’s attempt to reform pensions, for example, faces mass protests of “Yellow Vests” on Champs Elysees. And as soon as quarantine restrictions are lifted, protests are likely to continue. Yes, the EU is a significant economic centre in the global economy, but its weight in international politics doesn’t correspond to economic opportunities. For example, the prospects of creating a common EU army are far-fetched; and without its own army, the EU will continue to depend on NATO.

Sputnik: In 2019, Bulgaria rated first in terms of military spending growth, due to its purchase of American F-16s. At the same time, according to Eurostat, Bulgaria has the lowest minimum wage in the EU (€312). According to a study by the 24 Chasa newspaper, Bulgarian pensions are among the lowest not only in the EU, but also in the Balkans. Why do you think the government decided to purchase the aircraft, the price of which greatly exceeded the original maximum? Both President Rumen Radev and many MPS pointed to the fact that the deal implied reduced opportunities, but Valentin Radev from the ruling GERB Party noted that that purchase brought Bulgaria closer to NATO, its strategic partner, where the United States is “the front man.” Do you think the choice is due primarily to this, or is Sofia really facing serious security challenges?

Rumen Gechev: Bulgaria is a NATO member, and it should fulfil its obligations under the treaty. But it should be clarified that this should be mutually beneficial; as for the F-16 case, there are several serious problems. Firstly, according to experts, this model has exhausted its capabilities, even in the new Block 70 modification. Therefore, the Pentagon hasn’t bought this aircraft for more than five years. It seems that we’ve become part of a marketing strategy to extend the old product’s life cycle. Secondly, the price for Bulgaria is now higher than for other buyers. The explanation that this is so because the F-16 is supposedly our first purchase seems rather strange. Thirdly, in order to avoid a higher price – higher than what had previously been approved by the parliament – the government resorted to removing part of the armament and manning. In other words, additional costs will now follow. Fourthly, we are buying a modification that still exists only on paper. What are the guarantees that the product will be successful when its delivery actually becomes possible? What are the guarantees that there will be no delays, as was the case with the F-35, for example? Fifthly, the fact that such an extremely expensive product has only six months of warranty, which is four times less than the warranty for electrical appliances in the EU, is a scandal. Sixthly, we paid the full price in advance – both for the drawing and for the promise to deliver the aircraft from 2023. But it recently became known that deliveries can actually last until January 2027! That is, the people of Bulgaria pay the whole amount in advance and receive equipment in 7-8 years. Here, as they say, common sense fails to appreciate the so-called Euro-Atlantic solidarity, which is unilaterally served by the current Bulgarian government.

Sputnik: The other day, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said that Sofia could block the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia’s joining the EU if Skopje didn’t comply with the Treaty of Good-Neighbourliness. At the same time, the EU called on Northern Macedonia to comply with the terms of the treaty. In your opinion, can Bulgaria arrange a “Greek” scenario for Skopje? Recall that Athens has for many years blocked the Euro-Atlantic integration of its northern neighbour. Or, if the leading EU countries are determined to give Northern Macedonia the green light, will Sofia remove the conditions and stop arguing with its Western EU partners?

Rumen Gechev: For Bulgaria, the issue of Macedonia is extremely sensitive, since the land and population of this country are part of our historical past; today we speak different dialects of the same language. Of course, part of Northern Macedonian political elite has a different opinion and defends its own interests. We have irrefutable historical evidence that they steal our history, the history of Bulgaria. We cannot agree that the Bulgarian kings and historical figures are declared Macedonians and that their history books are full of distorted historical facts. Therefore, I would say that, unfortunately, the government led by Borisov hasn’t repeated the Greek scenario. Greece first resolved historical disputes with its Macedonian partners, including the issue of imitation monuments in Skopje, for example, the monument to Alexander the Great (according to the Prespa Agreement, monuments to the family of Alexander the Great should have signs explaining that the monuments belong to ancient history, which belongs to Greece), and only then gave the green light for Northern Macedonia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. The Bulgarian government first signed an agreement (on friendship, good neighbourliness and cooperation) promising to show historical tolerance to historical truth, and then waited for adequate steps from Northern Macedonia. Unfortunately, such steps didn’t follow and probably won’t follow. The problem is that the current government, trying to please Brussels and remain in power, may not use our right to veto Northern Macedonia’s entering the EU. I am convinced that most Bulgarians would consider such steps (no veto) national treason.

Sputnik: At the online EU-Western Balkans summit in early May, there was no question of the date of the start of negotiations on Northern Macedonia and Albania’s joining the EU, although back in 2018, Jean-Claude Juncker said that the Balkan candidates could consider 2025 as the date of their possible accession to the European Union, as soon as they fulfilled the necessary conditions. Do you think the situation with COVID-19 and the economic recession will alienate the prospects for Balkan countries’ joining the EU? Which country do you think is the most promising candidate, Serbia, Montenegro or Albania?

Rumen Gechev: Covid-19 will undoubtedly slow down the process of Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro’s accession to the EU. At this stage, due to a variety of reasons, the issue of Serbia is out of the question. A slowdown is inevitable due to the fact that the EU doesn’t think about expansion. It has to deal with very serious economic and political problems in order to pay more attention to the periphery in the Balkans. The differences between the western and eastern EU countries are still significant. Brussels has serious political disagreements with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland over the judicial system, migrant problems, the Istanbul Convention, their unwillingness to join the Eurozone, and so on. The EU is literally in a fever of problems, and Albania, Northern Macedonia and Montenegro’s accession is likely to make the situation even worse. In addition, two Balkan EU members, Greece and Bulgaria, have their own “preferences.” Greece would like to support Montenegro, while Bulgaria would prefer Northern Macedonia to Albania and Montenegro. First of all, you need to see whether the Eurozone can withstand the crisis and whether the EC finds a clear path and tools to continue building a common European home. Before that, there are unlikely to be any real steps to accept new members.

© Sputnik / Sergei Guneev Russian President Vladimir Putin Speaking at the launching ceremony of TurkStream pipeline

Sputnik: You have repeatedly called for lifting anti-Russia sanctions, indicating that of the EU member states, Bulgaria suffered the most from these economic measures. You also noted that at the same time, countries like Germany maintain economic relations with Russia, participating in the Nord Stream-2 project, while Bulgaria has buried the South Stream. In your opinion, can Turkstream somehow make up for these losses? Can it be that maybe the post-coronavirus era and the economic difficulties that accompany it are a good reason to lift various restrictive measures?

Rumen Gechev: Yes, both in our parliament and in the media I expressed the opinion that serving foreign economic interests entailed huge economic losses; we missed out on exceptional advantages. Because gas pipelines shouldn’t be seen only as transit fees sources, even if it is several hundred million euros per year. They would provide the economy with a stable supply (of energy resources) at preferential prices. After the failure of South Stream, we still have the opportunity to connect to the Turkstream, which our Prime Minister somewhat guilty calls “Balkan”. But no matter how we call it, we will now need to pay transit fees and margins to Turkey; but it could have been the other way around. It’s clear that the current Bulgarian government will strongly support anti-Russia sanctions so that it remains in power. For several consecutive years, nuclear reactors for Belene NPPs have been stored in a warehouse, almost two billion euros have been invested (in 2018, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences published a report on Belene, saying that Bulgaria had invested 3 billion levs, or about €1.54 billion). And while the Czech Republic and Hungary expand the possibilities of using peaceful atomic energy with the help of Rosatom, our authorities still keep frozen billions in a promising investment project, a project that would provide Bulgarian companies and households with clean electricity at competitive prices. One can only hope that COVID-19 will bring something positive to relations between the EU and Russia. Looking at the development of macroeconomic indicators, the approaching mass bankruptcies and problems in banks, I think that pressure from EU members regarding sanctions lifting will only increase. The statements of the political leaders of Germany, France and Italy are encouraging in this direction. Lifting the sanctions would simplify the restructuring and adaptation of our economy to new conditions, as well as allow the completion of significant and, I would say, pained Bulgarian-Russian investment projects.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says that the island nation has defeated — for the present — the coronavirus as her government announced the lifting of some restrictions imposed to halt the spread of COVID-19.

""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Ardern said Monday. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""

Asked whether New Zealand had eliminated COVID-19, Ardern replied: ""currently.""

The coronavirus has been trending down in New Zealand since April 5, when 89 confirmed cases were announced. On Sunday, there were no new cases announced for the first time in weeks, but another five were reported on Monday. A total of 19 people have died in New Zealand from COVID-19.

The country's director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said the small number of new cases in recent days ""does give us confidence that we have achieved our goal of elimination.""

Bloomfield and Ardern said that declaring the virus eliminated did not mean there would be no new cases, but that the numbers would be manageable with the help of aggressive contact tracing, which the prime minister said had been scaled up ""significantly"" with the capacity to make up to 10,000 calls per day.

Ardern's remarks came as New Zealand, a country of just 5 million people, downgraded its COVID-19 alert to level 3 — meaning most, but not all, businesses are being allowed to reopen.

Businesses and professions that require face-to-face contact — such as hairdressers, salespeople, masseuses and public gyms — will remain closed until the alert level is reduced another notch, Ardern said.

""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""

Exceptions include supermarkets, dairies, gas stations, pharmacies or other permitted health services, according to the New Zealand Herald.

For those who return to the physical workplace, they should maintain 1 meter (about 3 feet) of social distancing, Ardern said.

""COVID-19 has spread in workplaces, so the quid pro quo of being able to open is doing it in a way that doesn't spread the virus,"" she said.

The prime minister also advised that if people can work from home, they should continue to do so.

New Zealand has garnered praise for largely putting aside politics in order to tackle the outbreak.

As NPR's Julie McCarthy reports, Ardern, 39, a mother of a 21-month-old, ""regularly appears on Facebook Live chats, dressed in a sweatshirt, commiserating with families enduring isolation in their 'bubble,' as she calls their place of shelter, and assuring children the tooth fairy is still on the job. When she imposed stringent stay-home rules in late March, she urged people to 'be strong and be kind.' ""

Australia has also seen a precipitous decline in new cases since a peak nearly a month ago.

Speaking on Sunday, Australia's home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, suggested that New Zealand and Australia could reopen travel between them even as restrictions on inbound air passengers from other countries remained.

""You could look at an arrangement with New Zealand given they're at a comparable stage as we are in the fight against this virus,"" Dutton told Sky News, as reported by Radio New Zealand. ""You could look at other nations in our region if they've enjoyed the same success, but New Zealand might be the natural partner.""",real

However, both companies warn that the impact will be felt over the current quarter ending in June. Namely, Samsung and LG expect customers to cut back significantly on TV and smartphone purchases.

In Q1, Samsung’s net profit was down slightly compared to the same quarter last year, but revenue was up 5.6 percent overall thanks to strong demand for its server and mobile components. The company said that some of its customers are restocking their chip supplies because of supply uncertainty, Reuters notes. Mobile profitability was also up, although shipments were down. Meanwhile, LG’s net profit rose 88 percent compared to the same quarter last year, despite sales being down 1.3 percent. LG credited the strength of its home-appliance division for offsetting sluggish television and smartphone performance.

Demand for Samsung’s memory chips is expected to “remain solid”

In the current quarter running from April to June, Samsung and LG both warn of a decline in demand for items like TVs and smartphones. Reuters reports that Samsung expects mobile and TV profits to “decline significantly.” Similarly, LG’s earnings presentation warns of a “sharp” drop for televisions, and for demand of mobile phones to “decline significantly” compared to the same quarter a year earlier.

There are areas where the ongoing pandemic is increasing demand for Samsung’s and LG’s products, however, as a result of people working and studying from home. For example, Samsung said it expects demand for its memory chips to “remain solid” as sales of servers and PCs remain high. LG’s business solutions division, which includes its monitors and PCs, is also expecting strong demand.

Nevertheless, Samsung and LG are expecting the pandemic to take its toll on future results. Samsung said that overall earnings are expected to decline due to a decreased demand for “core products,” and LG said it also expects a drop in both sales and profits next quarter.

With financial markets in turmoil, and countries only just starting to “flatten the curve” enough to consider restarting their economies, it’s hard to predict the future. “There will be some time needed for the real economy to actually recover,” said Jong-min Lee, vice president of Samsung’s mobile unit. “It’s difficult for us to see how much of a decrease in demand we’ll see in the second quarter.”",real

There have been few winners in the March quarter, although companies are expected to fare better over the following three months, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data on 2,087 companies found. Profit is expected to decline 27% in the quarter to the end of June.

The data showed that about 73% of Asian firms have reported their March quarter earnings so far.

“We are optimistic that China will lead the Asian region out of its depressed state. It will likely show a modest recovery in sales and profits in Q2, and a strong bounce ... from Q3 onwards,” Khiem Do, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management, said.

“The rest of the Asian region will follow suit, most probably from Q3 onwards.”

In the March quarter, oil companies cumulatively posted losses for the first time in at least a decade as oil prices slumped because cars remained parked and planes were grounded.

China’s top two oil companies, PetroChina (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS), posted record losses.

Airlines reported their biggest losses in at least 10 years, and profit at companies that depend on discretionary spending, such as automakers, slumped 94%. Companies that supply machinery reported an 83% fall in profit as factories were shut.

Among the outliers was Chinese tech giant Tencent (0700.HK) as people spent money on its games and social media sites.

“There are very early signs that the cuts in earnings forecasts have started to show signs of coming to some end,” Herald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC, said.

Analysts, according to Refinitiv data, cut their profit forecast for the next 12 months by 2% in the past 30 days. In the 30 days before that, they lowered their estimate by 9% for the period.

At a Senate hearing this week, Anthony Fauci noted that a vaccine — which is probably months or years away — isn’t the only way to protect someone from a life-threatening virus.

These treatments could protect people against infection for a few weeks or months, said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. While most ongoing research studies are focused on finding treatments for people who are already sick with COVID-19, some researchers are looking to see if they can stop people who are at high risk from getting sick in the first place.

It’s a proven strategy: preventive drugs have been used for decades to help people protect themselves against malaria. More recently, they were a breakthrough in the fight against HIV. There’s no effective vaccine against HIV, but people can take a daily medication that reduces their risk of contracting it through sexual activity by 99 percent. The medication is a pre-exposure prophylactic, or PrEP — a drug used to prevent disease in people who haven’t yet been exposed to it.

“We have an incredibly powerful tool that can, for myself personally, protect me from HIV,” says James Krellenstein, co-founder of the PrEP4All Collaboration and an organizer of a COVID-19 working group in New York.

Krellenstein published a report this week outlining the clinical trials underway to find drugs that can prevent COVID-19. Viruses make people sick when they replicate and spread through the body, and most anti-viral drugs are designed to stop that replication process. Giving someone the drug early, when there’s only a small number of virus particles in the body, is going to be more effective than waiting until the virus is everywhere, Caleb Skipper, an infectious disease postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota, told The Verge. In theory, a drug could be even more effective if it’s already in the body when the first virus appears.

Skipper is part of a research team at the University of Minnesota running a clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine, which can stop the coronavirus from replicating in a test tube, can help keep health care workers from catching COVID-19. The drug has been the subject of a lot of controversy and hasn’t been able to effectively treat people who are already sick and hospitalized.

The majority of clinical trials looking at preventive drugs now are testing hydroxychloroquine, Krellenstein found. He argues that research into prophylactics needs to cast a wider net and look at other candidates, too. “Vaccines are much an art as a science, and there’s a lot of hit and miss. It would be substantial if we could identify a molecular compound that could really inhibit COVID-19 acquisition,” he says.

Some researchers are looking outside of hydroxychloroquine. At Johns Hopkins, researchers are testing to see if convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich blood of COVID-19 survivors, could be protective. A trial testing how well it protects people who have been exposed to the novel coronavirus from becoming sick will start enrolling participants next week.

“You could imagine everyone in a meatpacking plant could get this. You could imagine everyone in the White House could get this, people at high risk,” says David Sullivan, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, who’s involved in the plasma research. “It’s a way for those critical people to get immediate immunity.”

The trial will test if the plasma confers protection, and if it does, how long it might last. “Plasma is a single dose — you could go in and get it once and have protection for a month, or six weeks,” Sullivan says. “We think that this is one of the essential steps to returning us to a functioning society. But we have to demonstrate that it works.”

If plasma helps prevent COVID-19, it could be a sign that more refined antibody treatments might also be useful as protection, he says. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to identify the antibodies that are most effective at blocking the novel coronavirus. Then, they’d be able to produce a more targeted cocktail of virus-blocking substances than plasma, which is a general mix of all the antibodies a sick person’s body creates. “Convalescent plasma is the first step towards other products,” Sullivan says.

Both plasma and antibodies typically require IV infusions, so the logistics of providing them to people at risk of contracting COVID-19 is challenging — although it may only need to be given once to confer some level of protection. Hydroxychloroquine is a pill, so it’s simpler for people to take, but may have to be taken daily.

Sullivan thinks that the limitations aren’t insurmountable. And identifying drugs that can protect people from the novel coronavirus is a critical step toward controlling the pandemic, he says.

“It’s all hands on deck treating people who are sick. That has to be done,” Sullivan says. But the best way to help people is to keep them from getting sick in the first place. It could also help them feel safer leaving the house. “If I have a treatment that shortens hospitalization, I’m still going to worry about going out and about, if it means I might have to go to the hospital,” he says.

Treatments are important, Sullivan says, but they help put out fires that are already raging. “Prophylaxis is like throwing water on a box of matches,” he says. “Wet matches aren’t going to light in the first place.”",real

Will government mandate COVID-19 vaccinations? – When a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, I will be one of the first in line. But the fact is U.S. adults tend to have low vaccination rates. If the government determines that vaccinations are essential to stemming the spread of the disease, would it – could it – mandate vaccination compliance? Apparently, it can — and it might.

Many medical experts believe that developing one or more COVID-19 vaccines is the key to reopening the economy and returning to our normal lives. For example, the Mayo Clinic says, “A vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic.” – READ MORE

According to the New York Daily News, the agency will begin using powerful ultraviolet light as part of its beefed-up sanitization program on subways and buses. The effort is part of a partnership with Columbia University, which theorizes that UV light can be used to kill diseases on the transit system.

Starting May 11th, UV lamps will be placed inside subway cars and buses at two rail yards and bus depots. The lamps emit rays called “UVC,” a relatively obscure part of the spectrum that consists of a shorter, more energetic wavelength of light that can be harmful to humans if exposed directly.

The lamps emit rays called “UVC,” a relatively obscure part of the spectrum

UVC is particularly good at killing organic material — whether in humans or viral particles — but the jury is still out on whether it can be effective in destroying the novel coronavirus. UVC lamps and robots are commonly used to sanitize water, objects such as laboratory equipment, and spaces such as buses and airplanes. If the MTA results are good, transit officials said they will expand it to include more trains and buses.

“At this critical and unprecedented time, the MTA is exploring every solution scientists and the market have to offer in our effort to ensure the transportation system is safe for our customers and employees,” said Mark Dowd, MTA chief innovation officer, in a statement. “The pilot project involving this proven UV technology is another example of that as we look for alternative ways to effectively reduce risk on train cars and buses. We thank Columbia University for its partnership and are hopeful this new technology in transit provides a more effective and efficient option than our current disinfecting efforts.”

President Donald Trump infamously touted ultraviolet light and disinfectant as potential treatments for people who are sick with COVID-19, despite both being very harmful to humans. The president later claimed that he was being sarcastic.

Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the extraordinary step of shutting down subway service from 1AM to 5AM every evening starting on May 6th for extensive disinfecting.

The MTA has reported a 90 percent drop in ridership since the start of the pandemic, with the agency curtailing some train and bus service to address the drop in demand. Many essential workers still count on transit to get to and from work every day. So far, over 80 MTA employees have died from the virus.

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

When Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.

""I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,"" he told ABC News.

Evie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Howard Smith visits his wife, Lois, a 77-year-old Alzheimer's patient, at the New Paltz Center nursing facility for the first time since lockdowns due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pine Bush, NY., May 5, 2020. Caitlin Ochs/Reuters

The COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.

With nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.

As coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.

""Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,"" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.

Alzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Still, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.

""Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,"" Johns said.

""[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,"" he added.

Johns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.

""For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,"" Johns told ABC News.

Coronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.

""It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,"" Ken Gregersen said.

Ken's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.

""I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,"" he said.

While Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.

""Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,"" he added.

Although Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.

""I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,"" he said.

""I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,"" he added.

Ken says he's satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect care facilities.

This week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities.

Johns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.

""We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,"" Johns said.

""It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,"" he added.

On Monday, President Donald Trump's administration also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities.

However, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.

But until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses and friends' faces confined to portable screens.

""Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face. She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it,"" Gregerson said.

It was supposed to be a long weekend of festivals and music culminating on April 20, or 4/20, the code for marijuana’s high holiday. Instead, it has been reduced to an online replica because of stay-at-home orders to curb the pandemic.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Virtual parties and video chats are replacing vast outdoor smoking sessions to mark the rise of legalization and celebrate cannabis culture. The origins of the annual celebration are believed tied to a group of Northern California high school friends, who used the code as slang for smoking pot in the early 1970s.

“Stay home,” the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, said bluntly. San Francisco Mayor London Breed threatened arrests: “We will not tolerate anyone coming to San Francisco for 4/20 this year.”

For businesses, 4/20 is usually their once-a-year Black Friday, when sales soar. Instead, they are reporting up-and-down buying and pondering an uncertain future.

The pandemic means the world economy could face its worst year since the Great Depression in the 1930s. In a sign of what’s to come, U.S. retail sales overall dropped nearly 9% in March — a record. Millions are out of work.

As for the holiday, “there’s a somber feeling to this one,” said Jordan Lams, CEO of Pure CA, which specializes in marijuana extracts and does business as Moxie brand products. Before the outbreak, “it was going to be the biggest 4/20 in history,” Lams said.

Steve White, CEO of Arizona-based Harvest Health & Recreation, said he’s watching to see if consumers treat marijuana more like beer or toilet paper when money runs short.

When the economy tumbles, beer sales traditionally spike. With toilet paper, panic-buying might empty shelves but people do not use more of it. They just buy less later.

It will be a telling year, because no one in the relatively new industry knows if sales will plunge, stay flat or even rise.

“Do people buy less cannabis, or does it become more ingrained as part of their daily life?” White said.

The uncertainty in the market poses the latest challenge for an industry that’s expanded in some form to all but a handful of states.

The risks are spotlighted in California, where businesses contend with hefty taxes, an illicit market that still dwarfs the legal one and a tourism-reliant economy that’s crippled by virus restrictions.

Because cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, most banks don’t want to do business with pot companies and they aren’t included in the coronavirus rescue package that will help other businesses.

Before the virus, “we were already teetering on ... an edge of a cannabis collapse,” said Los Angeles dispensary owner Jerred Kiloh, who heads the United Cannabis Business Association. “It’s going to be very difficult for cannabis businesses to make it through this pandemic.”

That’s despite the onset of stay-at-home orders in March that sent marijuana sales rocketing; some businesses reported single-day records as customers stocked up. New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles were among the cities that labeled dispensaries essential businesses that could remain open.

But since then, business generally has flattened or tapered off, even with deliveries and curbside pickups growing to reduce health risks. Marijuana data trackers BDS Analytics documented sales surges through much of March, but then consumers pulled back in late March and early April, with sales mostly below average.

In Oregon, cannabis retailers saw a huge spike last month — a 30% increase in average sales per retailer compared with March 2019. Sales increases mid-month were even larger.

However, the peak has leveled off and customers are coming in less frequently but buying more, said David Alport, who owns two Bridge City Collective stores in Portland. He’s hired three more employees to handle home deliveries.

In Illinois, marijuana businesses can keep operating under Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Companies made sweeping changes that included appointment-only sales and online ordering.

The Mission dispensary on Chicago’s South Side saw an initial spike in purchases before the lockdown took effect, but that’s leveled off.

“We’ve never faced an economic downturn when cannabis was legal,” said Kris Krane, president of Mission dispensaries. “This is completely unprecedented.”

Some customers could be especially vulnerable during an economic downturn. Among cannabis users in states where its legal, 32% have incomes below $35,000 and only 54% have full-time employment, according to BDS Analytics. Anyone on a tight budget might be more apt to avoid taxes that go with legal purchases and buy from illicit market dealers.

Steve DeAngelo, co-founder of Harborside dispensaries in California, said it’s difficult to predict what’s next, with no template for how cannabis consumers will react in a deep economic downturn.

Still, he notes that the industry has endured for years through times good and bad, even when consumers had only one option — illegal purchases. Consumers who see marijuana as part of their daily routine will keep coming back, he predicted.

But, for businesses, there will be a “sorting out,” DeAngelo said. Companies with strong brands and cash reserves are likely to fare better in a poor economy; those saddled with heavy debt who made too-rosy promises to investors will face challenges.

“There is not going to be an extinction moment,” DeAngelo said. “It’s going to prove more resilient than many, many other industries.”",real
1074,2017,http://widerimage.reuters.com/story/from-home-to-hospital-giving-birth-during-the-us-coronavirus-outbreak,,From home to hospital: giving birth during the U.S. coronavirus outbreak,"Advertisement

As a first-time mother with no idea what to expect, Nancy Pedroza was convinced the hospital was the safest place to have her baby.

That conviction turned to doubt when in late March most U.S. states ordered residents to stay home and hospitals and doctors began taking new precautions to protect pregnant women and their babies against the novel coronavirus sweeping the nation.

Pedroza holds on to Morgan as she experiences contractions while taking a brisk walk with Nichollette Jones, her doula, to speed up Pedroza's contractions. So, at 40 weeks pregnant, she turned to a midwife to help her have a home birth. She and her partner Ryan Morgan were about to become parents in the middle of a pandemic. ""Thing were changing so fast,"" said Pedroza, 27, who lives with her partner at her parents' house in Fort Worth, Texas. She had to go alone to all her visits with her obstetrician where before she had brought either Morgan, her father or a doula, a birth assistant.

Pedroza lies on a bed in front of Jones, Taylor and Morgan as he helps to pump her breastmilk to try and speed up her contractions. But what really scared her was the uncertainty of who would be allowed to stand by her side at the hospital when the baby came into the world. She would have to choose between Morgan and her doula. The hospital would allow only one and warned her the policy could change and it might bar all visitors. ""It was scary to feel like I might have to do it alone,"" she said, noting that the doctors and nurses were not the same as those who had supported her throughout her pregnancy. ""It's nothing like having someone there that you care about and cares about you that's willing to hold your hand and tell you this is going to be OK.""

Pedroza attends an appointment with her licensed midwives Susan Taylor who checks her stomach, and Amanda Prouty in Taylor's home office at her house. As COVID-19 puts the globe on pause and changes every aspect of daily life, women are entering motherhood with a mixture of anxiety, fear and frustration. Some countries, although not the United States, have banned everyone from the delivery room. Others are separating women who become sick from their newborns. By early April, with her baby past due and learning Medicaid would not cover a home birth, Pedroza considered giving birth at home without any medical assistance.

Pedroza experiences contractions. She got in touch with midwife Susan Taylor on Facebook, who not only lowered her fee but offered up her own home when Pedroza's mother became uneasy about the idea of her grandchild being born in her bathroom or bedroom. But Pedroza was running out of time. Legally the midwife had to transfer Pedroza's care to a hospital if she went past 42 weeks of pregnancy. A sonogram showed the baby's fluid levels were low, which can cause complications during birth.

Pedroza is supported by Jones and Morgan as she experiences contractions while laboring. After a membrane sweep, visit to a chiropractor, a brisk walk and using a breast pump to stimulate labor, the contractions started. After laboring several hours in a birthing tub in Taylor's home, Pedroza started pushing but the baby's heart rate suddenly dropped from 130 to 30, so the midwives called an ambulance.

Pedroza experiences contractions as she is placed onto an ambulance stretcher to be taken to hospital by paramedics. Masked emergency workers put Pedroza onto a stretcher and wheeled her to an ambulance that took her and Morgan to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest around 1 a.m. Taylor rode with her in the ambulance, monitoring the baby's heartbeat.

Pedroza is carried into an ambulance on a stretcher, to be taken to hospital. But once at the hospital, her midwives had to leave. ""Once I got the epidural administered and calmed me down a little bit and realizing I'd still be able to do this myself without possibly having a C-section and hearing the baby's heartbeat on the monitor it brought me so much comfort that I didn't care I was at the hospital at that point,"" said Pedroza, who worked as a massage therapist before becoming pregnant.

Prouty watches 2-day old footage of the birth of Kai Rohan Morgan, recorded by his father Ryan, of Pedroza giving birth. After laboring with a mask on for hours, at 5:55 a.m. on April 8 a healthy baby boy named Kai Rohan Morgan was born, weighing 8 pounds and 5 ounces. The hospital gave her and Morgan masks to wear anytime someone entered their room. Some staff also wore masks and gloves when they helped with breast feeding and took their vital signs.

Taylor takes two-day old Kai's temperature while checking if he has tongue tie, an oral condition that can potentially cause issues with feeding, during a newborn screening at the house of Kai's maternal grandparents.

Story ""It's already kind of scary thinking that it's a possibility that you're going to be in an environment that is contaminated or that puts you at risk or your baby at risk,"" Pedroza said. ""What puts me on edge more is seeing everyone with that attire and being very adamant about wearing it.""",real
1075,1040,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jc-penney-bankruptcy-protection-coronavirus-retail/,2020-05-15,J.C. Penney files for bankruptcy protection,"J.C. Penney, one of America's most recognizable clothing stores, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Friday. In doing so, the 118-year-old store became the latest major retailer to succumb to a sales slump during the coronavirus pandemic.

J.C. Penney was one of many brick-and-mortar stores forced to temporarily close its locations as the pandemic spread across the U.S. The closures put J.C. Penney a step closer to bankruptcy, the company said Friday.

CEO Jill Soltau said in a statement Friday that J.C. Penney's leadership made significant progress toward rebuilding the company, but ""the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.""

J.C. Penney officials said its physical and online stores will remain open during the bankruptcy restructuring. The company has already begun reopening some locations, including in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The Plano-based clothing store filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Southern District of Texas.

Although the pandemic further dented J.C. Penney, the store has been declining for years amid the growth in e-commerce, and is weighed down by $4 billion in debt. It has closed numerous stores in recent years to cut costs.

J.C. Penney has $500 million in cash and has commitments from lenders for another $900 million to help the company get through its structuring, company officials said. J.C. Penney plans to close more stores as part of the bankruptcy, but company officials didn't specify which ones or how many.

Soltau said bankruptcy ""is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come.""

J.C. Penney, which has roughly 85,000 employees, has now joined Neiman Marcus and J. Crew among the retailers to go bankrupt since the virus struck. In its most recent quarter J.C. Penney's sales fell nearly 8%, to $3.4 billion, from the year-ago period, while income was $27 million, down from $75 million a year ago. J.C. Penney missed two debt payments in April and May, which many analysts saw as a harbinger of bankruptcy.

""J.C. Penney actually embraced e-commerce earlier than most other U.S. department store chains, but the company did not capitalize on this head start,"" Bob Hoyler, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International, said in a statement to CBS News. ""J.C. Penney has not been able to survive on its e-commerce sales alone during the pandemic, so the forced store closures represent months of revenue that will simply never be recouped.""

The company's bankruptcy comes days after J.C. Penney gave its top executives millions of dollars in bonus pay. CEO Jill Soltau received $4.5 million, while chief financial officer Bill Wafford, chief merchant officer Michelle Wlazlo and chief human resources officer Brynn Evanson each got $1 million, the company disclosed in a May 10 regulatory filing.

Large companies give so-called retention bonuses to top executives to encourage corporate leaders to remain on board as the company restructures and, if possible, exit court supervision as stronger competitors.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his senior adviser Dominic Cummings, who reportedly ignored COVID-19 lockdown rules while travelling with his wife who had coronavirus symptoms.

""I think that what they did was totally understandable. I think any father, any parent would frankly understand what he did and I certainly do"", Johnson said at a news conference on Sunday.

The UK prime minister also stated that he had held ""extensive"" conversations with Cummings and concluded that he acted ""responsibly, legally and with integrity"".

According to the Daily Mirror, Cummings has been reported to the Durham Police for breaking the COVID-19 lockdown rules.

Cummings stated earlier that he had travelled to Durham to be near extended family because his wife was showing COVID-19 symptoms. He reportedly thought that he was also infected and wanted to ensure that his four-year-old son was looked after.

According to The Guardian, Cummings was spotted in Durham on 19 April, and at Barnard Castle, which is located 30 miles from Durham, on Easter Day. The Guardian reported on 23 May that UK ministers had insisted that Cummings stayed put once arriving at the property in Durham, where he was seeking support from his extended family as he had demonstrated coronavirus symptoms, along with his wife.

In response to the British media reports, a Downing Street spokeswoman said that the stories, particularly from the Mirror and The Guardian, were inaccurate.

""We will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr Cummings from campaigning newspapers"", the spokeswoman said in a statement on Saturday.

Following the reports about Cummings, calls for his resignation have gained momentum. Cummings was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign and took part in the development of the British government’s coronavirus strategy.",fake
1081,444,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/26/21237435/live-nation-automatically-issuing-ticket-refunds-canceled-shows-covid-19-coronavirus,2020-04-26,Live Nation automatically issuing refunds for shows canceled due to COVID-19,"It’s official: Live Nation customers will now automatically receive a refund if the concert or show they bought tickets for is canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The event promoter, which announced the “Ticket Relief” initiative last week, posted the update on its website and social media accounts Friday.

The policy goes into effect May 1, when Live Nation begins sending out notification emails updating customers on the the status of thousands of shows affected by stay-at-home orders and bans on large gatherings issued over the last two months.

“If 60 days has passed since a show was postponed and no rescheduled dates have been announced, the 30-day window for refunds will open at that time,” Live Nation added on its “Ticket Relief” page.

In the case of rescheduled shows at venues operated by Live Nation, customers will have 30 days to request a refund or apply it as 150% credit towards future events once the new date is announced. (The offer is not valid for special events, third party rentals or festivals.)

“When you choose this option, Live Nation will also donate tickets to healthcare workers to share the gift of live with those working on the front line through our Hero Nation program,” the company said. “We will donate one ticket for every ticket you originally purchased.

For customers who don’t request a refund within that window, their existing tickets will automatically be valid for the new date. Alternately, customers can opt to donate their tickets for the rescheduled show to front-line workers.

COVID-19 concerns could create a $9 billion loss for the concert industry, The LA Times reported earlier this month.

Cancellations and postponements have been piling up as the pandemic has played out. The latest example: pop megastar Taylor Swift, who announced last week that she was calling off her “Lover Fest” stadium tour and other live appearances for the rest of 2020. Her U.S. dates will be rescheduled for next year. Those unable to attend rescheduled U.S. dates can seek a refund “subject to Ticketmaster terms” beginning May 1.

In addition, Madonna has canceled show dates and Pearl Jam and The Zac Brown Band have postponed entire tours.

In the case of postponed arena and stadium shows, event promoters likely won’t have a clear picture of when they can reschedule concerts until the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball decide how and when to restart their seasons and resume their game schedules for those venues. The NBA got that process rolling Saturday, when it announced that teams can reopen practice facilities in cities where stay-at-home orders have been eased.

The church accounts for more than half of the nearly 4,000 coronavirus cases in the region. Critics accuse the church of being a cult and obstructing efforts to fight the outbreak.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

A megachurch in South Korea is at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in that country. There are more than 4,000 cases in South Korea, and more than half of those are members of the church. The church's critics accuse its leaders of obstructing official efforts to fight this outbreak. As NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul, the group's founder is now apologizing.

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: At a training facility of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus outside Seoul, the group's founder, 84-year-old Lee Man-hee, addressed a crowd of journalists on Monday afternoon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE MAN-HEE: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""People of South Korea, how can I apologize to you?"" He said in a quavering voice. ""I feel utterly ashamed. I bow down before you to ask your forgiveness."" He knelt his forehead, nearly touching the ground. Protesters shouted at him in the background.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE M: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""This is not about any individual. This is a huge disaster,"" he added. ""We're doing everything we can to stop it. Now is not the time to judge who's wrong and who's right."" The Seoul city government filed criminal charges against Lee on Sunday, saying his failure to turn over complete lists of church members amounts to homicide. He insists he's fully cooperating with authorities. The group admits that some of its members travelled from China to South Korea at the end of last year, possibly bringing the virus with them. Health authorities are testing around 200,000 of the church's members for infections, including Lee Man-hee himself.

Lee Jung-eun, a Ph.D. candidate at Seoul National University's religious studies department, says that before the epidemic, the church was growing robustly.

LEE JUNG-EUN: (Through interpreter) Shincheonji is the most prominent of the homegrown new religious movements. It's also the youngest and the most energetic. It's said that a third of its followers are from younger generations.

KUHN: In recent years, the church has filled vast arenas with his followers, such as this 2018 event in Seoul. Musicians wore tuxedos and traditional hanbok gowns. After the music, Lee Man-hee delivered a sermon punctuated by roars of approval from the crowd. Critics say the packed rows of believers and hearty amens are perfect for spreading viruses. Since the outbreak within its membership became known, the church has shut down all of its 1,100 churches and facilities nationwide. At a sermon in Daegu city last year, Lee foretold the coming of a new heaven and earth, or Shincheonji in Korean.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LEE M: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""Six thousand years of God's history ends here in this world, in this time,"" he says. ""Even the archenemy, Satan, will be captured and jailed. That's what the book of Revelation says. Then comes the Kingdom of God, the one that lives forever."" Religious scholar Lee Jung-eun says this is how Shincheonji attracts followers - by promising them eternal life, not after they die but in their current bodies.

LEE J: (Through interpreter) Lee Man-hee is supposed to be immortal. Shincheonji believers think that he will not die, nor will they, if they make it into a group of 144,000 believers whom he has promised eternal life.

KUHN: She says Shincheonji and other groups like it have thrived under South Korea's laissez-faire religious policies.

LEE J: (Through interpreter) Religions are seen to have their own space and their own logic separate from the rest of society. This view has contributed to the emergence and growth of various sects and a sort of neoliberal free market of religion.

KUHN: But the government is under pressure to act against the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. More than a million people have signed a petition on the presidential office's website calling for the government to disband the group.

1093,689,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/mount-sinai-sorrento-covid-19-venture/,2020-05-08,Mount Sinai-Sorrento COVID-19 Venture,"Collaborations are being formed across the board to develop testing, vaccines and drugs to utilize against SARS-CoV-2 which has raised concerns about the potential of the product being developed, especially the ones that have had rushed expeditions.

Many are beginning to worry that the COVID-19 virus will, like many others, mutate or develop a way to get around the antibodies that are under development that target the virus’s spike protein which facilitates the infection of healthy cells.

To address this concern Sorrento Therapeutics is working on developing an antibody cocktail that will bind to three different epitopes rather than targeting just one point on the spike protein as most of the current work elsewhere is doing. The company has also teamed up with Mount Sinai Health System in New York to help further the development of the cocktail treatment.

“If one epitope mutates and one of the antibodies does not do its job anymore, the other two can do the job,” Henry Ji, Ph.D., CEO of Sorrento, told FierceBiotechResearch. “They are synergistic.”

According to Ji, the cocktail therapy is being called COVI-SHIELD, and it started with a diagnostic developed at Sinai which was used to screen 15,000 people believed to have recovered from the disease. Samples from these patients are being used to identify a few dozen antibodies that stand the best odds of being able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

Sorrento will also be working with scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch who will then be testing the antibodies against the live virus to investigate how to achieve total inhibition of viral infection. Once the top performers are identified the company will present the selections to Sinai to further analyze the selections. Once the company moves into phase 1 trials that are hoped to begin in the third quarter, Sinai may also serve as the clinical testing site for COVI-SHIELD.

Sorrento has entered the field to join the companies working to develop antibodies to neutralize COVID-19 along with others such as Eli Lilly who recently paid $10 million to Junshi Biosciences for the right to co-develop and market a human monoclonal antibody against the disease. However, Regeneron has identified two neutralizing antibodies and is considered to be the front runner in the race with plans to move their cocktail to testing as early as June 2020.

Neutralizing antibodies does not come without risks of the possibility of backfiring in the antibody dependent enhancement process, whereby the virus can use the antibodies to bolster the infection. Regeneron suggests to have addressed this concern expressing confidence that their experimental cocktail can avoid ADE by targeting “uber stealth constant regions” of the virus.

Antibodies are being engineered by Sorrento to not bind to the receptor on immune cells that are believed to cause ADE; antibodies will also be selected that have different mechanisms for neutralizing the virus to reduce the chance of patients becoming resistant to treatment, according to Robert Allen who is the vice president of antiviral and oncolytic immunotherapy development for Sorrento.

“Some of them are going to neutralize through direct blocking between spike and ACE2,” the receptor that helps the virus infect human cells, Allen said. “Others are going to neutralize through a non-blocking mechanism. We’re able to create a higher barrier to resistance that way.”

The company is setting out on this venture after avoiding a takeover bid from an equity firm in January 2020, disclosing it received a buyout bid of $7 a share which was twice the trading price at the time.

Despite the increasing amount of competition rushing to develop and market against COVID-19, Sorrento and its academic collaborators are confident they will be able to work quickly to discover an effective cocktail to utilize against the disease. The company is aware of all the rivals and says there is still much work to do before any treatment will be ready for clinical testing.

“The Mount Sinai collaboration is very important for us, because they screened 15,000 samples and picked the highest-protected people,” Ji said. “We expect to be able to isolate very potent antibodies. We don’t know which of these antibodies will be useful. Maybe some of them, maybe none,” he said. “Whoever has the best antibody wins.”",fake

Now, the team has teamed up with the nearby Mayo Clinic, a non-profit medical research center, in Rochester, Minnesota to fight the disease. According to ESPN, the clinic will conduct a leaguewide study to determine the percentage of coaches, players, executives and staff who have developed antibodies to the coronavirus.

Stanford University and Major League Baseball partnered to conduct a similar study — which showed that 0.7% of the approximately 10,000 individuals tested had the antibodies — a month ago.

All 30 teams are expected to participate in the study, with the support of both front offices and the players' union, ESPN reported.

1107,1117,https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/05/15/study-cautions-against-use-of-cloth-masks-because-they-can-increase-your-risk-of-infection/,2020-05-15,Study Finds That Cloth Masks Can Increase Healthcare Workers Risk of Infection,"In Brief The Facts: A study published in 2015 found that cloth masks can increase healthcare workers risk of infection. It also called into question the efficacy of medical masks.

Reflect On: If masks may not protect healthcare workers in an acute setting, what are they doing for the public? Are the decisions made by health regulatory agencies always in the best interest of the public?

A lot of places are mandating that people wear a mask. Some grocery stores here in Canada are making it mandatory for people who want to do some shopping, and Los Angeles County recently mandated that all people must wear a mask when going outside. But do these measures really help? We are living in strange times when people like Bill Gates are getting a lot of T.V. time, as he seems to be the world’s leading ‘health’ authority on the new coronavirus, what we should do, and how we’re going to stop it. On the other hand, there are several doctors and leading epidemiologists around the world who have been studying viruses for decades that have been censored from social media platforms for sharing their research and opinions. Their interviews are being taken down, and some have even been flagged as ‘fake.’ Ask yourself, what’s wrong with this picture? Many of them are suggesting that the new coronavirus is not nearly as dangerous as it’s being made out to be. There have been multiple studies that have also suggested this based on the data that researchers have accumulated. Mainstream media is trying really hard to shape our perception with regards to everything that surrounds the new coronavirus, from treatment, lockdowns, to social distancing and much more.

We’ve covered a few examples of these experts giving their opinions with regards to how dangerous this virus actually is, what the solution is, treatments and more. If you’re interested you can refer to the articles linked at the bottom of this one. At the end of the day, a lot of what these doctors, scientists and epidemiologists have been saying since the beginning of this outbreak, up until now, has completely contradicted the narrative of federal health regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, social media and other platforms are banning content that opposes and contradicts the WHO, no matter how much evidence is behind the information, or even if the sources are some of the leading experts in the world.

Should there be a digital authoritarian Orwellian ‘fact checker’ going around the internet telling people what is, and what isn’t? Or should people have the right to examine information, check sources and evidence and ultimately decide for themselves?

Special note to our followers: Is 5G safe? Learn the unbiased truth and the steps to implement better solutions in your community at the 5G Health Summit. It’s a free worldwide call to action from the leading independent experts, scientists and doctors in the field. You can sign up here.

So the question is, can we really trust these health authorities to guide us into doing what’s really best for us? Is this really about our health or is something else going on here? Are there powerful people profiting off of this both politically and financially? Was Edward Snowden correct when he said that the new coronavirus fiasco is no different from 9/11, in that it’s simply being used to push more authoritarian measures on the population? Just like they remained after 9/11, will they remain after this coronavirus? Why are there apps tracking people for coronavirus, but not for the pedophiles, murderers and rapists? These are important things to think about.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there and again, if you’re interested in going a little deeper you can refer to the articles listed at the end of this one.

But what about masks? Do they really help? How effective are they? According to Dr. Dan Erickson (former emergency-room physician) and Dr. Artin Massihi (emergency medicine specialist affiliated with multiple hospitals) of Accelerated Urgent Care in California, they’re not helping at all.

When you wear gloves that transfer disease everywhere, those gloves have bacteria all over them. “I’m wearing gloves,” not helping you…Your mask that you’re wearing for days, you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth, this doesn’t make any sense. We wear masks in an acute setting to protect us, we’re not wearing masks (right now). Why is that? Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems. I don’t want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system, and then come out and get disease. We’ve both been to the ER through swine flu and through bird flu, did we shut down for those? Were they much less dangerous than COVID? Is the flu less dangerous than COVID? Let’s look at the death rates, no it’s not. They’re similar in prevalence and in death rate. (source)

According to a study published in BMJ Open in 2015,

This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.

According to the study, it was unclear if they help at all, and that they probably need to be worn at all times in acute/dangerous settings within the hospital to be effective at all.

There are also other potential health consequences of wearing not just a cloth mask, but also medical masks. The physiological effects of breathing elevated inhaled CO 2 may include changes in visual performance, modified exercise endurance, headaches and dyspnea. The psychological effects include decreased reasoning and alertness, increased irritability, severe dyspnea, headache, dizziness, perspiration, and short-term memory loss. (source)

This study suggests that masks don’t really help, and depending on the material, they can actually make things worse. That being said, there are studies suggesting that medical masks are indeed effective, but the studies are referring to health care workers in acute settings, not the general public.

Below is a quote from a very interesting paper published in 2016, titled “The Surgical Mask Is A Bad Fit For Risk Reduction.”

As represented by our cinema and other media, Western society expects too much of masks. In the public’s mind, the still-legitimate use of masks for source control has gone off-label; masks are thought to prevent infection. From here, another problem arises: because surgical masks are thought to protect against infection in the community setting, people wearing masks for legitimate purposes (those who have a cough in a hospital, say) form part of the larger misperception and act to reinforce it. Even this proper use of surgical masks is incorporated into a larger improper use in the era of pandemic fear, especially in Asia, where such fear is high. The widespread misconception about the use of surgical masks — that wearing a mask protects against the transmission of virus — is a problem of the kind theorized by German sociologist Ulrich Beck. The birth of the mask came from the realization that surgical wounds need protection from the droplets released in the breath of surgeons. The technology was applied outside the operating room in an effort to control the spread of infectious epidemics. In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve. At the time, it was unknown that the influenza organism is nanoscopic and can theoretically penetrate the surgical mask barrier. As recently as 2010, the US National Academy of Sciences declared that, in the community setting, “face masks are not designed or certified to protect the wearer from exposure to respiratory hazards.” A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus…

The Microsoft co-founder, meanwhile, has contributed millions of dollars to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and testing, as part of global efforts to fight the virus.

More than 40% of self-described Republicans and Fox News viewers believe in a conspiracy theory that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates plans to use a future COVID-19 vaccine in order to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements, a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll has revealed.

Some 26% of respondents, however, rejected the theory as false, and 31% more said that they were not sure.

They were echoed by 45% of independents, 52% of Democrats, and 63% of people who say they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, stating that they don't believe in the vaccine conspiracy theory, especially Gates’ alleged involvement in it, according to the poll.

The survey also found that only half of Americans are ready to get vaccinated “if and when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available”. Twenty-three percent of respondents said that they would not do so, with 27% admitting that they were still sitting on the fence.

The poll comes after a bizarre rant by Italian lawmaker and vocal anti-vax activist Sara Cunial who last week hit out at Gates as she urged fellow MPs to defy any plans for compulsory vaccination against the coronavirus.

In an apparent reference to the billionaire pumping hefty sums into the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Cunial asserted that “the real goal of all of this is total control” and “absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty, and free will"".

She went even further by saying that “next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity”.

The controversial claims followed the Microsoft co-founder saying in an interview with CNBC in April about “a huge challenge” pertaining to “the efficacy of vaccines in older people”.

“Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range, because they're most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. You know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know, way more - 700,000, you know, people - who will suffer from that”, Gates added.

The interview was preceded by the billionaire injecting hundreds of millions of dollars, including $100 million through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, into the coronavirus vaccine and testing, as part of international efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a separate interview with CNN, Gates described current US coronavirus testing data as ""bogus"" because of its inaccuracy and slow turnaround, adding that Washington “does not prioritise who gets tested and […] does not make sure you get results in 24 hours”.

President Donald Trump, for his part, pledged that there would be a vaccine against the coronavirus in the US by the end of 2020, adding that the country will have it “much sooner rather than later"".",fake

For this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked teenagers to tell us about acts of kindness they have observed since the onset of the coronavirus. We also wanted to know how their internet habits have changed and where they would like to be stranded during the pandemic.
We’d like to give a warm welcome to the new students who joined the conversation this week from: Aurora, Ill.; Bethesda, Md.; Cambria School of Excellence; Camdenton, Mo.; Carbondale, Colo.; Desplaine, Ill.; El Paso, Tex.; Ella T. Grasso Southeastern Technical High School, Conn.; Eugene, Ore.; Gladeville Middle School; Healy, Alaska; Hopkinton, N.H.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Lake of the Ozarks, Mo.; Larchmont, N.Y.; Lovettsville, Va.; Marblehead, Mass.; Marlborough, Mass.; Middleton, Mass.; Springfield, Ore.; Stratford, Conn.; Utah and Valencia High School.
Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.
_________What Acts of Kindness Have You Heard About or Participated In During Coronavirus?
While the current crisis has brought lots of stress, grief and uncertainty into our lives, it has also led to acts of kindness, generosity and solidarity.
We asked students what acts of selflessness they have witnessed. They told us about the ways, big and small, they and other have been making an impact in their communities.
Making masksOne act of kindness that I’ve been participating in is making masks with my mom and selling them to people for very low prices. We go to stores and buy certain fabrics and materials either with designs or no designs and make them into beautiful masks. Recently we’ve been selling them to workers and they have said some very nice comments towards the masks and our dedication to helping people. Another thing I do is deliver the masks to people around our neighborhood that can’t go outside so I just suit up put on my mask and gloves and head out and I can say that this has brought much joy to me especially when I know that I’m using my time well and not sitting around playing video games all day.— jose Martinez, Desplaine Illinois
I’ve heard of many people sewing masks out of their materials and decontaminating them. They then can safely distribute them to people in their community to use less surgical masks that are in high demand and needed in hospitals. I think this is useful because it can also encourage people who may be sick to wear masks while they are out while simultaneously saving resources that are needed by health care workers. It’s something people can do in the safety of their homes to help their community.— Kathleen S., J.R. Masterman
Cooking for othersMy mom works for the hospital and I have been volunteering to help with “Meals for Heroes” that is sponsored by the Greater Wilmington Business Journal and New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Different businesses are providing 100 meals per day, to the front line workers at the hospital. I have been helping hand out the meals to the hospital staff as they drive down “Gratitude Lane.”— Daniel Guy, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, my mom and I have cooked numerous dishes for older people we know. We made lasagna, cake, soup, various treats, vegetable plates, and more. We do so to promote them to quarantine and eliminate any reason for them to leave the house. My mom also buys groceries for her parents and older friends. I try to lighten up my grandparents by calling them. I do other types of community service within my girl scout troop, including fundraisers, making blankets and for animals in shelters, and caroling to elders. On our own, my mom and I hand out water and granola bars to homeless people. The quote “it’s better to give than to receive” does have some truth. If you are in a place to give, then give, so someone in need gets help.— Isadora Monteith, J.R. Masterman
Donation effortsAs the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live). We donated snacks, drinks, shampoo, soap and handmade cards. I am also growing my hair so I can donate it to make wigs for children with cancer. During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.— Allison Go, South Korea
Recently, my sister and I realized that our bookcases were full of books we had not read in years, either because we had already read them, or because they were children’s books. With all the free time we had over the weekend, we decided to sort through our books and decide which ones to donate. We each ended up with huge piles of books, and we organized them into categories. At this point, we could have donated all of the books to some organization. However, we wanted to know exactly where our books were going so we could feel the effect of the deed more. My mom posted pictures of all of our books on the “Moms of New Rochelle” Facebook group with the caption “free books.” She instantly began receiving messages from mothers who said their children were running out of books to read since the libraries are now closed. We messaged back and forth with some of the mothers, suggesting books for their children based on their ages and interests. Every mother expressed gratitude; one even asked how she could repay us, telling us she could send us gloves if we wanted. We refused, partly because we did not need gloves, but also partly because the good feeling we got from doing the deed was sufficient pay.— Daviel Schulman, New Rochelle, NY
VolunteeringDuring the coronavirus epidemic my church has supported homeless people by giving them food and items like a mask, hand sanitizer, and blankets to stay safe. Homeless people right now need as much help as possible to stay healthy during the pandemic. They don’t have the money or the resources to stay afloat. I believe with everything that my church does can help them.— Izel, J.R. Masterman
Since I can remember, my family’s value system has been based on volunteering and helping others. I don’t remember a season where my temple congregation was running an annual charity drive that my family did not help execute. Throughout my life I have renovated parks, run food donation trips, and organized clothing drives. Not only were these roles expected of me, it felt natural to spend my time giving to others. During the high holidays, I had the opportunity to donate over 500 bags of food to our local food kitchen with my youth group. Giving to others helped me realize that life was much bigger than what was right in front of me. The action of providing help, health and happiness to others filled me with a joy I had never experienced. I am lucky enough to be able to give onto others and it is one of the most valuable gifts one can achieve. — Hayden Roberge, New Rochelle, NY
One of my friends has an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Many kids do a mitzvah protect for their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. A mitzvah project is a project that helps other people. My friend chose to do his at the Jewish Relief Agency (JRA). At the JRA, once a month, people come to a warehouse and help pack boxes with food. Then people deliver the boxes to people who need the food. I often went to help him pack and deliver boxes with him. I think that the act was incredibly beneficial to me because It helped me realize how many people need help in this world. This experience was also really fun. That made me realize that helping others can be as exciting for you as it is for the person you are helping sometimes— Jonah Smith Posner, J.R. Masterman
Small, but meaningful, gestures I haven’t really been able to do too many things for people other than texting and calling people to let them know I’ve been thinking of them. I have been trying to make an effort to talk to people I don’t normally talk with, just offering a fun conversation to distract from the world. An act I have experienced is people I don’t normally talk to reaching out to talk to me, and that meant a lot, and that is what inspired me to start doing the same.— Jamie, Healy, AK
Sometime last week, my friends and their parents got together and invited our neighborhood to put up lights on each of their houses. My family put up a sign in one of our windows that reads “HOPE” in colorful light, and I’ve seen other houses use this invitation very creatively. Throughout this pandemic, there can still be ways to illuminate the world with our goodness, even if it’s from a distance.— Kaycia B., NUAMES High School, Layton UT
I heard about people thanking garbage collectors for their work during such difficult time. A few words can go a long way, and many of these kind verbal acts have had positive impacts on these people. Even if you don’t have money to donate, it’s completely free to thank someone for the difficult work they’re doing in such times. Those people are putting their lives at risk for us, so it’s the least we can do.— Saharsh Satheesh, Collierville High School, Tennessee
In a dire time like this, keeping in touch and helping others really matters. This pandemic really pushes us to aid the ones we love to keep them safe, and talk to the people we truly care about to not loose communication in this month of isolation. My family has been sending food and puzzles to my grandparents to keep them busy and so they don’t have to go to the store as it can be dangerous for them especially. Acts of kindness towards others are very meaningful now more than ever.— Autumn Klein, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL
I’ve been hearing from my grandma that people in her community are dropping groceries at her door so she doesn’t have to go to the supermarket. These acts of kindness, which I hear are happening throughout her town, give me hope that communities will come together in these trying times. I am grateful to anyone helping the elderly right now, as they are especially vulnerable to the virus, and really cannot afford to leave their homes even for groceries.— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
_________How Has the Coronavirus Changed How You Use the Internet?
As the coronavirus rages, homebound students are spending increasingly more time online and so we asked students about how their internet habits have changed.
Reflecting on their hyper-digital lives, many students were dismayed by the quantity and quality of their screen time and its impact on their physical, mental and emotional health. Some, however, have seized the opportunity to forge new intellectual, civic and social connections, trying to thrive amid an ongoing crisis.
Spending much more time on the internetThe internet has turned from something that I used for entertainment and to help complete schoolwork into what my life revolves around. If I have to do school work, it’s through the internet. If I want to stay in touch with my friends, it’s through the internet. If I want to access anything outside of my home, it’s through the internet. Consequently, the time I’m spending on the internet has grown significantly since the start of quarantine. This has been frustrating because of the lack of face-to-face interaction with anyone aside from my family and exercising becoming more difficult, but it has also opened up new methods in which I can connect with my friends. Because my best friend and I can no longer see one another in person, we’ve begun playing more video games together and have been bonding that way. One of our other friends had their birthday during quarantine and we had a Zoom call to celebrate which we would have never done before. — Sam McNamara, John T. Hoggard High (Wilmington, NC)
Since my school closed originally on March 13th for two weeks, now the rest of the school year, I have been using my phone a lot more than I would in normal circumstances. I used to use my phone 2-3 hours a day but know, my daily average is around 10-12 hours, even up to 15 hours a day. I have been trying to cut down on my daily screen time but it is really hard because I have nothing else to fill my days except for it. Some of my friends are still saying they have been able to keep there screen time down to 5 hours a day and I am like how is that possible? Hopefully, I’ll be able to lower my screen time once online school starts up.—Ryan Altschuler, J.R Masterman School
Binge watchingMy screentime has grown to 8 hours per day which is 6 hours more than it used to before school closed. I am using the Internet more than I ever have. I spend most of that time on Netflix where I have been binging TV shows like Money Heist, Ozark, and Tiger King. I would usually watch the Sixers game every time they play but now there are only live streams NBA stars playing H.O.R.S.E. — Leonard Vekker, J.R. Masterman PA
The Coronavirus has greatly impacted how much time I spend on the internet. My computer is my main source for schoolwork and entertainment. On my computer, I complete all my assignments and watch movies. My most time engaging app is Netflix. I have started binge watching all my favorite shows during all this free time. I read in an article that due to everyone staying home, Netflix’s memberships have doubled. One con towards all this screen time is that it causes many headaches. I spend every day staring at my screen that my head starts to hurt. This is where I take some time to go outside and enjoy the nice weather.— Yahaira H, Cass High School, Georgia
Going to school onlineThe coronavirus has definitely changed the way I use the internet. It has effected me the most in school. I spend about 2-4 hours a day doing online work or video conferences. In some ways online school is better. For example my math teacher post videos of her doing the lesson. Now I am able to go at my own pace, I can pause if I need or re watch something I didn’t understand.
On the other hand I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I’ve been assigned. It is far more stressful than doing the work at school. It is also difficult because there is lack in communication. I don’t always understand what I’m supposed to do for some assignments. I’ve also had problems with online conferences. I’ve had teachers that accidentally say the wrong time to meet, or not being able to reach some students.— Tiana, Utah
With the recent spread of the pandemic, I find that online school has impacted me the most. Not only I can’t see my friends from school, online school is also way more stressful that normal school. It can be hard to do school when there are so many distractions like YouTube and looking on social media. Or even not feeling motivated to do online school. But the worst part it just trying to find and do the assignments and getting good grades.— Morgan, Eugene OR
I realized that my habits have changed. I use my phone as soon as I wake up to check Google Classroom notifications, not Instagram. The whole situation is ironic because in school, I had the temptation to scroll through Instagram, yet when home, I find myself motivated to achieve the satisfaction of finishing assignments and clicking that submit button. The time I used to spend checking snapchat stories is now time I use to listen to podcasts on Spotify. I find myself naturally distancing from the one object I was addicted to three months ago.— Akshara Koottala, New Rochelle High School, NY
Trying something newBefore coronavirus, I had begun to start relying on my phone less often than usual. My screen time went from five to three hours, and I finally realized that I did not need my phone as much as I thought I did. However, once we were out of school and sports were cancelled, I was on my phone for up to eight or nine hours a day, which is crazy! …
On the bright side, I have started using Twitter more (for news and entertainment purposes), and I am striving to become stronger in financial literacy and the stock market, since it is such a crazy time right now on Wall Street. One of my father’s friends began day trading to pass the time, so it is interesting to hear from him about how his stocks and his money are standing, even with the market as bad as it is.— Carter Osborn, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
The CoronaVirus has hardly affected my internet usage at all. My screen time has barely gone up at all. I used to average around 15-16 hours on my phone each day, and now I average just about 16 hours. However now I do diversify what I do on my electronics. To pass the time I have been using my electronics to do things like mastering a skill and trying new games— Nathanael Kassahun, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA
Building relationshipsI find that I get anxious when I spend more time of social media platforms. This being said, now that many of my relationships are based off of screen interaction, I have had to remind myself to spend more time on the phone with friends as opposed to messaging them. Calling someone or FaceTiming them leaves me happier and less anxious then when I type our conversations. I’ve started to call a person per day while social distancing … and it has really helped improve my mental health. I highly recommend!— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
My friends and I also try to talk and video chat more often, also allowing me to have a form of social interaction through the internet. I find myself video chatting with family members more consistently rather than talking to them on the phone every few weeks. This allows me to see them virtually, and even though they live thousands of miles away, this allows me to feel closer to them.
While the coronavirus has provided a grand number of changes, the internet has allowed me to keep some consistency and routines in these tough times. Without the online access that we have, I cannot imagine how the world would be able to handle the pandemic since so much of our lives revolve around being connected online.— Nora Shefferman, New Rochelle High School, NY
MourningMy experience has been 50/50 because 2 of my family members died due to the virus and my brother and law had survived the virus and spent two weeks in the hospital. The graph does match my experience because my family is sad of our family members that died and they were important to our lives. There are many videos of nurses crying and how the death rates have grown in New York in the past 2 months and nurses quitting there job to support there families— Arturo Salas, Queens
_________Where Would You Like to Be Stranded?
A couple from South Africa found themselves stranded on their honeymoon in the Maldives after their country closed its borders to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Inspired by their story, we asked students were they would like to be during the pandemic in our Picture Prompt, “Stuck in Paradise.” From beaches to their homes to Target, here’s what they had to say:A tropical getawayIf I was stranded, I would want to be on a beach that has all of the supplies I need to survive. Such as fruits, wood, and things to build a fire. I would probably take one or two of my friends just to try the experiment. I would also bring snorkel stuff and maybe try to borrow a surfboard so I can have fun. I might also bring my dog. I don’t want to have to worry about COVID-19. I would want to get away so that I can get rid of all the anxiety and stress. I might also bring my dog.— Hen, Des Moines, Iowa
If I could be stuck somewhere in the world during this pandemic it would definitely be the Bahamas. The Bahamas is such a beautiful place to spend time and the water is so clear. I would be spending most of my time at the beach or a nice beach house. I would certainly miss my family but if I had the choice, they would be there with me. The Bahamas would definitely take my mind off of the horrible things happening recently with the virus. I could just stay there and relax without having to think about anything.— Kaitlyn Frances, New York
With loved onesMy sister was studying abroad in Paris this year. When Trump closed all travel from Europe, my family was freaking out. They weren’t sure if that meant my sister wouldn’t be able to fly home. That night, my mom waited on hold with Air France for 3 hours in order to get my sister on the soonest flight home to Chicago. Although I was excited that my sister was coming home, at first I was confused why everyone was freaking out so much. I personally would much rather be trapped in Paris, than in the snow here in Chicago. After careful consideration, I realized why it was so important for her to come home. The most essential thing right now is that families stick together. If my sister was still in Paris, my parents would never stop stressing out.
So in the end, I would like to be quarantined with my loved ones. (If I really had a choice, I wouldn’t mind doing my e learning by the pool) But for now, I wouldn’t care where I was, as long as my family was all together.— Ellie Short, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
I don’t know if stranded would be the right vernacular but if I could be quarantined in any place during this pandemic I would want to go to Korea. I am Korean by my parents and while my immediate family is here in Southern California, my entire extended family is in Korea. Having been to my home country multiple times in the past I know how amazing and different the life there is. But especially during my only-child life-at-home experience, I realized that I want nothing more than to be with my family and my people. — Brenda Kim, Valencia High School
If I were to be quarantined anywhere, I would probably choose Cuba. I have lots of family there who I never get to see, and staying with them for an extended period of time is a luxury for me and my family. Not only would I get to spend time with the people I love, I would get to enjoy the weather and explore the island with my cousins and brother.— Lucia T, Brooklyn, NY
I would want to be stuck in the band room of my school, that is where I have had the best memories, and would be around my favorite people, its truly my home away from home and would do anything to be there right now.— Abigail, Pennsylvania
Somewhere funIf I had to be quarantined anywhere it would definitely be a mountain house in the Lake Tahoe area. I would want to be quarantined here because while the main ski resorts are close you can never really close the backcountry. And while It would definitely be a challenge I think it would be a ton of fun.— Isaac, Brooklyn Ny
I would want to be stranded in Alabama where I could be playing with baby fainting goats, relaxing, being in the heat, eating barbecue, drinking sweet tea and working in the gardens. I would be riding a tractor and swimming.— Kate Schwartzman, NYC
I would honestly like to be stranded in Traverse City, Michigan during the summertime. The weather is absolutely amazing in that time of the year. I’d rather experience the fascination of the sunset in the Grand Traverse Bay rather than being stuck at home during this pandemic constantly getting bored. I’ve had a few days where I have rode my bike through my neighborhood, but it isn’t as enjoyable as walking through the downtown area of Traverse City and visiting the shops in the area. The breeze I tend to get in my area doesn’t feel as good as the breeze you get on Pangea’s Pizza’s rooftop seating while having a basket of cajun jerk french fries.— Gavin Meek, Detroit, MI
A strategic locationIf I could be stuck anywhere during this quarantine, it would be in Target. It is literally the smartest option and one of the best places on Earth. If your bored they have televisions, phones, and video games. If your hungry they have a food section and even a (Starbucks depending on your location). You also do not have to worry about weather or animals because it is indoors … It is also the perfect opportunity to do things almost everyone secretly wishes they could do in Target like create a mountain of pillows or ride the carts up and down the aisle.— Ashira, Cambria Heights
I would be stuck in my video game room. It‘s not necessarily paradise but it is my favorite pass time. I would never get bored because the vide games are with me. Honestly that sounds awesome to me.— Atticus, Earth
If I were stranded somewhere during this pandemic, I would like to be stranded on Pitcairn Island, South Pacific. I would want to be stuck there because the Island is very remote with only 50 people currently living there. The chances of me getting the virus is less likely in a more remote location rather that a place that is densely populated. Also, because it is not very populated, there will be more resources to go around like food and water. And because it is surrounded by water, there should be plenty of fish to eat and fish is a good source of vitamins and minerals. My last and final reason why I chose this place is because the views are amazing and I would probably spend my days swimming in the clear water and hiking in the forest.— Franklin, Philadelphia
I know this is weird, but I’d want to be stuck in Singapore Changi Airport. That place is huge, filled with entertainment, and looks absolutely stunning! I would just spend my days walking around and exploring that airport, I’ve heard they have entire malls, and even rooms for people to stay in. Being stuck in one place sucks, but at least I’m in an airport, when ever the pandemic ends, I’d be the one of the first to get on a flight and go home.— Khang T, Saint Louis
No place like homeDuring a pandemic, there’s no place I’d rather be than at home. A tropical island or some exotic place would seem nice at first, but then I’d start to feel lonely, and the fear of getting sick would outweigh any feelings of excitement for being on vacation. By being stuck at home, I’m with my family and near my friends. At home, the feeling of familiarity outweighs any fear of getting sick.— NK, King of Prussia
If I were to be stranded somewhere during a pandemic, I would want to be home. Yes, of course being on a tropical island with the sun shining down on you all day would be amazing. But during such a strange time, I’d want to be somewhere a safe and with people I trust. I would spend my time relaxing and learning new things, trying to find new hobbies. Being stuck somewhere not able to go home would be a challenge but that means you are in a whole new environment so I’d embrace it and see if there is something there I can do.— Brandon, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
If I was stuck somewhere I would want it to be my home because my home is were my family is and since I am just a kid, I can’t Survive anywhere else. Plus, I love my family, they give me food and shelter, they care for me. So if there is anywhere I would want to get stuck at. It would be my home.— Konrad Filbeck, Bethesda Maryland",real
1117,975,https://www.businessinsider.com/american-couple-kuwait-access-food-water-coronavirus-lockdown-2020-5,2020-05-15,An American couple is stuck in Kuwait under 24-hour curfew and isn't allowed to grocery shop. The US embassy hasn't been helpful.,"Klement and Linda Camaj temporarily moved to Kuwait in early March.

In early May, the country announced a 24-hour coronavirus curfew, only allowing residents with identification out to grocery shop by appointment.

The cheapest flights the couple found out of the country were $5,000 each, which was not possible for them.

The US embassy told them it couldn't help at this time.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

When Kuwait announced earlier this month that it was implementing a 24-hour lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus, residents flocked to grocery stores by the thousands.

People stood in lines — some blocks long — in heat that exceeded 90 degrees, according to Klement and Linda Camaj, two Americans in Kuwait for work.

Because the announcement fell during Ramadan, when Muslims traditionally fast from sunrise to sunset, some people waiting in the heat fainted, Linda Camaj told Business Insider.

""It was by far the most surreal thing I've ever experienced,"" said Linda, who said she waited in line on May 9 for six hours with her husband.

""I honestly thought the line was for something else,"" Klement said in the phone interview. ""We saw a handful of people pass out, completely passed out ... You have to take into consideration that they are fasting and they can't drink water. They can't eat.""

The Camajs, who both work at the Berlin-based think tank A Path for Europe, traveled to Kuwait City in early March. While news of the coronavirus had already been spreading, the couple thought that Kuwait may be spared from the kind of outbreaks other countries were experiencing.

As the situation got worse and the 24-hour curfew was announced the second week of May, the couple tried to stock up on groceries.

Despite waiting in lines for hours for two days before the lockdown went into effect, the stores closed before they made it inside.

People waited in lines for hours to get groceries ahead of Kuwait's total lockdown. Linda Camaj

Kuwait now allows residents to go grocery shopping by appointment. But because the Camajs are on tourist visas, they can only order delivery. Realizing that delivery would be nearly impossible with such high demand, they attempted to book a flight home, but the cheapest tickets they could find were for $5,000 each, they said.

Unable to pay that, and feeling out of options, they reached out to the US embassy in Kuwait by phone and email, hoping that they could provide the couple with documentation so they could leave the house to get food and drinking water.

The embassy representative asked them whether they had running water and internet, which they do, and then told them that they can either stick it out and wait for more delivery times to be added or pay for the flights home, according to an email viewed by Business Insider. Several phone calls went the same way, they told Business Insider.

The couple was shocked by the government's response.

""Am I going to fry the WiFi router and eat it?"" Klement told Business Insider.

""We would love to be able to go back to New York, we would love to,"" Linda said. ""But we don't have $10,000.""

The couple survived on chips and marshmallows for a day before a friend stepped up to help

After arriving home from two grocery stores on May 9 and 10, sweaty and empty-handed, the couple found snacks around the home to eat.

The 20-day total lockdown is planned to last through May 30, according to Reuters.

""On Monday, we shared a bottle of water, and marshmallows, and chips,"" Klement told Business Insider.

On Tuesday, a friend who lives nearby was able to get an appointment to go shopping and picked up a few items for the couple.

They didn't want to ask their friend to help because people are limited to shop for 30 items each week, so anything their friend bought on their behalf would be one less item for his family, Klement said.

The couple is keeping a tally of the days they have been confined to their apartment. Linda Camaj

The Camajs said that they realize that there are people in the world, including the United States and Kuwait, that are in far worse situations than they are during this pandemic.

While they are uncomfortable, they have been able to make it work, they said.

More than anything, the couple is frustrated with the lack of response from the US Department of State.

Klement said that when a friend from Britain, who is also in Kuwait, found herself in a similar situation her embassy sent groceries to the door.

He wasn't expecting that kind of help from the US State Department, but was hoping that he could be provided with a document that allowed them to leave the apartment to buy food.

The US Department of State didn't immediately return a Business Insider message seeking comment.

""I'm not asking for charity, just give me some sort of paper that lets me buy some food,"" Klement told Business Insider. ""I truly believe the role of my government is safeguarding its citizens.""

Linda and Klement Camaj are continuing to look for flights home

As the total lockdown continues, the couple is continuing to try to order groceries online.

The Kuwaiti government allows people to leave the house to walk between 4:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., but the streets have been crowded. Many people have been out without masks, which is in violation of the lockdown, Linda said, leaving the couple feeling too unsafe to leave their homes.

Last week Kuwait's Ministry of Health reported that it had registered its first three-digit jump in cases over 24 hours. On Thursday, an additional 947 positive coronavirus cases had been detected over a one day period, bringing the total in the country to 11,975, Al-Monitor reported.

Prior to the lockdown, the cases were in the 7,000 range, Klement said.

The couple feels that the rush to grocery stores over May 9 and 10 are responsible for the uptick.

The couple is beginning to give up trying to go straight home. Instead, they're looking at flights to Sweden or the Netherlands, where they have family. From there, they will look for flights to the US.

The couple said that after unsuccessful talks with the US embassy, they reached out to the Swedish and Dutch embassy. Neither one of them are citizens there, but found the people the reached on the phone to be more helpful to them in terms of offering advice.

""On the other hand, you have the world's greatest superpower that says 'sorry sir there's nothing I can do for you,'"" Klement said, referring to the US. ""I felt like I was calling Verizon.""",real
1126,848,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/13/how-coronavirus-could-upend-human-migration-251715,2020-05-13,How Coronavirus Could Make People Move,"He meant “countryside,” but it might not be a bad idea to change countries altogether. For example, America’s smaller second-tier cities and towns might be less dangerous if you’re worried about a pandemic spreading, but they don’t offer better medical care than wealthier cities; and, in the rural United States, health care can be much worse. By contrast, in countries with proper national health systems such as Canada, Germany and Britain, there is greater parity in medical care across the nation. Texas has been attracting droves of Rust Belt migrants since the financial crisis, but in terms of medical care, you’d be better off in Canada’s cowboy province of Alberta.

Furthermore, countries that signal significant investments in improving health care moving forward will attract mobile millennials and Gen-Zers who are looking for places that will ensure their well-being as they get older. But that might not always work: Even if Italy, Iran, Brazil and other countries whose municipal and federal governments have been overwhelmed by the virus seize upon public health as a national priority in the coming years, it’s a safe bet that Italians, Iranians, Brazilians and others who lived through similar chaos will still try harder to emigrate.

It is also worth exploring whether countries with low population density and less intensive participation in global supply chains are safer places to live. The areas at roughly 27 degrees latitude have the highest concentration of the world population, and thus are inherently more vulnerable to pandemics than less dense latitudes. By contrast, countries north of 50 degrees latitude—such as Canada—have a relatively low infection rate. Russia, though, which shares Canada’s latitude, has recently seen a spike in Covid infections and now ranks fourth in Europe in total cases.

In the Southern Hemisphere, New Zealand has a very low infection rate, and has the added virtue of being able to cut itself off with relative ease. But whereas New Zealand is hard to reach, Canada, which has an enviably effective health care system, has become an immigration superpower. In 2018, its net immigration was 350,000, higher than America’s 250,000 even though Canada has 1/10 the U.S. population. About 1 million Americans already live in Canada, with numbers ticking up since Trump’s election. In the years ahead, more Yanks may head north and become Canucks or move even further abroad. As one real estate executive mused on a webinar, “My job is selling U.S. properties to foreigners, but I’d be better off selling properties overseas to Americans.”

Health care isn’t the only factor that will motivate our next moves. Cost of living is a decisive issue as well. For youth, especially, the coronavirus economic shock is proving far more devastating than even the financial crisis. A decade ago, baby boomers and Gen-Xers who were foreclosed upon in the Northeast and Rust Belt migrated to the Sun Belt, many resettling in cheaper states and some becoming homeless. Looking ahead, millennials and Gen-Z—most of whom work in the gig economy—can’t afford to stay in place waiting for “the economy to reopen,” especially when they know that far fewer jobs are likely to be created than hoped. Indeed, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago—America’s three largest metro areas—have been losing people for nearly a decade. Some of the outflow has been backfilled by new arrivals, but not enough to keep population levels in those cities from dropping. A new inflow of arrivals into our most expensive cities is far less likely today, with unemployment potentially hovering at 20 percent for the foreseeable future and immigration grinding to a halt. Populations in America’s largest and most expensive cities could plunge.

Yet another reason to pick your next place of residence carefully: food supply. Climate change has introduced constant volatility into our agricultural systems. Droughts have been ravaging crops in the world’s largest food producing countries—the U.S., Brazil, India, Australia and China. In recent weeks, the coronavirus has only added stress to our agricultural supply chains. Farms from California to France are short of seasonal farm workers, leaving high-quality crops to rot. Major food producing countries such as Russia as well as smaller ones like Serbia have begun to ban the export of wheat, vegetables and food oils. This April, rice prices reached a 7-year high as the pandemic drove many to stockpile food supplies. The United States is facing a widespread meat shortage, as the virus requires closure of meat processing facilities.

Food shortages can be devastating: A decade ago, Russia’s wheat export ban sent prices skyrocketing for some of its largest customers. Six months later, revolutions driven by rising food prices engulfed Tunisia and Egypt. Even if commodities markets stabilize, countries self-sufficient in food and water will have greater appeal. Look for places that are investing in drought resistant crops as well as new hydroponic food production for everything from lettuce to fish farms and plant-based proteins.",real

This awkward position is most pronounced in its absence from the United Nations, which regards the government of the People’s Republic of China in Beijing as speaking for the island, even though it has never controlled Taiwan. This position was cemented in October 1971, when Taiwan was expelled from the UN and the seat allocated to China on the Security Council was taken over by the government of Mao Zedong. In the years since, as it has grown in clout, Beijing has used its position to block Taiwan’s efforts to participate in the global body and its organizations, including the WHO.

Taiwan’s status has led to a series of bizarre interactions involving international organizations. In the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, staff of the International Civil Aviation Organization blocked individuals on Twitter who pointed out or questioned Taiwan’s exclusion from the body. Then, in March, a WHO adviser appeared to hang up during a Skype interview with a Hong Kong reporter for RTHK when asked about Taiwan. After the clip gained substantial traction on social media and additional media coverage, the WHO said it was distorted by editing. RTHK has denied the claim.

Spurred by Taiwan’s handling of the coronavirus, however, a host of countries including the U.S., Japan, and New Zealand have called for it to be allowed to participate in the WHO and observe next week’s World Health Assembly, the group’s decision-making body. Taiwan participated as an observer at WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016 under the name Chinese Taipei, a special arrangement that was agreed to during the administration of Tsai’s more China-friendly predecessor. The more recent call for it to rejoin the talks was fiercely opposed by Beijing, which has reacted with anger at countries that have supported the island.

Read: China hawks are calling the coronavirus a ‘wake-up call’

Wu admitted it was highly unlikely that Taiwan would be able to attend the WHA meeting, which begins Monday. “The World Health Organization, especially the secretariat … seems to have very close connections with the Chinese authorities,” he told me, adding that Beijing was deploying “stunts” to keep Taiwan out. (A WHO lawyer said this week that the organization’s director-general has “no mandate” to invite Taiwan and it must be decided instead by member states. Wu called the statement “baloney.”)

Beijing’s pressure campaign has been directed not just at countries supporting Taiwan, but the island itself. A series of articles and comments from Chinese officials and think tanks have in recent days debated the merits of taking over Taiwan by force, while the world is distracted by the coronavirus. Shortly before I spoke with Wu, a U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from China, the sixth such passage this year. “There are conflicting signals coming out of China,” Wu told me. “The talk-tough type of rhetoric has been on the rise, but at the same time we also see a couple of [Chinese military] leaders saying that this is not the right time to take military actions against Taiwan … What we see across the Taiwan Strait is that China is increasing its presence and military threat against Taiwan.”",real

Instead, they’re now more than three weeks removed from their most recent game, and the odds of the 12 remaining scheduled ones ever being played are decreasing by the day. Most of the team also has left Chicago to ride out the pandemic in their respective hometowns and home countries, Jonathan Toews said earlier this week.

But two players — goaltender Robin Lehner and defenseman Erik Gustafsson — left Chicago a few weeks earlier.

As the trade deadline approached on Feb. 24, the NHL had successfully concluded the last 100 seasons it had begun. So the league conducted its newsiest day in typical chaotic fashion, and for the Hawks, that included shipping off Lehner and Gustafsson, pending free agents, for rebuilding assets.

The trades were criticized at the time — not that they took place but rather for the meager returns they brought.

A Vezina Trophy-caliber goalie for a second-round pick, average prospect (Slava Demin) and throw-in backup (Malcolm Subban) wasn’t a fair trade. A sometimes-elite offensive defenseman, although not so much this season, for a mere third-round pick wasn’t, either.

“The we-might-as-well trades Monday must not be interpreted as we-had-to trades — or, worse yet, it’ll-fix-things trades,” I wrote at the time.

Yet unbeknownst to Lehner, Gustafsson and Hawks general manager Stan Bowman, the season would be paused just over two weeks later.

The NHL still has not officially canceled the rest of the regular season or provided any deadline by which the postseason would need to begin, but given cancellation trends around the rest of the sports and entertainment industries, an eventual resumption feels tenuous.

Lehner, for one, has mentally written it off.

“You can’t turn 180 degrees and start playing again,” he told a Swedish newspaper last week. “I see a zero percent chance that you can save this season. Now I hope that next season can start as usual in October.”

So the roughly 20 regular-season games and hopefully multiple playoff series that the Golden Knights and Flames thought they’d get out of Lehner and Gustafsson, respectively, might end up being only a handful of meaningless games.

That would make the tepid prices they paid feel like exorbitant wastes of assets in hindsight, especially if one or both choose not to re-sign as unrestricted free agents whenever the offseason occurs. And, in turn, that would make Bowman’s decision to sell low on both players seem wiser, simply because he sold at all.

In the end, Lehner made only three appearances for Vegas before the shutdown. He was characteristically stellar in those games — going 3-0-0 with a .940 save percentage — but still barely had time to debut his new gold-and-black pads, much less make an actual impact on the franchise.

Gustafsson played in seven games for the Flames, with no goals and three assists, and made even less of an impact. His average ice time dropped from 20:40 with the Hawks to 18:01 with Calgary, and his shot-attempt (Corsi) ratio was an ugly 42.5 percent in those seven appearances.

The Hawks could even bring back both as free agents, although Gustafsson didn’t appear to be in their long-term plans and Lehner had harsh words for the Hawks’ front office — a recurring habit when discussing his former teams — after his trade.

Even if the Hawks don’t, however, they still come out of this strange, messy spring looking — albeit inadvertently — shrewder than they did a month ago.",real

Citing an unnamed US official, the Israeli daily revealed that the Trump administration has asked Israel to take concrete steps to reduce its ties with China.

So far, “the Israeli side has politely acknowledged our concerns without committing to action,” the unnamed official said.

“I don’t think polite deflection will cut it anymore,” the official said, adding ""this is a high priority for the US.”

One industry that the US has pinpointed as particularly sensitive is technology, so much so that the US has been eyeing Chinese-Israeli joint academic research in the field, the report said.

The US is especially concerned with the billions of dollars Chinese companies have invested in technologies that Israel has classified as commercial, but could be used by Chinese intelligence, like artificial intelligence, satellite communications and cybersecurity.

The demand came just days after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the occupied territories and asked Israel to reconsider its joint projects with China in areas with security risks and sensitivities for the US, including academic projects and technological research and development.

In previous public statements, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and other State Department officials had focused on the establishment of a more robust review process for foreign investments that could pose risks, and a reduction of reliance on China for emergency equipment in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

The US and Israel share some of the most sensitive intelligence with one another. In addition, American contractors sell Israel some of the most classified military hardware and weapons in the US like the F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, according to the Israeli daily.

The US is concerned that with China building most of Israel’s infrastructure – roads, trains, tunnels, ports and more – it will eventually gain access to the lines of communication through which Israel and the US communicate intelligence with one another. That is something that Washington will not tolerate, said the report.

For too long, Israel has cozied up to China while ignoring potential ramifications or fallout with its greatest ally, the United States, the newspaper said.

However, Tel Aviv could be on a collision course with Washington unless tight restrictions are imposed on Chinese investment in Israel, because the US president sees this both as a geopolitical security threat and a distraction from accomplishing the objectives of his trade war with China.

According to Israel's Army Radio on Tuesday, Tel Aviv has asked Washington for compensation in exchange for reducing ties with China - an offer that the US reportedly rejected.

The ongoing friction between the US and China has escalated in recent months in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the US has put pressure on many of its allies as a result.

The US has accused China of hiding news of the original outbreak of the novel coronavirus from the world.

President Trump has long called COVID-19 a “Chinese virus,” going so far as to accuse Chinese President Xi Jinping of standing behind a “disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.”

The current venomous rhetoric by Trump and his allies about China’s “culpability” for the COVID-19 pandemic has led to strong reactions from Chinese officials.

China's Ambassador to Israel Du Wei, who was found dead in his official residence in Herzliya last Sunday, had made a high-profile defense of his country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interview with Israel's Makor Rishon newspaper in April, Du addressed the matter of Chinese investments in Israel, expressing hope for further cooperation.

He also expressed hope to strengthen the ties between Israel and China, addressing the accusations leveled at his country as being the one responsible for the outbreak of the virus.

Mystery and speculation surrounds the death and comments from readers under an online article in the Jerusalem Post included: “Something smells fishy here.”

Another said there was “a long list of suspects,” and the envoy’s death was like something in a spy movie, or the US murder investigation show CSI (Crime Scene Investigation).

Others suggested a link to Pompeo’s recent whirlwind visit to Israel, during which he was overtly critical of China, and demanded that Israel stop sharing confidential military information with Beijing.",fake

Gavin Newsom is proposing that the state close two prisons, in part due to a decline in tax revenue amid the pandemic.

Over 500 California prisoners currently have COVID-19. At least five have died.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Left-leaning activists for social justice do not, typically, have kind words for austerity, which brings to mind shuttered schools and trimmed welfare rolls. But when California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined plans this week to slash the state's budget, citing a freefall in tax revenue due to the pandemic, there was qualified praise from some over his decision to cut funding for prisons.

California currently has over 117,000 people in its prisons, more than any other state except for Texas. But the number of incarcerated persons has been falling — by 8% just this year — and that, the product of reduced sentences for drug crimes and efforts to address overcrowding, has meant the state is in a position to begin closing some of its prisons.

In January, Newsom, a Democrat, wanted to close one detention center. Now he wants to close two — and to do it fast. That will save money; according to the state's Legislative Analyst's Office, by more than $100 million per year. It could also save lives.

""As we have seen, jails and prisons have become petri dishes for this pandemic,"" state Rep. Sydney Kamlager, a Democrat from Los Angeles, told Business Insider. ""Closed quarters, lack of circulating air, and staff and vendors who are not regularly tested — and walk in and out — are recipes for public health disasters.""

At least five people have died from COVID-19 while incarcerated in a state prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; another 524 currently have caught the disease while behind bars.

Last month, Kamlager, who chairs the state committee on incarcerated women, told Business Insider that she hoped that efforts to reduce the prison population, in an effort to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, would extend beyond the current crisis.

Amber-Rose Howard, executive director of Californians United for a Responsible Budget, ""is excited to see the commitment from the governor to close prisons."" But her organization, a coalition of 70 activist groups that advocate cutting prison spending, says the governor's proposal is just a start.

""We believe that California can close five prisons in the next five years,"" Howard told Business Insider. In part, that can be achieved by accelerating early release, as California has started to do in response to the coronavirus. ""Over 20% of the prison population is over the age of 55,"" she noted. ""We need to see the state pushing for elder parole modifications that would release a larger population of people, who statistically have the least risk of contact with law enforcement after release.""

Newsom's proposal, which will require approval by California's Democratic-controlled legislature, already gestures at that, proposing to cut the maximum length of parole — and thus the chances one could be incarcerated over a parole violation — from five years to 24 months.

But with 34 prisons, and plans to close only two over the next three years, critics of mass incarceration see much room for improvement, from the governor granting clemency more often, to voters themselves overturning the state's notorious ""three strikes"" sentencing law.

""I believe there is a better way,"" Rep. Kamlager commented. ""The current system is not it.""

Progressive Radio Network, March 10, 2020

In recent weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has dominated the news at the expense of everything else that is critical and urgent in our lives. As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body's immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection.

There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. Everyone has likely had a coronavirus infection at some time in their lives. However, two strains -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) -- are much more severe. Between the years 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 these strains respectively were observed to be lethal. However, during this periods, total deaths were less than one thousand. SARS has the ability to infect the lower respiratory system as well. The current strain being called Cov19 is a new mutation that is being recognized as a novel SARS. As of this writing, the current coronvirus has been attributed to over 4,000 deaths, the large majority among the elderly. In a recent press conference the Surgeon General remarked that the average age of deaths was 80.

Compared to other viral infections that target the respiratory tract, especially influenza, there has been far less research either to understand the pathway of infection and the drugs or natural substances to battle the virus. It remains uncertain how long immunity, if any, lasts after infection. Seemingly, immunity wanes quickly. Consequently, since coronavirus is most often responsible for a flu-like common cold, recommended prevention and treatment protocols are largely similar to the flu.

During a recent coronavirus task force meeting, Trump asked whether the flu vaccine would protect against the coronavirus. The flu vaccine is not only influenza-specific, it is also flu strain specific. It offers absolutely no protection to any other viruses. Nevertheless we are going to likely witness a sharp rise in propaganda recommending flu vaccines to fight the coronavirus scare. The belief is that increasing national flu vaccination compliance will not only reduce the risks of flu infection but will also help divert money away from flu infections to better deal with the rising coronavirus cases.

But there is a caveat. A very serious caveat.

Sometimes the universe has an unusual way of providing warnings that we have an opportunity to either heed or disregard to our benefit or detriment. On December 31, 2019 in order to usher in the New Year, China reported the first case of an ""unusual pneumonia"" in its port city of Wuhan. A week later on January 7th, the pathogen was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus. That same month, the prestigious journal Vaccine, published a study conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Researchers investigated viral interference due to receiving the flu shot; in other words, does the flu vaccine make a recipient more susceptible to other non-influenza respiratory viral infections? The study's conclusions state ""Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus.""

This is not the first time that viral interference from the flu vaccine has been associated with an increase in non-influenza respiratory infections. A much more thorough study, an actual clinical trial, was conducted by the University of Hong Kong in 2012. The double blind randomized controlled trial followed a group of flu-vaccinated versus placebo-vaccinated children between 6 and 15 years of age over the course of nine months to determine infection rates from 19 other respiratory viruses. The study found ""no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influence influenza infection between recipients of the [influenza vaccine] or placebo."" However, it was the dramatic number of incidences of non-influenza infections found in the flu-vaccinated group (105 cases), which included coronavirus, as opposed to 54 cases among those who received a placebo. In other words, the results suggest that receiving the flu shot may increase one's risk of contracting another infectious virus by almost 100 percent.

A recent analysis out of China reviewing rates of infection, targeted populations and mortality reported that the worst hit group is older people, particularly those who have immune-compromised conditions: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory illnesses, etc. Taking this statistic into account, we may note that the majority of American adults have some type of chronic condition. It is estimated that 60% of American adults have at least one underlying health condition and 40% have two or more. For example, 33 million have diabetes and an estimated 84 million are pre-diabetic; heart disease affects 121 million and there are approximately 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses annually. All of these people, therefore, have either a mild to severe compromised immune system.

A Swiss study noted that the SARS coronavirus and influenza share two of the same proteases in targeted cells -- TMPRSS2 and HAT. These are responsible for activating the spread of the virus at the point of infection and contribute to their pathogenesis in an infected cell. Therefore it may be partially conjecture on our part to suggest that natural supplements and botanical remedies that have been shown in the scientific literature to be effective against influenza may more or less effective against coronavirus as well. In fact, last month a study was released by Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in the Journal of Medical Virology recommending that patients' nutritional status should be evaluated before any conventional treatment. - The hospital recommended a regimen that included Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, Omega-3, Selenium, Zinc, gammaglobulin A administered intravenously and Chinese traditional medicine

Therefore we have scoured the peer-reviewed literature on the National Institutes of Health's Library of Medicine database to identify compelling studies that may warrant vitamin, antioxidant, and botanical supplementation as a means to protect ourselves from coronavirus and other viral infections. These have been shown to either have strong antiviral properties in general or have known biomolecular effects to strengthen the immune system against microbial infection. We are not offering prescriptions. This is just a summary of some important scientific information for you to make better informed decisions for protecting yourself while the coronavirus wends its course.

BOTANICALS:

Astragulus

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. Astragulus is not only a very popular plant used in TCM, but it is also one of the most researched and promising botanical plants shown to have antiviral properties. In both TCM and Ayruveda medicinal formulas astrugulus has been prescribed for centuries because of its effectiveness against infections and over-stressed respiratory conditions. Compounds, notably saponins, found in astragulus have been well researched and found to hinder influenza proliferation. The US Department of Agriculture's Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.

Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China conducted a study published in the journal Microbiological Pathology that concluded

""Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus""

In China, which has a large poultry industry, avian coronaviruses are a serious threat to chicken farmers. Chinese farmers will often use astragulus in feed to protect the birds from infection as well as pig feed to ward off porcine circovirus.

Two weeks ago, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine completed an analysis of previous research looking at the benefits of Chinese herbal formulas against the SARS coronavirus and H1N1 flu (swine flu). In 3 studies, among participants who took formulas against SARS, none contracted the illness. Nor did any contract H1N1 influenza in four additional studies. A primary ingredient in these formulas' was astragulus.

Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children's Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Cov19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine. In cases where there are signs of severe weakness and stress observed in the lungs and spleen, a formula called Liu Jun Zi is being prescribed, which includes astragulus and ginseng as two primary botanicals.

Last week, the prestigious journal Science published a review out of Yun-nan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China that investigated the great disparities in infection and mortality rates between different provinces - Wuhan being the most severe. In the provinces with the lowest infection rates, there was between an 84% to 98% use of TCM formulas. Again, two of the main ingredients were Astragulus and Ginseng.

Licorice Root (Glycyrrhizin Acid)

In traditional medicine licorice root has been used to relieve and treat ulcers, sore throats, bronchitis, coughs, adrenal insufficiencies and allergic diseases. Ancient manuscripts from China, India and Greece all include licorice for treating respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. In China and Japan licorice's main antiviral compounds are known as glycyrrhizins (GL). For 20 years glycyrrhizins have been used intravenously to treat chronic hepatitis B and C infections with very rare side effects. It has also been shown to induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells and Karposi sarcoma related to herpesvirus. Therefore it was an unexpected surprise to discover that there is notable research on glycyrrihizin's effectiveness against coronavirus and in particular SARS.

Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL's effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School investigated several antiviral compounds to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections. Of all the compounds tested, licorice's GL was the most effective. The scientists concluded that ""Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.""

The above research was later replicated at Sun Yat Sen University in China and published in the Chinese journal Bing Du Xue Bao. The researchers identified several derivatives of glycyrrhizin as primary molecules with antiviral properties. In addition to being effective against the SARS coronavirus, they also found it may be effective against herpes, HIV, hepatitis and influenza.

Earlier in 2005, a team of scientists from Goethe University in Germany and the Russian Academy of Sciences had already identified the antiviral activity of GL against SARS coronavirus. The molecule showed a ten-fold increase in anti-SARS activity compared to other potential treatments tested. One conjugate of GL had a 70-fold increase. That study was published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry. During that same year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences screened over 200 botanical plants used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to find those with the strong potency SARS coronavirus. Four botanicals stood out. One of the four was licorice's glycyrrhizin

Extract of licorice root is the most effective and glycyrrhizin is also available as a separate botanical supplement.

Elderberry (Sambucus nigra)

Elderberry has become a popular supplement for relieving symptoms of the common cold and flu infections. It is found wild worldwide and is part of many of the world's indigenous pharmacopias. There are many species of elderberry; the species Sambucus nigra seemingly has been shown to have the most medicinal qualities. When purchasing Elderberry or Sambucus, it is recommended to note it is Sambucus nigra. It is better to use a prepared formula rather than try to make it on your own from fresh berries and flowers. Elderberries contain cyangenic glycosides that can be poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea and weakness.

Most research has focused on elderberry's therapeutic value against influenza.

Hadassah University Hospital in Israel found that elderberry was effective in vitro against 10 different influenza strains. Cytokine activity for IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 all significantly increased thereby confirming its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.

Another Israeli study by Hebrew University in Jerusalem and published in the Journal of Internal Medical Research found that participants enrolled with existing flu like symptoms who took 15 ml of elderberry syrup 4 times a day recovered four days earlier than those on medications or a placebo.

Finally, a more recent 2019 study by the University of Sydney observed that certain compounds in elderberry inhibit the flu virus's entry and replication in human cells.

However, there is also research showing elderberry's positive impact on coronavirus infections.

In 2014, researchers at Emory University noted that elderberry extract inhibited coronavirus virility at the point of infection. The scientists hypothesized that elderberry rendered the virus non infectious.

One of the better studies came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. The researchers used an ethanol extract of Sambucus stem (not the berry) and observed its potential against coronavirus strain NL63

It is important to remember that deaths being attributed to the coronavirus are more often than not complicated by secondary infections that are often bacterial such as pneumonia. In addition to its antiviral properties, elderberry is also effective against pathogenic bacteria. Under laboratory conditions at Justus Liebig University in Germany, elderberry was shown to be very effective against several bacteria that are responsible for pneumonia during flu-like infections, and against Influenza A and B viruses in particular

Echinacea

A systematic review of the existing research before 2011 by the University of British Columbia and published in the journal Pharmaceuticals, concluded:

""all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation""

There are different species of Echinacea. The species Echinacea purpurea has been shown to be most effective and targets the most infectious pathogens. When purchasing echinacea, be certain it is the purpurea strain.

Echinicea does present limitations depending upon the severity of an infection. Once a cold caused by any one of the various cold viruses, including coronavirus, more deeply infects the bronchia and the lower lung, echinacea does not appear to be helpful. It is more effective with upper respiratory tract infections.

One of the largest placebo double blind studies on echinacea was conducted by Cardifff University in the UK. The study followed participants for four months and confirmed the safety of long term echinacea supplementation. It also observed a statistically significant decrease in cold episodes in the echinacea group.

There are no strong studies showing echinacea's effectiveness against coronavirus. Up until 2014, only one study looked at its bioactivities against coronavirus and that was a mouse model which required high doses of the plant extract.

In 2012, Griffith University in Australia undertook one notable double blind study to determine whether echinacea provided protection to air travelers. The study concluded:

""Supplementation with standardized Echinacea tablets, if taken before and during travel, may have preventive effects against the development of respiratory symptoms during travel involving long-haul flights.""

As a piece of consumer advice, a Cornell University study looked at the medicinal properties throughout different parts of the echinicea plant: leaves, stems, bark, roots, etc. The scientists noted that only echinacea extracts that contain the root showed significant antiviral properties. Echinacea appears to modify the clinical course of flu-like respiratory infection by acting upon IL-8, IL-10 and IFN cytokine activity beneficially.

Olive Leaf

Oleuropein (OLE) is the most important biomolecule in the olive tree that contributes to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral activities and effects. One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body's cells.

There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. According to analysis conducted by the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome of the oleuropein content in different parts of the olive plant, extracts made from buds and flowers showed the greatest strength and potency.

Olive leaf has not been shown to be particularly effective against viral upper respiratory infections; however there is considerable evidence to support olive leaf's ability to strengthen the immune system against other infectious viral diseases in addition to possessing many anti-inflammatory qualities.

There are only a few studies showing olive leaf's effectiveness against respiratory viruses. One randomized trial performed by the University of Auckland in New Zealand suggests olive leaf can contribute to treating respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus. A 2001 study out of the University of Hong Kong identified 6 separate antiviral agents in olives that were effective against parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Olive leaf is also effective against bacterial pathogens. Most bacterial pneumonias are gram-positive. According to a joint study by Arab American University and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, OLE worked best against gram-positive pathogens but gram-negative organisms appeared to be resistant to OLE (eg, E coli, Salmonellas, etc.).

But OLE does possess notable anti-viral properties. The current Cov19 pandemic appears to utilize the host cell's ACE2 receptor. This same receptor is also activated in HIV infections. This is one reason why patients infected with this new coronavirus strain are being prescribed HIV drugs. Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain?

New York University biochemists identified olive leaf extract's anti-HIV activity to modulate the host cell gene expression due to HIV infection. In fact, olive leaf extracts reversed HIV-1 infections. This was published in Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Research. The conclusions state, ""Treatment with OLE reverses many of these HIV-1 infection-associated changes."" Another joint study by NYU and Harvard Medical School concluded that OLE from olive leaf is ""a unique class of HIV-1 inhibitors"" and is ""effective against viral fusion and integration.""

Oregano Oil

Oregano possesses a compound called carvacrol that has been shown to be antiviral. Although it has been tested on several influenza and flu-like respiratory viruses, it does not appear to have been tested against coronavirus.

Soochow University in China and the University of Oklahoma published a study in the BMC Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine focusing on oregano's antiviral properties against influenza viruses. Although oregano did not kill the virus it nevertheless inhibited the virus' ability to translate proteins responsible for the viral binding to cells.

A University of Putra Malaysia meta-analysis of existing research of different plant essential oils reported oregano was strongest against the flu-like viruses adenovirus and coxsackie virus.

A 2010 randomized double blind study study published in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine suggested oregano was beneficial as a throat spray and showed significant and immediate improvement of upper respiratory infectious ailments.

University of Arizona published a paper in the Journal of Applied Microbiology investigating oregano's antiviral properties when used as a sanitizer. The study focused on one flu-like virus, novovirus. If sprayed on surfaces, carvacrol will kill the virus within 15 minutes of exposure. The most recent research into Cov19's surface life -- living outside of animal host -- is 9 days.

Other Botanicals

Saikosaponins is an important family of compounds found in the Bupleurum plant, which has been shown to have possible anti-coronavirus properties.

Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan examined many of the derivatives of saikosaponins and observed it has very potent anti-coronaviral activity that interferes with the early stage of the virus' replication. Several companies offer Bupleurum online

University College Dublin and Sichuan Agricultural University conducted a systematic meta-review of the existing medical literature on Chinese herbs that may prevent and treat viral respiratory infections. Among the most promising herbs against SARS coronavirus were panax ginseng, glycyrrhizin from licorice, and Isatis tinctoria, commonly known as woad or Asp of Jerusalem. Isatis is also available online.

Houttuynia cordata also known as fish mint, rainbow plant, fish wort, bishop's weed is indigenous to Southeast Asia. This botanical directly inhibits coronavirus' protease and blocks the viral RNA polymerase activity. A study out of Tsinghua University in Beijing found it significantly reduces fevers, sore throat and coughs due to the SARS virus. Tinctures of this plant are available online.

SUPPLEMENTS:

Vitamin C

Unlike the US, most of the world, especially in Asia and continental Europe, recognizes Vitamin C as an important anti-viral agent. It is also a remarkable antioxidant shown to ward off infections. At this moment, China is conducting several clinical trials with intravenous Vitamin C to treat patients infected with the Cov19 strain. The city government of Shanghai is now actively treating patients with intravenous Vitamin C. A trial at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan is using 24,000 mg per day intravenously. The Wuhan study can be viewed on the US National Library of Medicine's website here: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533

Until recently, Vitamin C has not been tested against coronavirus. There was one study performed to see whether the vitamin protected chick embryo organs from infection by avian coronavirus -- a very common infection in fowl. That study showed the vitamin positively increased embryo resistance against the virus. Otherwise, Vitamin C has only been well studied against other viral infections, especially influenza.

Seoul National University College of Medicine concluded that Vitamin C is an essential factor for anti-viral immune responses at the early stage of Influenza A infection.

In 2017 the University of Helsinki reviewed 148 studies that indicated Vitamin C may alleviate or prevent infections caused by bacteria and viruses. The most extensive indication studied was the common cold. Among people who are physically active, Vitamin C was most beneficial. However, many studies relied on very low Vitamin C doses, which likely contributed to the minor benefits observed. Some of these were as low as 100 mg daily. In addition, the studies showed that colds' duration was frequently shorter and less severe among people with sufficient Vitamin C levels.

An early randomized double blind trial to investigate Vitamin C's ability to protect elderly hospitalized patients from acute respiratory infections was conducted at Hudderfield University in the UK. The study relied on a very low dose of 200 mg per day. Nevertheless, those who received the vitamin faired significantly better than those taking placebo.

Finally, there was another early controlled placebo study involving 715 students between the ages 18-32 taking 1000 mg four times daily. The test group had an 85% decrease in flu and cold symptoms compared to the control.

Vitamin D

Barely a week goes by without another study appearing in the peer-reviewed literature that looks at either Vitamin D's therapeutic characteristics or the risks of Vitamin D deficiency. A high number of otherwise healthy adults have been reported to have low levels of vitamin D, mostly at the end of the Winter season. Deficiency rates vary between 42% for the entire population to 82% for Black Americans and 63% for Latinos. People who are housebound, institutionalized and those who work night shifts are most likely to be vitamin D deficient. This includes many elderly people who receive limited exposure to sunlight.

It has been shown that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase risk in autoimmunity illnesses and greater susceptibility to infection. It also boosts up the body's mucosal defenses which are critical for protecting ourselves from infectious respiratory viruses

Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with a global collaborative study to follow up on a Cochrane analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving 11,000 participants confirmed that vitamin D. taken daily or weekly significantly cut the risk of respiratory infections in half

Jikei University School of Medicine in Japan conducted a randomized double blind placebo trial to measure the rate that Vitamin D reduced seasonal influenza A. Almost twice as many participants in the placebo group came down with the flu compared to the Vitamin D group. The Japanese scientists also observed that people with a history of asthma were best protected.

For children, a Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia meta review identified 13 of 18 studies confirming that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased incidences of acute lower respiratory infection.

N-Acetyl Cysteine

Oxidative stress is a well known pathway for microbial infections such as viruses and bacterial pneumonia, especially in the lungs.

When the lungs are subject to serious oxidative stress, there is an increase in inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-8 and Tumor necrosis factor or TNF. Each of these cytokines have been shown repeatedly in clinical research to play a role in different respiratory infections including influenza, coronavirus, echovirus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus and others. Therefore, certain antioxidants can alleviate lung damage due to oxidative stress.

N-acetyl cysteine is one of these extremely important antioxidants. It exhibits both direct and indirect antioxidant properties. The indirect benefit is that it increases the concentration of another important antioxidant, glutathione, in the lung cells.

There is no confirmatory evidence that NAC directly targets flu or flu-like viral infections; however it has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of clinical symptoms.

Johann Goethe University Department of Virology observed that NAC inhibits the replication of seasonal human influenza A viruses by decreasing several these pro-inflammatory molecules. The scientists recommend that NAC should be included as an additional treatment option in the case of an influenza A pandemic.

An Italian randomized placebo study conducted at the University of Genoa found that subjects who were already suspected of having contact with the H1N1 flu virus who were placed under NAC treatment had a 25% rate of experiencing symptoms compared to 79% in the placebo group.

Certain cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor and IL-6, have been associated with the pathogenesis of influenza and can increase the risk of mortality. In a mouse study, Italian researchers at Zambon Research Center gave NAC to flu-infected mice with a significant decrease in mortality.

Colloidal Silver

Nanoparticle or colloidal silver has been studied extensively for its anti-bacterial properties but less so for infectious viruses. Most studies for silver's antiviral activities have focused on HIV-1, Hepatitis B, herpesvirus and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV.

In a 2005 issue of the Journal of Nanotechnology, the University of Texas and Mexico University observed that silver nanoparticles could kill HIV-1 within 3 hours, and they suspected that this may be true for many other viruses as well. However, this conclusion may be too premature and more research is necessary.

There are studies showing silver's efficacy against respiratory viruses. One large study by Japan's National Defense Medical College Research Institute, published in the Journal of Molecular Sciences, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus.

In 2010, the University of Naples measured silver nanoparticles' capabilities to reduce and prevent infection from the parainfluenza type 3 virus. The scientists hypothesized that the silver may block the virus' interaction with the cell. Then a joint study by Deakin University in Australia and Osaka University in Japan found that colloidal silver significantly protected cells from H3N2 flu infection and prevented viral growth in the lungs

Finally, colliodal or nanoparticle gold has also been shown to inhibit the flu virus' binding capaticity to a cell's plasma membrane. That research was carried out by Freie University in Germany.

Conclusion:

Yes, we should be concerned about the coronavirus' high infectious rate. At the moment, the primary solutions being sought to handle the crisis is to spend billions of dollars to develop an effective vaccine and an accurate diagnostic kit. Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system.

Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment. Repeated washing of our hands for a full minute with soap water. Rub surfaces with alcohol at home and work and allow it to sit for 30 seconds. Likewise, wipe down door handles and telephone receivers. Quarantining people who have been exposed is important until they test negative. Closing schools is prudent. And if a vaccine is eventually developed and shown to be safe and effective that is another recourse. However none of the above protects the immune system in the event of coming into contact with the virus. We believe that the recommended natural solutions shared above, since it is supported in the peer reviewed scientific literature, is something everyone can do. Besides, it is safe and not expensive. Therefore these natural solutions too should be considered as a viable and effective recourse to lessen this pandemic's fatal effects.",fake

But, everyone should agree on this point:

No government can force anyone who has reached legal adulthood to be vaccinated for the coronavirus [we are protected by the Nuremberg Code].

Equally, no government can vaccinate minors for the coronavirus against the will of their parents or guardians.

Please SIGN this urgent petition which urges policymakers at every level of government to reject calls for mandatory coronavirus vaccination.

Fear of a disease – which we know very little about, relative to other similar diseases – must not lead to knee-jerk reactions regarding public health, nor can it justify supporting the hidden agenda of governmental as well as non-governmental bodies that have apparent conflicts of interest in plans to restrict personal freedoms.

The so-called “public health experts” have gotten it wrong many times during the current crisis. We should not, therefore, allow their opinions to rush decision-makers into policies regarding vaccination.

And, while some people, like Bill Gates, may have a lot of money, his opinion and that of his NGO (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) – namely, that life will not return to normal till people are widely vaccinated – should not be permitted to influence policy decisions on a coronavirus vaccination program.

Finally, we must also not allow the rush by pharmaceutical companies to produce a new coronavirus vaccine to, itself, become an imperative for vaccination.

Unwitting citizens must not be used as guinea pigs for New World Order ideologues, or Big Pharma, in pursuit of a vaccine (and, profits) which may not even protect against future mutated strains of the coronavirus.

And it goes without saying that the production of vaccines using aborted babies for cell replication is a total non-starter, as the technique is gravely immoral.

However, if after sufficient study of the issue, a person who has reached the age of majority wishes to be vaccinated with a morally produced vaccine, along with his children, that is his business.

But we cannot and will not permit the government to make that decision for us.

SUMMARY: Republicans who just bailed out thousands of private companies and supported a vast increase in federal deficit-spending now want states to declare bankruptcy. Is that a smart idea? Can we save our cities when the pandemic ends, or will they now decline for decades? Biden needs to respond personally to the sexual-assault allegation.

Should states just ""declare bankruptcy?""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump Drew Angerer/Getty Images

As states shell out billions of dollars on unemployment and other responses to the coronavirus—and as business shutdowns and payroll and sales tax declines whack tax revenue—state budgets are being blown apart.

New York State, for example, foresees at least a $10 billion to $15 billion budget shortfall this year.

To address this, many governors and economists are recommending that the federal government put emergency funding for the states into the next coronavirus response package. Some members of the GOP, however — including President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Florida Sen. Rick Scott — have responded by saying that states should instead just ""declare bankruptcy.""

Is this a smart idea?

No.

Forcing states to declare bankruptcy right now would have the same effect as forcing dozens of giant airlines, hotel chains, and other companies to declare bankruptcy — namely, triggering millions of additional layoffs as states are forced to cut spending and, thereby, radically worsening the country's overall economic crisis.

The federal government has rightly chosen to extend lifelines to private companies hit by the crisis, and these bailouts have helped stabilize the economy. The GOP and White House helped design and pass these emergency funds to the private sector. So the suggestion that states should declare bankruptcy, when companies should not, stems mostly from political ideology rather than economic common sense.

Another argument put forth by the GOP — in particular, Florida Sen. Scott, himself a former governor — is that solvent states shouldn't have to bail out insolvent ones.

This argument sounds reasonable at first. Some states do have persistent fiscal challenges. And it is fine and reasonable for states that run tight ships to complain about having to support profligate neighbors. But the argument ignores the fact that some of the states that need help now normally subsidize the states that are now complaining.

An analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found that, in fiscal 2018, 8 states sent more money to the federal government than they received back. The 42 other states, meanwhile, ran a deficit with the federal government, meaning that they received net subsidies.

In Rockefeller's chart below, the orange states—including New York—sent net money to Washington. All the others received it.

Given the deficit the federal government is running — an annual deficit that has ballooned to nearly $4 trillion in recent weeks with the passage of massive emergency spending plans approved by members of both parties — it's also hypocritical for national leaders to lecture state leaders about being fiscally responsible.

The federal government doesn't have to think about ""declaring bankruptcy,"" because we citizens have given it the power to print and borrow money. The federal government is supposed to use this power to help us, and it is.

The next important way the federal government can help us is to enable our state and local governments get through this crisis without having to cut services and fire millions of Americans.

Then, once the crisis is over, if the GOP still feels passionate about it, we can have a discussion about how and when states should subsidize each other. — HB

How to save our cities as the pandemic ends

Post-pandemic cities will be depressing places.

The disease is already undoing the density that's made downtowns so bustling, active, walkable, energy efficient, and rich. Post-pandemic, many who can afford to work and live remotely will likely shy away from the urban core.

The decline in workers, shoppers, and tourists will devastate the restaurant and retail economies. Theaters and art galleries will close. There will be a drop in new immigrants remaking neighborhoods and enriching urban culture.

It will suck.

There's almost universal agreement about how cities are likely to suffer. (Read these excellent stories if you want to feel really gloomy.) But there's less certainty about how they can recover.

The Atlantic's Derek Thompson notes that there's a natural boom-bust cycle in American cities: They get dense and rich, then empty out because of some unexpected societal upheaval (deindustrialization, urban unrest). This eventually lowers rents, which draws immigrants and cultural pioneers, and that in turn attracts money and more people, and the cities thrive again. If COVID-19 hollows out downtowns, they will eventually come back,

But ""eventually"" is a mighty long time — probably decades. That's not solace for city lovers today. Is there any way to speed up the post-pandemic cycle?

I think there is.

The post-pandemic city won't work until people feel safe, and for now, they won't feel safe without a transformation in the urban environment. Israel's an instructive example: After a spate of terrorist bombings 20 years ago, Israel began placing guards at the entrances to malls and markets. Israelis quickly felt safe shopping and gathering again. It was costly, but a lot cheaper than abandoning the markets.

Post-pandemic, American cities will need to make an even more sweeping physical transformation, and fast. Handwashing stations at every storefront; cleaning teams to wipe down surfaces; the spreading out of tables in restaurants and chairs in classrooms and seats in theaters; touchless pickup of groceries; touchless thermometer stations...the list goes on and on. And we don't yet know which of these changes will make people feel safe from infection (or actually make them be safe).

So here's a free idea for a billionaire tired of cocooning in a New Zealand bunker. Pick a single block in a city you love and fund every restaurant, apartment building, school, police station, day care, and office on that block to make themselves safe. Retrofit the restaurants to be less dense, and build a separate pickup entrance. Pay the daycare center to have a full-time cleaning person. Install handwashing stations in every classroom and office.

Create a model for a post-pandemic urban neighborhood, where people live and work together in the new way. If it works, it will quickly be copied in other neighborhoods and other cities, and cities will recover much faster. —DP

Pressure increases on Biden to personally address sexual-assault allegation

Yesterday, Insider published more corroboration of the 1993 sexual-assault allegation against former Vice President Biden.

Biden's campaign responded by pointing to its previous assertion that the allegation made by former staffer Tara Reade is false.

But there is now corroboration for this allegation, as there has been for similar allegations against other high-profile government figures, including Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and President Trump.

Kavanaugh directly responded to the allegations against him. President Trump has directly —and dismissively—responded to the many sexual assault allegations against him.

So Biden will likely have to respond himself to this one. And how he does so will be revealing.

Even as Democrats cringe at the idea that their leading hope to win back the White House has been hit with an allegation like this, they should want to hear what he has to say about it.

Will the allegation hurt Biden's chances of winning the Presidency? Or, like the plans of the latest corroborator of the allegation, Lynda LaCasse, will Democrats decide to vote for Biden? — HB

A silver lining… Miami just went seven weeks without a homicide.

An empty Ocean Drive amid the coronavirus pandemic. Taylor Borden/Business Insider

That's the longest stretch since 1957, and it is a rare bit of good pandemic news.

But is COVID-19 the universal crime fighter? The effect of the pandemic on crime is surprisingly erratic, and not yet clear. Murders are down in some places, but up in others. Property crime is surging in some cities, while drug crimes are down. Authorities expected a rise in domestic violence since people are cooped up at home, but are unsettled to find that some cities, including Los Angeles, are experiencing a drop in domestic violence calls, leading to fears that victims are afraid to call the police because they can't get away from their abusers. — DP

Blaming the victims of COVID-19

Last week the New York Times profiled a Fox-News-watching bar owner in Brooklyn who died after expressing skepticism about Covid-19. This week, the Washington Post took a turn: ""A Virginia preacher believed 'God can heal anything.' Then he caught coronavirus.""

In neither story was the victim the actual target: The purpose of the Times piece was to smack Fox News, especially Sean Hannity, for downplaying the disease. (Hannity is now threatening to sue the Times about it.) And the Post paints a subtle, sympathetic portrait of preacher Landon Spradlin, and criticizes others for mocking Spradlin. But the nut of the story was: Spradlin —""an avid Trump supporter"" posted something on Facebook about ""mass hysteria"" around the virus, then caught COVID-19 and died.

I don't get the point of these stories, which reduce rich, complicated lives to an ironic punchline. I also suspect they infuriate the very people they are intended to reach. — DP",real

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comments at a press conference on the sidelines of an annual parliament meeting on Sunday, following calls from the United States and Australia for a probe into the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

""China is open to working with the international scientific community to look into the source of the virus,"" Wang said, adding, ""At the same time, we believe that this should be professional, fair and constructive.""

""Fairness means the process be free of political interference, respect the sovereignty of all countries, and oppose any presumption of guilt,"" the Chinese diplomat said.

Since the flu-like pathogen broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late December, Beijing and Washington have clashed over the virus spread and its origin, further increasing tensions between the world's two largest economies.

US President Donald Trump keeps referring to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the Chinese virus. Beijing has hit back by suggesting that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan and initiated the outbreak.

Trump has over the past weeks claimed that there is evidence Beijing created the coronavirus in a medical lab in the Chinese city. This is while the US intelligence agencies say they have seen no evidence to show the virus is “man-made.”

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has on several occasions accused China of not being transparent and honest about the coronavirus pandemic in the country.

China has fiercely defended its handling of the new coronavirus, repeatedly saying it “has been nothing but open, transparent and responsible” in informing the WHO and affected countries about the pandemic.

Scientific studies have already suggested that the virus originated through natural processes.

Wang further blasted US politicians’ effort to ""fabricate rumors"" about the pathogen's origins and ""stigmatize China"".

He also urged the United States to stop wasting time in its fight against the virus deadly and rather than spreading lies and attacking China, share the Asian country’s experience in combating the epidemic.

""Regretfully, in addition to the raging coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the United States. This political virus is using every opportunity to attack and smear China,"" Wang said.

""Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and concocted too many lies about China and plotted too many conspiracies,"" he added.

""I want to say here: Don't waste precious time any longer, and don't ignore lives.""

""What China and the United States need to do the most is to first learn from each other and share their experience in fighting against the epidemic, and help each country fight it.""

When asked if the relations between the US and China and would further worsen, the Chinese Foreign Minister said Beijing remains prepared to work with Washington in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.

""China has always advocated that, as the world's largest developing country and the largest developed country, both of us bear a major responsibility for world peace and development,"" he said.

""China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation, and lose from confrontation.""

Since 2018, Washington and Beijing have been engaged in a trade war over issues such as cyber security, regulations, intellectual property, subsidies, and tariffs.

Economists warn that the ongoing trade war between the world’s two largest economies increases the risks of disrupting supply chains, curtailing investment and curbing business confidence in global markets.

More recently, the two top economies have also clashed over the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement and US support for Taiwan, which China claims full sovereignty over it.",fake

A note on data:

It's important to understand that the numbers reported by agencies and officials don't paint a complete picture of the pandemic. Many people who have COVID-19 — and no one knows how many — are not being counted by medical authorities. Because COVID-19 can have mild symptoms or even none at all, many people with the disease are unaware they have it. Others may have symptoms, but be unable to access testing near them. Finally, local governments and other organizations count and update case data differently, meaning different sources of information may show different numbers of cases.

Sometimes, data sources or formats change unexpectedly, leading to temporary inaccuracies in county-level data. We fix these as soon as possible. However, if you see a problem let us know at coronavirusdata@usatoday.com.

Twenty-one farms in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan are the recipients of grants between $400 and $12,000, to help with operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I can’t think of a more crucial time to support family farmers. As grocery shoppers see disruptions in the national food supply chain, more people are turning to local sources for their food. We know our grant program will bolster the efforts of those hardworking farmers and make more good food available in the Chicagoland area,” said Bayless in Monday’s official announcement.

More than $2.5 million in funding has been awarded to date by the foundation, one of the only grant sources to farmers, according to the official announcement.

This year’s grants will go toward a variety of farm projects/programs including the purchase of new equipment, USDA poultry processing designations, pasture fencing and other improvements.

“All of this year’s grant winners said the money will help alleviate some of the troubles facing small farms, which rely on a customer base of restaurants and farmers’ markets,” the statement said.

Bayless helms nine Chicago restaurants including Frontera Grill, Topolobampo, Xoco, Lena Brava and Cruz Blanca Brewery and Taqueria.

The patient was a Chicago man in his 40s who arrived at Weiss Memorial Hospital in “moderate to severe” condition and had not responded to other treatments, said Dr. Suzanne Pham, the hospital’s associate medical director. The patient, who had few other health issues, was close to having to be ventilated, Pham said.

“Within 24 hours of plasma infusion, [he] was able to be weaned down on his oxygen needs and was able to be discharged from the hospital within three days of that plasma infusion,” Pham said Wednesday. “So he recovered very quickly and nicely.”

The patient was discharged in mid-April, she said.

Pham said the recovery was a point of pride for a small community hospital, which has about 120 beds. On Wednesday, the hospital had about 70 coronavirus-positive patients and another 20 awaiting test results, Pham said.

The hospital was able to offer the treatment through a program led by the Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic, with the donor blood coming from the American Red Cross, Pham said. The treatment involves coronavirus patients being injected with a one-time dose of 200 milliliters of plasma.

“That plasma does have evidence of antibodies that potentially can attack the virus and hence, once transfused into a patient suffering from acute stages of illness, can help that patient recover more rapidly,” Pham said.

Three other Weiss coronavirus patients have been given the treatment, but Pham said it’s too early to say if the therapy will result in “significant benefits.”

“While convalescent plasma use remains investigational, we are cautiously optimistic that it will continue to show promise as a treatment option for our COVID-19 patients,” Pham said.

Several major local hospitals — including Rush University Medical Center and UChicago Medicine — are enrolled in trials involving the use of plasma treatment for the coronavirus. Spokespeople for each institution said Wednesday it’s too early to talk about possible success rates.

A spokeswoman for Northwestern Memorial Hospital said the hospital is also involved in a national study, but is still awaiting the availability of plasma before beginning treatment.",real

On Thursday, we learned that another 2.4 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment benefits during the previous week, and that brings the grand total for this pandemic to a whopping 38.6 million.

To get an idea of just how badly this swamps what we witnessed during the last recession, take a look at this chart.

This is the biggest spike in unemployment in all of U.S. history by a very wide margin, and analysts are expecting another huge number once again next week.

After my father got out of the U.S. Navy, he worked as a math teacher for many years, and throughout my life I have always had a deep appreciation for numbers.

And in this case, the numbers are telling us that we are facing something truly horrific.

During the month of February, the number of Americans that were currently employed peaked at 152,463,000.

If you take the 38.6 million workers that have filed for unemployment benefits during this crisis and divide it by 152,463,000, you will find that it gives you a figure of more than 25 percent.

In other words, more than one out of every four jobs in the United States is already gone, and more job losses will be coming week after week.

And of course not everyone that loses a job actually files a claim for unemployment benefits. So the true percentage of Americans that have lost a job would be even higher.

It had been hoped that the unemployment numbers would begin to normalize once states began “reopening” their economies, but so far that is not really materializing.

For example, Georgia was one of the first states to begin lifting restrictions, but that state also “now leads the country in terms of the proportion of its workforce applying for unemployment assistance”…

Georgia’s early move to start easing stay-at-home restrictions nearly a month ago has done little to stem the state’s flood of unemployment claims — illustrating how hard it is to bring jobs back while consumers are still afraid to go outside. Weekly applications for jobless benefits have remained so elevated that Georgia now leads the country in terms of the proportion of its workforce applying for unemployment assistance. A staggering 40.3 percent of the state’s workers — two out of every five — has filed for unemployment insurance payments since the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread shutdowns in mid-March, a POLITICO review of Labor Department data shows.

Our politicians really didn’t understand what they were doing when they started locking down state after state. Coming into 2020, the U.S. economy was in an extremely fragile state and was already moving rapidly toward recession territory, and now fear of COVID-19 has burst all of our economic bubbles.

The U.S. economy is now in a death spiral, and a survey that was just conducted by the Census Bureau came up with some numbers that are simply eye-popping…

Nearly half of Americans say that either their incomes have declined or they live with another adult who has lost pay through a job loss or reduced hours, the Census Bureau said in survey data released Wednesday. More than one-fifth of Americans said they had little or no confidence in their ability to pay the next month´s rent or mortgage on time, the survey found.

Already, we are beginning to see mortgage delinquencies rise to very alarming levels.

In fact, in April we witnessed the largest single month jump that has ever been recorded…

Mortgage delinquencies surged by 1.6 million in April, the largest single-month jump in history, according to a report from Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider. The data includes both homeowners past due on mortgage payments who aren’t in forbearance, along with those in forbearance plans and who didn’t make a mortgage payment in April. At 6.45%, the national delinquency rate nearly doubled from 3.06% in March, the largest single-month increase recorded, and nearly three times the prior record for a single month during the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, Black Knight said.

Sadly, the truth is that this is only going to get worse.

The “enhanced unemployment benefits” that Congress recently passed have been helping many unemployed Americans to pay their mortgages, but now it appears that President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell do not intend to extend those benefits past the July deadline. They are concerned that those benefits have been so generous that they have been discouraging many Americans from going back to work, and they are quite right about that.

Unfortunately, it isn’t just homeowners that have been missing payments.

At this point, the entire commercial real estate industry is on the precipice of a meltdown as rent payments and mortgage payments are being “skipped” all over the nation on a widespread basis. On Thursday, we learned that even the owners of The Mall of America have been skipping their mortgage payments…

The biggest shopping center in the country, The Mall of America, has missed two months of payments on its $1.4 billion mortgage, a sign of just how much retail real estate owners are reeling during the coronavirus pandemic. The mall, operated by private developers Triple Five Group, skipped mortgage payments in April and May, according to Trepp, a New York-based research firm that tracks the commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, market.

Unless Congress steps in and showers the entire commercial real estate industry with giant mountains of cash, I don’t see how an unprecedented meltdown can be averted.

It is going to be horrifying to watch, and it is going to absolutely dwarf anything that we witnessed in 2008.

Of course similar things can be said about the economy as a whole. At this point, Bank of America is projecting that U.S. GDP will fall 40 percent on an annualized basis during the second quarter of this year…

Now that banks have had a chance to evaluate the collapse in the economy in the post-covid world, a new round of GDP forecast revisions is coming, and it’s a doozy, with Bank of America spearheading the latest effort by slashing its Q2 GDP forecast from -30% to -40%. Not without a trace of irony, BofA’s chief economist Michelle Meyer writes that “words cannot describe” the loss in economic output, which is “unlike anything we have seen in modern history.”

When Bank of America starts sounding like The Economic Collapse Blog, that is a clear sign that things are really starting to fall apart in a major way.

Now that restrictions are being lifted all over the nation, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is starting to rise again, and fear of this virus is going to paralyze economic activity for the foreseeable future.

And what most Americans still don’t understand is that what we have experienced so far is just the beginning…

1182,1450,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/shakespeare-globe-theatre-coronavirus/2020/05/19/1f2fa5be-99d1-11ea-ad79-eef7cd734641_story.html,2020-05-19,Coronavirus could bring down curtain on Shakespeare's Globe Theater,"The Globe has been staging the Bard’s work at its timbered theater on the south bank of the River Thames in London since 1997, when the company opened the doors of a meticulous oak wood reproduction of the original Elizabethan playhouse that stood near the same site, until it was destroyed by fire in 1613.

Now the Globe is threatening it won’t survive the year without at least a $7 million injection of cash.



The playhouse — the brainchild of the American actor and director Sam Wanamaker — operates as a pure nonprofit, without any regular government support. It has lived “hand to mouth,” as its artistic director Michelle Terry put it, on guided tours, workshops, weddings, catering and ticket sales for packed performances of Hamlet and Macbeth, until the pandemic shut the playhouse down in March.



Shakespeare’s Globe is just one of many British cultural institutions endangered by a long lockdown. Also struggling are other independent venues, including the Old Vic, the Royal Academy and Royal Albert Hall.

The London Theatre Consortium, which represents 13 venues in the city, told Parliament that their members didn’t see any way to operate with six feet of social distancing, and warned that their stages would not be able to open immediately when a lockdown is lifted (because it takes several months to ready a performance) and that if theaters were repeatedly opened and closed to deal with ensuing waves of infection, they wouldn’t survive economically.



The outlook isn’t much better for the purely commercial theaters in the West End — the Victorian-era jewels that serve as London’s version of New York’s Broadway, staging everything from cutting-edge modern drama to long-running crowd-pleasers like “Les Misérables” and “Mama Mia!”



Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Brits that the country will ease out of lockdown very slowly — always ready to slam on the brakes if new cases begin to spike. In June, the government hopes to open some schools and retail shops. In July, sit-down restaurants may again be serving meals — as long as the outbreak continues to remain manageable.

Tourism? Not likely in the short run, as the Johnson government has said it will order travelers to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival.



Operators of theater companies, cinemas, opera houses, concert halls and night clubs in Britain assume their large-scale, indoor gathering places may be the last to reopen, perhaps not until the end of the summer. Or later.

The full-scale replica of the open-air Globe, circa 1599, is a sublime place to experience Shakespeare, but a sketchy place to be during a viral outbreak.



During a performance, half the audience sits on rows of hard benches in galleries above “the pit,” where a standing-room-only crowd of “groundlings” watch the play unfold, much as audiences did 400 years ago, shoulder-to-shoulder, often with an ale or a sausage in their hands, close enough to feel the spray from actor’s lips, who must project without the aid of microphones.



Neil Constable, chief executive of the Globe, told The Washington Post it was hard to imagine how strict social-distancing might work in any playhouse, especially one like the Globe.

He said that because the main 1,500-person venue is open to the sky, the Globe’s season runs from April through October, when it generates most of its $30 million in annual revenue.

Constable assumed most or all of the summer season might be lost — and that theaters and many hospitality venues (like pubs) might not really rebound until there is a vaccine.



This week, Parliament’s Committee of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been taking testimony from cultural institutions struggling with the lockdown.



One group, called the Theatre Trust, worried that the virus had thrown the sector into a downward spiral that would see many venues close.

The chairman of the committee, Conservative Party lawmaker Julian Knight, wrote to the government’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that “Shakespeare's Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy.”

He said, “For this national treasure to succumb to covid-19 would be a tragedy.”

In their submission to Parliament, the Globe’s directors reminded the panel that “more people engage with us about Shakespeare than anywhere else in the world,” with a million visitors a year.





The Globe management called the shutdown “financially devastating,” and said without emergency funding and the continuation of Britain’s generous Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays 85 percent government subsidizes the salaries of low to middle wage workers, “we will spend down our reserves and become insolvent.”

The BBC recalled in its report on the threat to the Globe that actors Ian McKellen, Christopher Plummer, Judi Dench, Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and David Tennant had all performed on its stage.

The Globe chief executive said he was confident people will come to Shakespeare — and to British theater. But the theaters have to survive long enough for the doors to open again.",real

Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?,"SPRINGFIELD — After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.

And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.

GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.

And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.

GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

Hoping to modify Pritzker’s plan, Republican Leader Bill Brady requested a hearing with Pritzker and Democratic lawmakers to “inquire about how they came to the conclusions in their plan.”

“I have heard members from both caucuses suggest this plan should be vetted and revised,” the Bloomington Republican wrote in a letter to Democratic Senate President Don Harmon. “I also believe this should be done in a public setting, which can be undertaken using available technology and social distancing protocols when we convene in Springfield.”

But when asked about the idea of a public hearing to hash out the Restore Illinois plan, Pritzker told reporters “it sounds like grandstanding to me.”

The Chicago Democrat said Brady should just give him a call.

“Leader Brady has my number,” Pritzker said at his daily briefing. “I’m not sure what he’s missing out on.”

“I’m very happy to have conversations with members of the opposite party and with members of the General Assembly, and I have been doing so every single day,” Pritzker said, urging Brady to call him. “I speak with him quite frequently, so there’s no lack of communication.”

Brady quickly responded to Pritzker’s dismissal of his proposed hearing as “grandstanding.”

“My caucus and I take the lives of our residents, and their livelihood, seriously,” Brady tweeted. “The public has a right to know how the decisions impacting their lives are being made. This is not about grandstanding; this is about transparency.”

It’s a recurring Republican complaint, that the Democrats are keeping them in the dark.

When the General Assembly meets next week, it will be the first time since early March. And in that time, more than one million Illinoisans have filed for unemployment benefits, and Democrats have projected the state’s budget shortfall at $6.2 billion.

But even with a return to Springfield, Republicans said they remain concerned that Democrats, who have super-majorities in both the House and Senate and control all statewide elected offices, will still leave the GOP out.

“There’s no reason why this should have taken so long,” said state Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield. “We’re a co-equal branch of government, we can convene in a safe manner.”

The Illinois House is planning to meet at the Bank of Springfield Center, while the Senate is scheduled to convene in the State Capitol. In a letter to House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, Madigan asked members of the Republican caucus to follow “precautions that we will take upon a return,” such as submitting to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks, wearing face coverings, observing social distancing and traveling and lodging in Springfield alone.

During a Zoom news conferences Thursday, Republican lawmakers said they had no problems following the health and safety guidelines, “if that’s what it takes to get us back to Springfield,” but when it came to signing a pledge they refused.

“Will I sign a pledge? There’s no need for that,” said state Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Jacksonville. “I’m a responsible adult, I don’t need to sign a pledge to Speaker Madigan so he knows what I’m going to do.”",real

The coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that Europe, particularly Germany, is running out of time to choose between the US and China.

The democratic values of the US compared to the authoritarian values of China make the choice clear.

Crises always have a habit of clarifying things. The coronavirus crisis is no different.

Once a treatment for the virus has been found, the debates about shutdown and easing restrictions have passed, and the recession has reared its ugly head, nothing less than the world order itself must be clarified. Or to be more specific: the matter of alliance. Where does Europe stand? On the side of the US or China?

Let us first look at a few assumptions and a few facts. America, the democratic world power, is currently governed by a narcissistic president — a man seen to be vulgar, uneducated, and with a volatile character who lacks any sense whatsoever for institutions. Half of Americans and three quarters of Europeans have no respect for him.

And yet, whether by accident, thanks to good advisers or a keen instinct, this president has managed to make some correct decisions. He lowered taxes to stabilize the US economy, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, supported Israel, increased pressure on Europe to show more solidarity in NATO funding, and pressured the dysfunctional WHO.

China, on the other hand, the non-democratic world power, is currently controlled by a president with a measured vanity — a man who is supposedly sensitive, highly educated and cultivated, a personality who thinks and acts with a highly consistent and long-term perspective demonstrating great sensibility for the interests of China's unitary state.

And because Xi Jinping is said to look a little like Winnie the Pooh, the bear from the eponymous children's book, Chinese censorship forbids the use of either the name or the image of Winnie Pooh. Anyone who explicitly criticizes the government is punished.

Global supremacy thanks to digital surveillance

Xi Jinping has been General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission since 2012, and President of the People's Republic of China since 2013. In 2018, he lifted all limitations on his term of office, meaning he could continue to rule China for life.

He is a politician who, more than anything else, has continued and accelerated the economic reforms that were first introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the 1970s and reached new dimensions under Jiang Zemin. And thanks to tightened digital surveillance, he has been able to push China towards a position of global dominance as part of a seemingly friendly and peaceful international expansion.

The key date of this strategy is December 11, 2001, when China was accepted as a full member of the WTO following 15 years of negotiations. A great decision for China. But perhaps the biggest mistake made in recent history by the western market economies.

Since then, the US's share in the gross world product (GWP) dropped from 20.18% in 2001 to 15.03% (2019). Europe's share dropped from 23.5% to 16.05%, a drop of 7.45 percentage points in less than two decades. While China's share increased from 7.84% to 19.24% in the same period, with an average annual growth rate of around 9%.

The big mistake was to expose democratic market economies to a non-democratic state capitalism that exploits easier trading and competitive conditions without subjecting itself to the same rules. Asymmetry instead of reciprocity was the result.

The process of ""change through trade"" actually did take place. However, not quite in the way expected by the West. China has become even more authoritarian and economically stronger, while the West has become weaker.

What is our conclusion from all this? America has clearly decided to pursue a policy of 'decoupling' from China. If Europe does not want to see its freedom subverted by Beijing, it must decide which of the two countries to ally with, and it must do so soon.

We are told time and again that it is not a case of either-or, that it's about having the best of both worlds. The opposite is true. There is no need for finely crafted rhetoric here, we need to make a fundamental political decision. China or the US. It is no longer possible to go with both. The issue has come to a head under Trump. But it is ultimately not about him.

The truth is that US policy towards China would likely not change if the Democrats were in power. The issue of China is now a bipartisan one.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not cede an inch to the US President. And yet, responding to my question at the Munich Security Conference whether she agreed in substance to Trump's China policy, she answered they had ""agreement in that regard"" to the surprise of everyone present.

Pelosi described China as a ""government that does not share our values"" and spoke of an authoritarian ""form of aggression."" Many in the room that day do business with China. It suddenly seemed a little naïve that they hoped a Democrat in the White House might be more China-friendly.

Mathias Döpfner Max Threlfall

A Democratic president might distance the US distance even further from China, despite Trump's attempts to discredit the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by accusing him of being soft on China. ""China wants Sleepy Joe soo badly"" the president cajoled on Twitter. But there is little evidence to support this.

Biden was one of the first and few international politicians to speak out against the Chinese re-education camps holding hundreds of thousands of Uighurs.

The rise of China to become a global economic power is increasingly seen as a threat to US interests. A friend of the enemy soon becomes an enemy itself. If Germany decides to expand its 5G infrastructure with Huawei, that will place an enormous strain on transatlantic relations. It would be a turning point, as America could no longer trust Germany.

The transatlantic alliance would be at risk

Washington has made it clear that there will be no cooperation on intelligence matters with the secret service of a country that allows highly sensitive data to end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.

If Washington gave up its close intelligence cooperation with Europe, this would have devastating consequences. A decoupling from the US would hit us much harder than a decoupling from China, both in terms of our economy and security.

Decoupling Germany and the US would mean relegating to the dustbin of history the alliance that helped rebuild a democratic Germany after World War II, that secured supplies to the city during the Berlin Blockade by organizing the airlift guaranteeing West Berlin's survival, and which directly and indirectly made German reunification possible.

Europe has been avoiding the alliance question for a long time, but is the time to make that decision. This does not directly have to do with the coronavirus crisis. And it certainly has nothing to do with the question of where the virus originated.

The crisis focuses the way we look at long-standing dependencies, even those in so-called vital supply chains, how we see fundamental differences in communication and crisis management, and our regard for what is ultimately a completely different concept of humanity. Employees from the Robert Koch Institute estimate that China kept the virus secret during very decisive weeks, then played it down and, by doing so, facilitated its spread worldwide.

Companies in the crisis at bargain prices

However, it is the global recession unleashed by the pandemic that has brought vital questions to a head. Should we allow the state capitalism of a totalitarian global power to continue to infiltrate or even take over key industries like banking (Deutsche Bank), automotive (Daimler, Volvo), robotics (Kuka) and trading hubs (Port of Piraeus)?

That is precisely why the alliance question must be clarified now, and fast! The current crisis is massively weakening the European economy, which could very soon place us before extremely unpleasant decisions: Should we offer our companies to China in the post-corona era for bargain prices driven downwards by economic depression? Our should we finally draw a clear line in the sand?

If we do not assert the principle of true reciprocity now — that is, China can only do here what we are allowed to do in China — then we never will. If we do not manage to assert ourselves, then Europe could suffer a similar fate to Africa, on a gradual descent towards becoming a Chinese colony.

Or, to put it in Henry Kissinger's words: If America and Europe do not manage to become a community of interest again, America will become a giant island. And the European Union will become ""an appendage of Eurasia.""

However, Europe has failed so far to clearly state where it stands, preferring to play piggy in the middle, able to tip the scales either way. Even believing its opportunism to be a sign of independence and courage. However, Europe will never be able to hold onto its position as everybody's darling. When it comes to questions of world order, you cannot have your cake and eat it.

Europe's economy likes making deals with China and does not want to be interrupted in those pursuits. Politicians are dithering. The Italians have even been willing to subjugate themselves to China's ridiculous euphemism of the ""New Silk Road.""

We increasingly hear words of admiration in Europe about the speed and efficiency of the Chinese market economy, the rigorous nature of its crisis management. All the time gladly ignoring the fact that China's successes rest on a highly perfected system of digital surveillance that translates the perversions of the KGB and Stasi into the 21st century.

Europe has two options in terms of an alliance. It can continue to expand on the traditional transatlantic alliance despite Trump, including the explicit and closer involvement of a post-Brexit UK and other allies such as Canada, Australia, Switzerland and the democratic countries of Asia. Or it can decide in favor of closer economic ties to China, bearing in mind the economic ties are always political ties as well.

If this latter path is chosen, then we might all wake up one day to find ourselves in a gruesome society, on the side of China and the states loosely associated with it — like Russia, Iran and other autocracies. A shifting world order.

Economic relations with China might seem harmless to many Europeans today, but they could soon lead to political dependence and ultimately to the end of a free and liberal Europe. The European Union has the choice. But above all Germany, Europe's economic motor, has the choice.

Should we make a pact with an authoritarian regime or should we work to strengthen a community of free, constitutionally governed market economies with liberal societies? It is remarkable that German politics, with its love of moralizing, seems to throw its values out the window when dealing with China. What is at stake here is nothing less than what kind of society we want to live in and our concept of humanity.

Germany and Europe should decide to remain with the US and pursue a strict process of decoupling from China. The exact details of this decoupling will be one of the most interesting questions of the future.

It would happen late, but not too late. It would be expensive, but not too expensive. Germany, for example, has an annual trade volume of around 200 billion euros with China. All German trade is valued at 2.4 trillion euros, so the loss of Chinese trade would be massive, but not insupportable. The coroanvirus recession is already bringing Germany to a new and devastating bottom line, but that gives us a unique opportunity to get us back on the right track.

The question as to which leader — Trump or Xi Jinping — is presented by the media as a more likeable figure is of little import in this decision. And there is no question that the American president is making it difficult for us.

But the transatlantic alliance, our community of interests and values that has grown historically over time, should be more important in the long term than our widespread frustration about the current American administration. We must concentrate on the post-Trump era. For all its weaknesses, America is still the free world's largest and most successful power.

Just as misleading are references to the fact that America also violates data protection rights, or the principles of the rule of law, that it disregards human rights and makes many other terrible mistakes. There is a difference: China has no data protection for its citizens at all, no rule of law. China has no opposition in parliament, no freedom of the press, no freedom of opinion. And China has no human rights as we understand them.

Democracy dies in darkness

When both sides make mistakes, that does not mean that the truth automatically lies somewhere in the middle. It depends on the context in which these mistakes are made, whether they can be called mistakes at all or recognized as such.

States need a suitable constitution as a self-correcting mechanism. Democracy may die in darkness, but dictatorship thrives in it. In America, people laugh at their president. Something that is forbidden in China. And the authoritarian power of the latter even stretches as far as Germany. When the Daimler Group (whose biggest single shareholder is Chinese) quoted the Dalai Lama – an enemy of the state in China – in an Instagram post, the company's CEO Dieter Zetsche had to apologize twice to the government in Beijing.

Is that Europe's future?

If current European and, above all, German policy on China continues, this will lead to a gradual decoupling from America and a step-by-step infiltration and subjugation by China.

Economic dependence will only be the first step. Political influence will follow. In the future, whoever dominates the field of artificial intelligence will dominate first economically and then politically.

At the present time, this race is between the US and China alone. China's great advantage is that it does not have any regulation as a democratic corrective. Whatever serves to strengthen the unitary Chinese state is allowed. This makes the Chinese state more unscrupulous but, more than anything, it makes it faster.

It is no small probability that Beijing will eventually overtake Silicon Valley. This is where European research excellence can become a decisive factor. On what side do we want to use it?

In the end, it is quite simple. What kind of future do we want for Europe? An alliance with an imperfect democracy or with a perfect dictatorship? It should be an easy decision for us to make. It is about more than just money. It is about our freedom, about Article 1 of Germany's Basic Law, the greatest legal term that ever existed: human dignity.",real

Supermarket shelves are empty and slaughterhouses are cesspits of disease. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains, the New York Times has proclaimed the ‘End of Meat’. Why do these people only deal in absolutes?

“Meat comes with uniquely wonderful smells and tastes,” author Jonathan Safran Foer wrote in the New York Times on Thursday, “with satisfactions that can almost feel like home itself.”

Yet, he continued, these satisfactions won’t be with us much longer. Raising livestock is bad for the environment, slaughterhouse workers are getting sick in record numbers, factory farming is cruel and inhumane, and vegetarianism is healthier and cheaper. And, because this is the New York Times, a meat-based diet is also racist, given the fact that the workers who prepare America’s steaks and sausages are overwhelmingly black and brown.

Also on rt.com Big Ag break-up? Senators target America’s meat monopolies, as virus threatens shortages

He’s right on some counts. The evils of factory farming are well-documented, and ought to horrify anyone with a shred of humanity.

Furthermore, the consolidation of America’s meatpacking industry is bad for animals and farmers alike. Four companies now handle 85 percent of all beef production in the US, and three of these firms control 63 percent of the country’s pork production.

The companies – Tyson Foods, Cargill, the Brazilian-owned JBS S.A., and the Chinese-owned Smithfield – have been criticized before for underpaying farmers and workers, and for horrific abuse at their plants.

Elite nonsense

Yet the notion that a vegetarian or vegan diet would usher in a bright new future is elite nonsense. Saying this is not ""industry propaganda,"" despite what he argues.

Factory meat is bad. Mass production of meat is bad. We need more humane agricultural. Being vegan isn't a solution. https://t.co/SRbw4fu1GD — Black Midwife 🇳🇬 (@SassyE) May 21, 2020

Not going to read ""The End of Meat is Here,"" because it's not. I live in an agricultural farming valley. We have access to locally sourced beef and poultry, direct from the farmers who raise them. Totally cool w/ factory farming going the way of the dinosaur, but meat isn't over. — Vert DuFerk 🔥🌹❤️🇺🇸 (@VertDuFerk) May 21, 2020

Safran Foer claims that adopting such a diet would be cheap. Citing a 2015 study, he claims that “a vegetarian diet is $750 a year cheaper than a meat-based diet.” What he didn’t explain is that the vegetarian diet studied by researchers was dreamed up by one of the researchers themselves in the 1990s as a weight-loss program that substituted olive oil for meat.

Meat may be murder, but an oil-based slimming diet is torture, and all but the most masochistic would gladly pay a premium to get their protein from animals.

Environmentally, the vegan future isn’t as green as its proponents like to make out. Demand for avocados, soy and palm oil has accelerated deforestation around the world. A 2016 study found that if humanity switched over to a vegan diet, we wouldn’t be able to sustain as many people, while another group of researchers caused a stir in 2018 when they found that removing livestock from fields would have “devastating” consequences on biodiversity and nutrition.

Even the Guardian, the torchbearer of all things liberal, ran a column in 2018 arguing that, “Rather than being seduced by exhortations to eat more products made from industrially grown soya, maize and grains, we should be encouraging sustainable forms of meat and dairy production based on traditional rotational systems.”

Eating meat is ‘racist’

But you should just shut up and drink the oil, you Nazi, because eating meat is racist. By continuing to demand meat, consumers are putting the “overwhelmingly brown and black” slaughterhouse workers of America at risk of catching the coronavirus, not to mention the occupational hazards that go along with working in the meat industry, Safran Foer argues.

As well as hiring America’s black underclass, the meatpacking industry depends on the labor of illegal immigrants. Nearly a third of all slaughterhouse workers are illegal immigrants who work for a third less than their American counterparts, but you won’t find the New York Times advocating for tougher border controls. That would be racist, by its own rules.

Man did not fight his way to the top of the food chain... to eat vegetables.So everybody spouting ""The End of Meat Is Here"" to tug on heartstrings while they do mental gymnastics to somehow virtue signal about “justice,” can have several seats.Now gimme some chicken! 🍗🍗🍗 — Errol Webber For Congress (CA-37) (@ErrolWebber) May 21, 2020

New York Times is promoting an article called ""The End of Meat Is Here"".The end of meat is not here. We can eat what we want. It’s a free country. — Dean Browning (R) PA-7 (@DeanBrowningPA) May 21, 2020

Instead, the paper went with its tried and true approach of shaming its white liberal readership, appealing to their overdeveloped guilt complexes. Likewise, arguing in favor of raising wages and improving welfare – incremental change – won’t grab headlines like ‘The End of Meat is Here’ does.

The dichotomy is false. Instead of choosing between industrial murder-factories and vegetarian utopia, there are several ways that America’s meat supply-line can be overhauled. First of all, the meat processing monopolies could be broken up. These firms can effectively dictate prices to farmers, ensuring that only the biggest, industrial farming operations can survive. Just last month, a pair of US senators urged the Federal Trade Commission to do just this.

Additionally, US Department of Agriculture regulations could be relaxed to allow farmers to sell their animals to small-scale local producers. At present, slaughterhouses need to have a USDA inspector on site, and only the largest facilities can afford to do this.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie wrote a bill aimed at undoing these regulations several years ago, and in light of the recent spate of slaughterhouse sicknesses, has again tried to push it through Congress.

Paying more for meat

Smaller-scale and more humane meat production would increase prices, as would new welfare legislation. However, it’s far more likely that consumers would pay more for their meat than wipe it off their plates entirely. Tough new animal welfare laws would be infinitely more palatable than a grains, beans ‘n’ oil diet.

A better world is a matter of will. While vegans will argue that all animal consumption is ethically wrong, the vast majority of the public like hamburgers, steaks and a Sunday roast.

These same people aren’t racist or classist, and likely care on some level about the welfare of animals. It shouldn’t be difficult to strike a balance.

In the meantime, a columnist telling the public “you have to stop eating animals” isn’t going to achieve anything, bar earning the Times a few more clicks.

The Hechinger Report

This story about education software was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. Sign up for the Hechinger newsletter.

Coronavirus school closures in all 50 states sent educators and parents scrambling to find online learning resources to keep kids busy and productive at home. Website traffic to the homepage for IXL, a popular tool that lets students practice skills across five subjects through online quizzes, spiked in March. Same for Matific, which gives students math practice tailored to their skill level, and Edgenuity, which develops online courses.

All three of these companies try to hook prospective users with claims on their websites about their products’ effectiveness. Matific boasts that its game-based activities are “proven to help increase results by 34 percent.” IXL says its program is “proven effective” and that research “has shown over and over that IXL produces real results.” Edgenuity boasts that the first case study in its long list of “success stories” shows how 10th grade students using its program “demonstrated more than an eightfold increase in pass rates on state math tests.”

These descriptions of education technology research may comfort educators and parents looking for ways to mitigate the effects of lost learning time because of the coronavirus. But they are all misleading.

None of the studies behind IXL’s or Matific’s research claims were designed well enough to offer reliable evidence of their products’ effectiveness, according to a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University who catalog effective educational programs. And Edgenuity’s boast takes credit for substantial test score gains that preceded the use of its online classes.

Misleading research claims are increasingly common in the world of ed tech. In 2002, federal education law began requiring schools to spend federal money only on research-based products. As more schools went online and demand for education software grew, more companies began designing and commissioning their own studies about their products. But with little accountability to make sure companies conduct quality research and describe it accurately, they’ve been free to push the limits as they try to hook principals and administrators.

This problem has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus, as widespread school closures have forced districts to turn to online learning. Many educators have been making quick decisions about what products to lean on as they try to provide remote learning options for students during school closures.

Coronavirus learning:Is online school program backed by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg the answer?

A Hechinger Report review found dozens of companies promote their products’ effectiveness on their websites, in email pitches and in vendor brochures with little evidence or shoddy backing to support their claims. Some companies are trying to gain a foothold in a crowded market. Others sell some of the most widely used education software in schools today.

Many companies claim that their products have “dramatic” and “proven” results. In some cases, they tout student growth that their own studies admit is not statistically significant. Others claim their studies found effects that independent evaluators say didn’t exist. Sometimes these companies make hyperbolic claims of effectiveness based on a kernel of truth from one study, even though the results haven’t been reproduced consistently.

The Matific study that found a 34% increase in student achievement, for instance, includes a major caveat: “It is not possible to claim whether or how much the use of Matific influenced this outcome as students would be expected to show some growth when exposed to teaching, regardless of what resources are used.”

IXL’s research simply compares state test scores in schools where more than 70% of students use their program with state test scores in other schools. This analysis ignores other initiatives happening in those schools and the characteristics of the teachers and students that might influence performance.

About those teachers... They wanted respect. It only took a coronavirus pandemic and worldwide economic collapse

Edgenuity boasts of contributing to an eightfold increase in the rate of 10th graders' passing state math tests at Altamont High School in Utah. But the claim is based on measuring growth starting two years before the school introduced Edgenuity, rather than just one year before. Over two years of actually using Edgenuity, 11th grade pass rates dropped in the featured school, ninth grade pass rates fell and then recovered, and 10th grade pass rates doubled — a significantly less impressive achievement than the one the company highlights.

Matific did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IXL declined to comment on critiques that its studies weren’t adequately designed to make conclusions about the impact of its program on student test scores. And Edgenuity agreed it shouldn’t have calculated student growth the way it did and said it would edit its case study, though at the time of publication the misleading data still topped its list of “success stories.”

More than $12 billion spent on these programs

When shoddy ed tech research leads educators to believe programs might really help their students, there are consequences for schools as well as taxpayers. Districts spent more than $12 billion on ed tech in 2019.

In some places, principals and administrators consider themselves well-equipped to assess research claims, ignore the bunk and choose promising products. But many people making the decisions are not trained in statistics or rigorous study design. They don’t have the skills to assess whether promising findings with one group of students may realistically translate to their own buildings. And, perhaps most importantly, they often don’t have the time or resources to conduct follow-up studies in their own classrooms to assess whether the products paid for with public money actually worked.

“We’re spending a ton of money,” said Kathryn Stack, who spent 27 years at the White House Office of Management and Budget and helped design grant programs that award money based on evidence of effectiveness. “There is a private-sector motive to market and falsely advertise benefits of technology, and it’s really critical that we have better information to make decisions on what our technology investments are.”

In 2006, Jefferson County Public Schools, a large Kentucky district that includes the city of Louisville, began using SuccessMaker. The Pearson product is designed to supplement reading and math instruction in kindergarten through eighth grade. Between 2009 and 2014, records provided by the district show it spent about $4.7 million on new licenses and maintenance for SuccessMaker. (It was unable to provide records about its earlier purchases.)

Typically within the district, school principals get to pick the curriculum materials used in their buildings, but sometimes purchases happen at the district level if administrators find a promising product for the entire system.

SuccessMaker, which at the time boasted on its webpage that it was “proven to work” and designed on “strong bases of both underlying and effectiveness research,” never lived up to that promise. In 2014, the district’s program evaluation department published a study on the reading program’s impact on student learning, as measured by standardized tests. The results were stark.

“When examining the data, there is a clear indication that SuccessMaker Reading is not improving student growth scores for students,” the evaluation said. “In fact, in most cases, there is a statistically significant negative impact when SuccessMaker Reading students are compared to the control group.”

The district stopped buying new licenses for the education software — but only after it had spent millions on a product that didn’t help student learning.

Students are ghosting teachers:Without in-person classes, many students have essentially gone missing, teachers say

Companies can grade their own software

That same school year, Pearson paid for a study of SuccessMaker Reading in kindergarten and first grade. The company said the study found positive effects that were statistically significant, a claim it continues to make on its website, along with this summary of the program: “SuccessMaker has over 50 years of measurable, statistically significant results. No other digital intervention program compares.”

An independent evaluator disagrees.

Robert Slavin, a Johns Hopkins professor, wanted to watchdog companies who are selling schools software to be purchased with federal money. The 2015 federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, sets guidelines for three levels of evidence that qualify as purchases: strong, moderate and promising. But companies get to decide for themselves which label best describes their studies. A year after the law passed, Slavin started Evidence for ESSA.

“Obviously, companies are very eager to have their products be recognized as meeting ‘ESSA Strong,’” Slavin said, adding that his group is trying to fill a role he hopes the government will ultimately take on. “We’re doing this because if we weren’t, nobody would be doing it.”

Slavin’s organization tries to fill the gap by offering schools an independent assessment of the research that companies offer up for their products.

When Slavin’s team reviewed SuccessMaker research, they found that well-designed studies of the education software found no significant positive outcomes.

Slavin said Pearson contested the Evidence for ESSA determination, but a follow-up review by his team returned the same result. “We’ve been back and forth and back and forth with this, but there really was no question,” Slavin said.

Pearson stands behind its findings. “Our conclusion that these intervention programs meet the strong evidence criteria … is based on gold-standard research studies — conducted by an independent third-party evaluator — that found both SuccessMaker Reading and Math produced statistically significant and positive effects on student outcomes,” the company said in a statement.

Yet SuccessMaker also hasn’t fared well when judged by another evaluator, the federally funded and operated What Works Clearinghouse.

Launched in 2002, the What Works Clearinghouse assesses the quality of research about education products and programs. It first did a review of SuccessMaker Reading in 2009 and updated it in 2015. The ultimate conclusion: The only Pearson study of the program that met What Works’ threshold for research design showed the program has “no discernible effects” on fifth and seventh graders’ reading comprehension or fluency. (The Pearson study included positive findings for third graders that What Works did not evaluate.)

The Hechinger review of dozens of companies identified seven instances of companies giving themselves a better ESSA rating than Slavin’s site and four examples of companies claiming to have research-based evidence of their effectiveness when What Works said they did not. Two other companies tied their products to What Works’ high standards without noting that the organization had not endorsed their research.

Online school is hard enough:Now imagine you're still learning to speak English

'There isn't a ton of great evidence'

Despite almost 20 years of government attempts to focus on education research, “we’re still in a place where there isn’t a ton of great evidence about what works in education technology,"" said Stack, the former Office of Management and Budget employee. ""There’s more evidence of what doesn’t work.”

In fact, out of 10,654 studies included in the What Works Clearinghouse in mid-April, only 188 — less than 2% — concluded that a product had strong or moderate evidence of effectiveness.

Part of the problem is that good ed tech research is difficult to do and takes a lot of time in a quickly moving landscape. Companies need to convince districts to participate. Then they have to provide them with enough support to make sure a product is used correctly, but not so much that they unduly influence the final results. They must also find (and often pay) good researchers to conduct a study.

When results make a company’s product look good, there’s little incentive to question them, said Ryan Baker, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “A lot of these companies, it’s a matter of life or death if they get some evidence up on their page,” he said. “No one is trying to be deceitful. (They’re) all kind of out of their depth and all trying to do it cheaply and quickly.”

Many educators have begun to consider it their responsibility to dig deeper than the research claims companies make. In Kentucky's Jefferson County, for instance, administrators have changed their approach to picking education software, in part because of pressure from state and federal agencies.

Felicia Cumings Smith, the assistant superintendent for academic services in Jefferson, joined the district two years ago, after working in the state department of education and at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (The Gates Foundation is one of the many funders of The Hechinger Report and is a partial funder of USA TODAY's education team.) Throughout her career, she has pushed school and district officials to be smart consumers in the market for education software and technologies. At Jefferson, she said things have changed since the district stopped using SuccessMaker. The current practice is to find products that have a proven track record of success with similar student populations.

“People were just selecting programs that didn’t match the children that were sitting in front of them or have any evidence that it would work for the children sitting in front of them,” Cumings Smith said.

Jefferson County, one of the 35 largest districts in the country, is fortunate to have an internal evaluation department to monitor the effectiveness of products it adopts. Many districts can’t afford that. And even in Jefferson, the programs that individual principals choose to bring into their schools get little follow-up evaluation.

A handful of organizations have begun to help schools conduct their own research. Project Evident, Results for America and the Proving Ground all support efforts by schools and districts to study the impact of a given product on their own students’ performance. The ASSISTments E-TRIALS project lets teachers perform independent studies in their classrooms. This practice helps educators better understand if products that seem to work elsewhere are working in their own schools. But these efforts reach relatively few schools nationwide.

Some people say educators shouldn’t shoulder the full responsibility of figuring out what works. Vendors, they say, should be held to higher standards of truthfulness in the claims they make about their products.

The Food and Drug Administration, after all, sets limits to what drug and supplement manufacturers can say about their products. So far, ed tech companies have no such watchdog.

Sudden school closures have only complicated the problem, as educators rushed to find online options for students at home. “This is such a crisis that people are, quite understandably, throwing into the gap whatever they have available and feel comfortable using,” Slavin said.

Online testing has problems, too:Online AP exam issues prompt College Board to offer email option. It's too late for thousands of students who will have to test again.

Still, Slavin sees an opportunity in the chaos. Educators can use the next several months to examine ed tech research and be ready to use proven strategies — whether they’re education software or not — when schools do reopen, ultimately making them savvier consumers.

“Students will catch up, and schools will have a taste of what proven programs can do for them,” he said. “At least, that is my hope.”",real

Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of Chechnya, who, according to unconfirmed reports, was hospitalized after he had his lungs deteriorated as a result of the coronavirus infection, is in serious condition.

According to unnamed sources, doctors believe that Kadyrov contracted the coronavirus infection about two or three weeks ago. A week after, his health condition deteriorated, although he believed that it was common cold. Soon afterwards, he was hospitalized to one of the best clinics in Moscow. Reports about his hospitalization appeared on May 21, although representatives of the Chechen administration have not released any official comments on the subject.

Reportedly, Kadyrov started complaining of first symptoms a few days ago, but attributed his ailment to a common respiratory infection. His condition began to deteriorate rapidly, and Chechen doctors advised he should contact Moscow hospitals.



Until recently, Ramzan Kadyrov, led a normal life and did not follow any precautions recommended in connection with the rapid spread of coronavirus. He was holding daily meetings with members of his administration and traveling around the republic. It was reported that he went to a remote area of the republic to release nursery-grown mountain goats into the wild.



At the same time, Chechnya implemented strict quarantine measures in mid-April. Free movement was permitted only for medical personnel, employees of road, communal and emergency services, as well as for those who have special passes.



The president of Chechnya offered to send those who violate lockdown measures to agricultural works. ""He didn't want to stay home so he went outside? Well, let him work all day in the field and bring good. We will find work for him. Let him plow the fields, sow and grow,"" said Ramzan Kadyrov.



On April 29, Kadyrov ordered to tighten control over the movement of people. Quarantine violators will be deprived of their vehicles and forced to clean the streets, he said. Local residents criticized the tight control of security officials over those who go outside.



According to the regional Ministry of Health, as many as 1005 cases of coronavirus infection have been registered in Chechnya. 620 people recovered, 11 died. Among the infected, there are 92 physicians.",fake
1209,1876,http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/05/23/625944/US-cities-San-Francisco-homeless-tent-encampments-coronavirus-,2020-05-23,San Francisco sanctions once-shunned homeless encampments,"San Francisco is joining other US cities in authorizing homeless tent encampments in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a move officials have long resisted but are now reluctantly embracing to safeguard homeless people.

About 80 tents are now neatly spaced out on a wide street near San Francisco City Hall as part of a ""safe sleeping village"" opened last week. The area between the city's central library and its Asian Art Museum is fenced off to outsiders, monitored around the clock and provides meals, showers, clean water and trash pickup.

In announcing the encampment, and a second one to open in the famed Haight-Ashbury neighborhood, San Francisco's mayor acknowledged that she didn't want to approve tents, but having unregulated tents mushroom on sidewalks was neither safe nor fair.

""So while in normal times I would say that we should focus on bringing people inside and not sanctioning tent encampments, we frankly do not have many other options right now,"" she said in a tweet last week.

Nicholas Woodward, 37, is camping at the safe sleeping site, but he said he preferred sleeping in his tent before the city stepped in; he finds the fencing belittling and the rules too controlling. His friend, Nathan Rice, 32, said he'd much rather have a hotel room than a tent on a sidewalk, even if the city is providing clean water and food.

""I hear it on the news, hear it from people here that they're going to be getting us hotel rooms,"" he said. ""That's what we want, you know, to be safe inside.""

San Francisco has moved 1,300 homeless people into hotel rooms and RVs as part of a statewide program to shelter vulnerable people but the mayor has been criticized for moving too slowly. She has said she is not inclined to move all the city's estimated 8,000 homeless into hotels, despite complaints from advocates who say overcrowded tents are a public health disaster.

San Francisco is just the latest city to authorize encampments as shelters across the country move to thin bed counts so homeless people, who are particularly susceptible to the virus due to poor health, have more room to keep apart.

Santa Rosa in Sonoma County welcomed people this week to its first managed encampment with roughly 70 blue tents. Portland, Oregon, has three homeless camps with city-provided sleeping bags and tents, and Maricopa County opened two parking lots to homeless campers in Phoenix.

San Francisco officials have historically frowned upon mini tent cities and routinely rounded up tents on city streets. But with an estimated 150,000 homeless people in California, most of them living out in the open, it's impossible to stamp out the highly visible tents along highways and on crowded urban sidewalks.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that officials not disturb tent encampments during the coronavirus pandemic unless people are given individual hotel rooms, as homeless advocates want to see. Those advocates say providing a safe space where people can get meals, use a toilet and avoid harassing passers-by is a reasonable option given the times.

""The best, best option would be housing. The second-best option would be hotel rooms, but if you can't do that and we're going to have so many people outside then I think it makes sense ... to make those outside as safe as can be,"" said Dr. Margot Kushel, director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.

But Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the federal government is providing an astonishing amount of money to battle the pandemic and she hopes cities and counties use it to put people into empty hotels, motels and other unused places.

""It's almost like we're giving ourselves permission that it's OK that people will sleep outside, and once we've given ourselves that permission, it's very difficult to get the initiative together to do otherwise,"" she said.

Still, government-sanctioned tent camps may be here to stay, at least until a coronavirus vaccine is distributed.

At the urging of San Francisco Supervisor Sandra Lee Fewer, the city's parks and real estate departments are compiling an inventory of open spaces that might be suitable for tent camps. She said sidewalk space is a coveted commodity for retailers, given coronavirus restrictions, and the city's strategy of adding more shelter beds doesn't make sense with a contagious virus.

""It is just a new world that we're living in,"" she said, ""and it's going to have to be our new normal.""

China is now testing millions of people to catch new infections. South Korea has dispatched several thousand police officers in a renewed push for contact tracing.

Russia, meanwhile, is still facing its first wave. With more than 10,000 new cases reported each day, the country has the second-highest number of confirmed infections in the world, trailing only the U.S.

Sweden's COVID-19 strategy leads to higher fatality rate than U.S.

The city where it all started, Wuhan, China, is on alert again. Over the next 10 days, authorities in China's coronavirus epicenter are testing every one of its 11 million residents after six new coronavirus cases were reported over the weekend.

Those were the first positive tests in Wuhan in 35 days, since the city celebrated the lifting of a 76-day lockdown on April 8.

In neighboring South Korea, authorities in the capital city of Seoul have ordered more than 2,000 clubs and bars to close again after a new cluster of more than 100 COVID-19 cases was traced to the popular entertainment district of Itaewon.

A gay man in his 20's, who later tested positive for the virus, is believed to have visited several clubs there.

More than 8,000 police have reportedly been deployed in Seoul to trace almost 11,000 people who were in the area, using mobile phone data and credit card transactions.

""If the government of Korea hadn't done this, then there would be 119 people out there infecting other people. So that actually gets to the point of tracing people,"" explained Dr. Jerome Kim, a leading epidemiologist in the country.

In Russia, meanwhile, there's been more tragedy on top of the still-mounting infections. A fire at a hospital in St. Petersburg killed at least four coronavirus patients this week — the second deadly blaze in just four days linked preliminarily to ventilator machines.

Senators are expected to grill Mnuchin and Powell about actions still needed to keep the world's largest economy afloat and about missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far. (See graphic here showing how the money moved.)

As more states reopen businesses, the government is closing in on the end of an eight-week program to funnel money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, prompting calls to extend the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program. President Donald Trump said on Monday that such an extension “should be easy.”

Other programs aimed at helping larger companies and municipal bond issuers through a sharp recession are just getting started, and Powell and Mnuchin may provide details on their application at the hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).

Powell said in prepared remarks for the hearing released on Monday that the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was “critical” to the U.S. central bank’s ability to expand credit throughout the economy to offset the blow from the coronavirus.

In remarks broadcast on Sunday night, Powell said unemployment may hit 25% before it begins to fall, with a contraction in gross domestic product of 20% or more. He added that positive “medical metrics” that can build consumer confidence would be critical.

Senators are also likely to try to elicit the two officials’ views on another $3 trillion aid bill crafted by House of Representatives Democrats that narrowly passed that chamber on Friday. The measure is opposed by Senate Republicans as negotiations continue between the two parties and the Trump administration.

Before the hearing, Mnuchin is scheduled to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.

Mnuchin also will face questions by the Senate banking panel over processing glitches that held up small-business loan applications as the Paycheck Protection Program was rushed into service in early April, as well as on abrupt policy changes that required many larger, publicly traded restaurant chains with access to capital markets to return their funds under the threat of audits.

A separate congressional oversight board issued its first report here on the response, consisting largely of questions that could be asked in Tuesday's hearing.

Among them are how the agencies will measure success and isolate the effects of the measures from other state and federal efforts.",real

At this point, a number of states have begun lifting stay-at-home orders and allowing nonessential businesses to reopen, with the hope that they can start thawing their economies even if the coronavirus hasn’t been fully contained.

But the defrosting process seems to be going slowly—at least if you judge by the number of people brave enough to eat out. At restaurants that use OpenTable’s booking software, the number of diners in every state where the company tracks data was still down by 82 percent or more through Sunday, compared with a year before. That includes early reopeners like Georgia (down 92 percent), Utah (down 91 percent), Nebraska (down 90 percent), South Carolina (down 89 percent), Tennessee (down 87 percent), Texas (down 83 percent), and Oklahoma (down 82 percent).

Jordan Weissmann/Slate

There are a few reasons restaurant bookings are worth paying special attention to at the moment. For starters, the food and beverage industry alone lost more than 5 million jobs last month, and until it rebounds, the wider labor market won’t get back to full health either. Dining out is also a good bellwether for people’s willingness to live regular lives in which they spend extended periods of time indoors around other living, breathing human beings. If what we’re seeing in Texas, Georgia, and elsewhere is any hint, we’re headed for a gradual return to normalcy, not an instant, V-shaped bounce-back.

Not every restaurant in America uses OpenTable. But its data might be the best real-time source of information we have on the industry. It tracks sit-down diners—including people who make online and phone reservations, or just walk in—at a sample of 20,000 restaurants that provide the company with information on all of their openings. During the early stages of the crisis, OpenTable’s numbers were a useful leading indicator that warned economists and journalists about how COVID-19 was convulsing the economy: The industry crash it picked up in real time during March foreshadowed a wider, national decline in consumer spending and small-business revenue that followed about a week later, as Harvard’s Opportunity Insights project has since documented.

The slightly glib way to sum up OpenTable’s numbers is that, at this point, Americans clearly don’t think it’s worth dying for a decent plate of pasta. But there are some important nuances to keep in mind.

One important reason that restaurants aren’t full yet in states that have started reopening is that, well, they’re not allowed to be. In Georgia, dining places are only allowed to seat 10 patrons per 500 square feet. In Texas, they can only operate at 25 percent capacity in counties that have recently had more than five coronavirus cases; in Tennessee they’re limited to half-capacity. Many restaurants have chosen not to open at all due to these restrictions, because they don’t think it will be profitable. Or they’re just sticking to takeout.

Meanwhile, some states are opening in stages, so all of their restaurants haven’t necessarily had a chance to welcome guests. In Tennessee, dining rooms started opening back up on May 1. But Nashville only joined in on Monday. In Florida, restaurant attendance is likely still down 89 percent because stay-at-home orders remain in place for the massive Miami and Palm Beach areas. (Which is why I didn’t include Florida on the graph above.)

All that really tells us, however, is that under any realistic plan to reopen a state, restaurants won’t see an instant recovery, which means that—unless we want our future dining options to be limited to Olive Garden and Buffalo Wild Wings—they will likely need more government aid sometime soon. Also, it seems pretty obvious that lots of residents in these states are still worried that eating out will get them sick.

This is bad news for Republicans in Congress and the White House, who seem to be betting that they can engineer a quick economic recovery in time for November’s elections without passing another big round of relief spending, much less having a coronavirus vaccine or treatment (or much of a federal pandemic response whatsoever). Instead, they’re urging states to reopen for business whether the coronavirus has been properly contained or not. This plan has always seemed doomed to failure. Every bit of data we have, from OpenTable’s numbers to consumer spending figures to mobility data, tells us that Americans started staying home and the economy began folding in on itself before governors started ordering shops and restaurants closed and telling people to stay put at home. As more formal economic analyses are already confirming, state responses didn’t cause the economy to collapse. Fear of the virus did. And until people feel safe again, they aren’t going to do things like go out to eat.

1251,1572,https://www.politico.eu/article/most-americans-say-germans-tackled-coronavirus-better-than-us-report/,2020-05-20,Most Americans say Germans tackled coronavirus better than US: report,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

​The collection is being sold by East Bristol Auction and is expected to fetch thousands of pounds.

“This was real espionage work - secret meetings, coded messages, real cloak-and-dagger stuff. A big part of the SOE was sending secret items to troops in occupied territories. Useful items like maps, compasses and even secret orders - anything to help them escape or evade capture. Very often these items were 'everyday' items that were sent in aid packages to camps, and the way items were secreted was very often ingenious. German prison camp officials wouldn't think twice that an innocent set of dominos could do harm, but how wrong they were. You can almost picture some RAF officers in their hut pulling apart these dominos and planning their escape. It's incredible stuff, both frightening and exhilarating at the same time,” says auctioneer Andrew Stowe.

While using the birds to ferry explosives was once considered, the plan was never put into practice.

“All of these items are very special. They highlight not only the ingenuity of the time, but also the desperation. Can you imagine being trapped in the middle of France during the war, and the only tools you have to aid you getting home safely are a map on the back of a domino, and a compass from your razor blade? Terrifying. But it worked. People successfully made it back to Britain because of these items. These objects saved lives. It's really humbling - and a perfect example of finding little ways to help those in need. They are quintessentially British,” Stowe concludes.

Republicans say they're moving ahead with plans to gather tens of thousands of people at their presidential nominating convention in North Carolina this summer — even as Democrats weigh their options for convening during the coronavirus pandemic.

In a statement Saturday marking 100 days to go before the 2020 Republican National Convention, the Republican National Committee said it is expecting nearly 50,000 attendees, including delegates and members of the media, at the convention scheduled for the week of Aug. 24 in Charlotte.

And in an op-ed published Friday for Fox Business, convention President and CEO Marcia Lee Kelly said Republicans are preparing to gather ""thousands"" to mark the formal renomination of President Trump and Vice President Pence to lead the party's 2020 ticket. She said organizers are working on details including the carpet and lighting at the convention.

Kelly said convention planners have ""recognized that large-scale events would need to look different in light of COVID-19.""

Kelly did not specify how the convention would be different because of the virus, though she told Fox that organizers would follow guidelines from federal, state and local authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She noted that the RNC has hired Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge — a physician, former medical director for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and former chairman of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — to oversee health and safety planning for the convention.

In an interview with NPR member station WFAE on Thursday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the RNC is committed to holding the convention in Charlotte, while adding that it's possible attendees may wear masks or hold some events in smaller venues or outside.

City leaders in Charlotte have been divided over how to move forward with convention planning given the public health threat. Some city council members in the heavily Democratic community have expressed fears that gathering thousands of people in a relatively small area could prompt a surge in COVID-19 cases. The city remains under a stay-at-home order and has limited mass gatherings to no more than 10 people.

And some Republicans, including North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, have cast doubt on the feasibility of moving ahead as planned. Tillis has said that hosting the party's convention could be ""very difficult"" under these circumstances.

In an interview this week with the Washington Examiner, Trump reiterated his determination to hold the convention, saying, ""I think we'll be in good shape by that time."" However, the president said he was concerned about the possibility of North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, ""playing politics"" with the convention. Cooper is running for reelection this year and, like every governor, is charged with making decisions about how quickly to reopen the state during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Democrats have delayed the Democratic National Convention, originally planned for the week of July 13 in Milwaukee, pushing it back to the week of Aug. 17 — one week prior to the RNC. Party leaders have been exploring options for safely holding an event where former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to be officially named the party's nominee amidst the pandemic.

Democrats have already taken steps to allow delegates to participate remotely and are exploring other contingency plans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tossed out suggestions that include shortening the convention or spacing out attendees in a ""gigantic stadium.""

In an interview with NPR, the Democratic convention's chief executive, Joe Solmonese, said it's too soon for organizers to know exactly how plans will need to be adjusted because of the virus.

""How many people we do that in front of, how many hotel rooms we occupy in the city of Milwaukee, how many buses and what sort of security infrastructure we end up having in terms of the uncertainty of the public health environment remains to be seen,"" Solmonese said.",real
1264,1210,https://www.businessinsider.com/nowhere-close-to-herd-immunity-for-coronavirus-2020-5,2020-05-16,No place on Earth is anywhere close to herd immunity for the coronavirus,"Countries hit hard by the coronavirus, like Spain, France, and the US, are finding that even devastating waves of coronavirus infections haven't gotten their populations anywhere near the threshold of herd immunity.

An estimated 5% of these countries' populations have coronavirus antibodies — a far cry from the 50-70% required to stop the virus's spread.

Experts warn against a ""very brutal arithmetic"" that sacrifices lives for the goal of herd immunity.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

As more coronavirus antibody tests roll out across the globe, it's becoming increasingly clear that no place is anywhere near the distant, bright horizon of ""herd immunity.""

Populations achieve that benchmark when enough people become infected and recover — thereby developing pathogen-fighting antibodies — to prevent the virus from spreading. For COVID-19, experts estimate the threshold for herd immunity may be as high as 70% of the population.

So far, the first wave of infections has left more than 300,000 people dead worldwide and devastated the global economy. But even the hardest-hit countries are finding that scarcely 10% of their populations have walked away with antibodies.

Tens of thousands are dead, but only 5% of the population may be immune

This week, studies in Spain and France suggested that no more than 5% of those populations have developed COVID-19 antibodies. Each country has reported more than 27,000 deaths from the virus as of Thursday.

Spain's evidence shows that ""large outbreaks and excess mortality do NOT produce meaningful herd immunity,"" William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard, said on Twitter.

In the US, where nearly 85,000 people have died, the prospects for mass immunity are no better. In April, a study in Santa Clara County, California, estimated that between 2.5% and 4.2% of residents there had antibodies. A study of Los Angeles County made a similar estimate: 2.8% to 5.6% ""seroprevalence"" (the term for the percentage of people who have antibodies in their blood).

A New York antibody study found that 13.9% of New York state residents had been infected with the coronavirus. In New York City, seroprevalence was as high 21.2% — but that was among people who sought out tests (meaning they might have thought they had symptoms). That's still a far cry from the 50-70% required for herd immunity.

That doesn't bode well for other parts of the US, which haven't yet faced devastating waves of infections like the one that killed more than 27,500 people in New York.

""In the US, I estimate there is no more than ~5% seroprevalence,"" Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at University of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ""I don't see any realistic way to reach any [herd immunity] threshold without many, many more deaths.""

'Humans are not herds'

Even Sweden, which has largely allowed life to continue as normal since the beginning of the pandemic, seems nowhere near herd immunity.

Sweden's own public health agency has estimated that, at best, about a quarter of the population of Stockholm might have contracted COVID-19. Over 3,500 people have died in the country — more than 12% of its confirmed cases.

""This idea that, 'well, maybe countries who had lax measures and haven't done anything will all of a sudden magically reach some herd immunity, and so what if we lose a few old people along the way?' This is a really dangerous, dangerous calculation,"" Mike Ryan, executive director of health emergencies at the World Health Organization, said on a call with reporters on Monday.

""Humans are not herds,"" Ryan added. ""I think we need to be really careful when we use terms in this way around natural infections in humans, because it can lead to a very brutal arithmetic which does not put people and life and suffering at the center of that equation.""

Vaccines are the best way to build herd immunity

Eventually, communities or countries could achieve herd immunity through vaccination. But experts say the world should plan to get through the next two years of COVID-19 without it.

Until a vaccine becomes widely available, experts recommend closely monitoring the virus through widespread testing and contact tracing, then isolating infected people and anyone with whom they came into contact. Governments may also need to re-close businesses and put restrictions back into place if infections threaten to surpass local hospital capacities again.

""A very low proportion of the people that have been tested have evidence of antibodies,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said at a press conference on Monday. ""We have a long way to go with this virus, because the virus has more people that can be infected.""

Ulster County officials are now recommending anyone who received a haircut from the barber in the past three weeks should seek a coronavirus test.

Under Governor Andrew Cuomo's ""New York Pause"" policy, barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons and other personal hygiene services have been ordered closed to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

In the notice, Ulster County Health Commissioner Dr. Carol Smith did not identify the barber by name, but said the shop was located on Broadway in Kingston, New York.

""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease,"" Smith said in the notice. ""Learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening.""

""As much as we would all like to go out and get a professional haircut, this kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" she continued.

Smith urged anyone who received a haircut from a Kingston barber in the last few weeks to immediately contact their doctor or call the Ulster County COVID hotline at (845) 443-8888 to get tested for coronavirus.

The notice says there have been 1,533 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 62 deaths in Ulster County, which is located about 100 miles north of New York City.

Governor Cuomo spoke about the case during his Friday news briefing and said the barber was responsible for infecting other people.

""Barber in Kingston was operating in defiance of the close order, infected I think over a dozen people,"" Cuomo said. ""You know, that is a occupation of close proximity, right? You can't really socially distance and do a haircut … that is by definition an up-close-and-personal occupation.""

Cuomo said reopening barbershops and hair salons won't come until Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan, along with retail stores and other types of professional services, after health benchmarks are met.

This barber is only the latest small business owner in the country to make headlines for defying orders to close shop. Although the closure of non-essential businesses is seen by health officials as an effective measure to slow the spread of the virus and save lives, some residents argue it is not worth the financial burden.

In Texas, a salon owner was arrested earlier this month for ignoring cease and desist orders. Shelley Luther, who violated a stay-at-home order by keeping her Dallas-area salon open, was sentenced to jail time. A few days later, Texas Governor Greg Abbott modified his COVID-19 executive orders, effectively setting Luther free.

Similar incidents have occurred in other states, and groups of demonstrators have gathered in Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado and elsewhere to protest stay-a-home orders.

Many states have now begun loosening stay-at-home orders and opening up, including parts of New York, which will open by region and in phases depending on health conditions in each region.

Of the 10 regions in New York, five have met all seven metrics to begin Phase 1 of reopening Friday, May 15: Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North Country and the Southern Tier. Phase 1 will allow construction, agriculture, hunting and fishing, manufacturing, and curbside pick-up retail operations to resume.

Local reports say Ulster County, where the barber shop is located, has met the benchmarks to reopen, but the Hudson Valley region where it's located has not, so non-essential businesses there will remain closed under state orders for now.",real

Have you, like many others, been wondering if it was COVID-19? “I get emails every day,” says George Rutherford, a University of California San Francisco epidemiologist. They say things like, “I think I might have had it. I really want to know,” he says.

Maybe you’ve been tempted by the wave of antibody tests that recently hit the market — but don’t think that just because you can buy a test, it will be accurate.

There are lots of tests available, but it’s not entirely clear which ones are best. Tests can go wrong in several places: by choosing the wrong proteins to look for, by using the wrong chemicals in the test itself, or by making the test badly. For instance, the UK paid $20 million for antibody tests that didn’t work.

“It’s kind of like the wild West.”

The US Food and Drug Administration allowed test makers to market their antibody tests, even if they hadn’t undergone review by the agency. The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) has raised concerns about this: “We now have at least 90 tests on the market, and we don’t know about the accuracy of the results,” Kelly Wroblewski, APHL’s director of infectious disease programs, told USA Today.

“It’s kind of like the wild West,” says Janko Nikolich-Zugich, the head of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Tucson’s department of immunobiology. One of the reasons the University of Arizona wound up making its own antibody test was because it wasn’t clear how reliable other ones might be, he says.

“It’s very attractive to think about, ‘I’m going to go to a drive-through and get a finger prick and I’ll get an answer,’” says Patricia Slev, the section chief for immunology at ARUP Laboratories, a national reference lab. But most of these rapid tests don’t have independent validation that the test works the way the manufacturer says. Consumers who want to make sure they’re getting good antibody tests should look for ones that have outside testing to confirm the test is accurate.

That relaxed policy has since been revised. On May 4th, the FDA said that if test makers didn’t submit data showing their accuracy within 10 days, the agency would yank the tests from the market. “We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans’ anxiety,” the FDA statement read.

“If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

Several labs, including Slev’s ARUP, are now doing independent validation of antibody tests. Already, there are some early results: a manuscript that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed or published from a group of scientists led by the University of California San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley. Only three of the 14 tests the group evaluated were reliable. Four of the tests had false positive rates that ranged from 11 to 16 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told The New York Times. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”

“I am waiting for the ultimate good test,” says Robert Gallo, the co-founder and director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University School of Medicine and the co-founder of the Global Virus Network. Gallo helped develop the antibody test for HIV.

And if you’ve been pinning your hopes for getting back to normal on antibody testing that would “certify” people as safe to work or travel if they’ve already been sick, I have bad news: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned against “immunity passports.” Even if the tests were 100 percent accurate, we still don’t know whether antibodies to the new coronavirus will protect people from being reinfected. If they do confer protection, we don’t know whether it’s full or partial or how long it’ll last. Even skipping the process questions — What authority would issue these, and to whom? — this seems like a bad idea.

Chile is preparing to put out “release certificates” for people who’ve recovered from COVID-19, despite the WHO’s warning. Other countries, such as the UK, have also expressed an interest — as has Los Angeles’ mayor.

Some experts have expressed concerns that people will rush to get “immunity passports” without understanding the limitations of antibody testing. “What I worry about is that employers will misuse this,” Rutherford says. It may be true that accurate antibody testing could let us know who’s protected from COVID-19, but that hasn’t been proven yet, Rutherford says.

To understand why these tests may not be the solution everyone’s hoping for, I spoke to some experts about how antibodies work, why false positives are important, and what real uses for antibody testing might be.

What is an antibody test?

An antibody test is a way of seeing if a person’s immune system has responded to something. In the case of COVID-19, it’s a way of seeing who’s had the new coronavirus, which is different from the tests used to diagnose the illness. Though antibody tests can be used to diagnose diseases, in the case of COVID-19, they’re not very helpful for diagnoses. That’s because people don’t make antibodies to fight off the virus until at least a week — or even two weeks — after showing symptoms. Tests used for diagnosis look for virus fragments and can spot infections much earlier.

How do antibodies work?

Antibodies are part of how your body responds to threats: viruses, bacteria, and other things the body decides are harmful. Imagine someone coughs on you and infects you with the new coronavirus. The virus can’t reproduce on its own, so it invades your cells to make copies of itself. Eventually, your immune system cottons on. Here’s what happens:

⤷ Some specialized immune cells shred the virus and present its fragments to a kind of white blood cell called a B cell.

⤷ When the fragments hit the B cell, it clones itself and transforms into an antibody factory.

⤷ The antibodies the B cell creates are then released into the bloodstream.

⤷ The antibodies vary in quality: some may glom on to the virus and inactivate it.

⤷ Some may stick to the virus and signal other immune cells to come kill the virus.

⤷ Some will do nothing. And sometimes, antibodies can make things worse. How effective antibodies are will vary by person and disease.

In HIV, for instance, antibodies are just a marker of infection. Because the virus attacks the immune system, the antibodies don’t do a great job of fighting off the virus, says Rutherford. The majority of antibodies for most illnesses are neither good nor bad for you, says Gallo. They’re just a marker that you’ve been exposed to an illness. “A good majority of them are irrelevant for protection of you, and irrelevant for how the disease is progressing,” Gallo says.

It’s also possible that they can inactivate the virus — for instance, by gumming up the spike the virus uses to insert itself into your cells; these antibodies are called “neutralizing antibodies” and are the most important kind for protection. They “are what you need for vaccines to work,” says Rutherford. If we do produce neutralizing antibodies when we’re infected by the new coronavirus, it might be possible to pick one that works really well and make a version in labs that can be used to treat the illness.

It’s possible to test for neutralizing antibodies, but it’s expensive and difficult to do at a mass scale. “It’s a very labor-intensive laboratory thing,” Rutherford says. The commercially available tests don’t do this. Most of them just give people a “yes” or “no” on whether the antibodies exist.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19

Neutralizing antibodies aren’t the only way antibodies might help us, Gallo says. Some antibodies serve as signal flares by grabbing on to a different part of the virus and alerting the immune system’s killer cells. But in some cases, such as dengue, antibodies can actually make a later infection worse.

Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear what antibodies do in COVID-19. For instance, the prevalence of antibodies doesn’t mean that the amount of virus in a person’s system declines, according to a study of German patients. And the less virus in your body, the better.

If I have antibodies to the new coronavirus, does that mean I won’t get sick again?

We don’t know. The virus is too new. The question of reinfection is “an unknown,” according to Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies programs.

Some Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese patients who left the hospital after testing negative for the virus were later readmitted and tested positive for the virus again. We don’t yet know why, but other coronaviruses usually can’t reinfect people for months or even years. It’s possible that this is the result of false negatives on their tests. It’s also possible that people continue to excrete viral fragments that show up in testing after the disease has passed. Rectal swabs and stool culture remain positive for about a month, “and that has nothing to do with transmission,” Rutherford says. “It’s just pieces of digested virus.”

An early draft of an article supports the idea that these patients weren’t reinfected. Chinese scientists infected two rhesus monkeys with COVID-19, then let them recover. Thirty days later, the scientists tried to infect the monkeys again. The monkeys didn’t get sick a second time. This article hasn’t been finalized, though; it’s been posted to let other scientists critique it. The final version may change.

There are some encouraging signs that antibodies may confer protection. One is serum therapy where parts of the blood that include antibodies are spun out from survivors of COVID-19 infections and given to people who are sick. In a study of 10 patients, being given survivors’ serum “significantly improved” those patients’ symptoms. That study is too small to be definitive, but it does suggest that larger trials of serum therapy might be a good idea.

Does it matter how many antibodies you have?

Again, we don’t know. It’s still too early to know what might serve as signposts for protection. It’s also too early to know what level of antibodies might signal a person who’s recovered from COVID-19 would be a good serum donor.

The total amount of antibodies to COVID-19 in patients’ blood varies widely, according to an early report from Fudan University in Shanghai. (The paper was also put online for the research community to comment on and is not yet finalized.) Younger patients had fewer antibodies, and in 10 young patients who’d tested positive for the virus and then recovered, researchers didn’t detect any neutralizing antibodies at all. About a third of patients showed low levels of antibodies. It’s possible that’s because other parts of the immune system attacked and defeated the coronavirus — but antibodies and the cells that produce them are the keys to remaining protected. The low levels of antibodies here also may make it difficult to interpret population-level data; if someone was infected but didn’t produce antibodies, will we get an accurate count of cases?

In other coronaviruses — the ones that cause the common cold — the way people form antibodies seems to vary by age: people over the age of 60 are better at forming antibodies that neutralize the virus as well as ones that signal to the immune system’s killer cells.

There’s another way antibody testing might be useful, but it’s pretty far off. We know most vaccines work by generating an antibody response, says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibody testing might help drugmakers figure out whether their vaccines against COVID-19 work. In fact, we already do this with the flu vaccine. We know that a certain level of antibodies means a flu shot is effective. For this to be useful in coronavirus, though, we’d have to have a reliable test that indicates a protective immune response and some sense of what that looks like. Learning those things will take time, and we don’t know in advance how long it will be.

How long does protection by antibodies last?

As a reminder: we don’t know yet whether COVID-19 antibodies confer protection. If protection exists, we also don’t know how long it might last. The virus is too new for us to have long-term data. We know, in some diseases — such as HIV — the most-protective antibodies are also the ones that disappear the quickest, says Gallo.

Sometimes, the body forms antibodies to a disease that last a lifetime, like it does with measles. But other times, the immune system seems to “forget” diseases. Take SARS, another coronavirus disease: three years after infection, about a quarter of people didn’t have any detectable antibodies in their blood. Six years after infection, most people didn’t have any. In a small study of patients who’d recovered from MERS — also caused by a coronavirus — people who got very sick had detectable antibodies to the disease two years later, but people with milder illnesses didn’t.

“It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.”

The limited antibody response may be because coronaviruses aren’t in the bloodstream, Rutherford says. “They’re not really exposed to the full force of the immune system. It’s a slightly different kettle of fish.” Instead, the virus attacks the lungs, liver, kidneys, and some other organs.

The coronaviruses we know best — the ones that cause the common cold — can reinfect people after a certain period of time. A study from the 1970s showed that six people who’d had colds after being exposed to one strain of coronavirus were immune when they were reexposed a year later. But another 12 people in the same study who were exposed to a slightly different strain were only partially protected. A tiny study from the 1990s suggests that coronavirus reinfections are milder than the original infection. The coronaviruses that are closest to the one that causes COVID-19 only create immune protection for about a year, according to a modeling study. That may be a clue to how the new coronavirus behaves.

But Slev cautioned against assuming too much about this coronavirus based on other coronaviruses. “There are assumptions [you can make] by looking at other coronaviruses, but really, you want to know the answer for this specific one,” she says. “So really, it’s important to wait to know what the answer is for this virus and we hope to have that answer soon. But right now, we do not have that particular answer for COVID-19.”

Why are antibody tests useful?

The first known death from COVID-19 in the US was on February 6th, in Santa Clara County, California, but the connection to the virus wasn’t made until April. Overall deaths were up 20 percent in March in Santa Clara County from the previous year. California coroners are now examining deaths from as early as December to see if there were more missed cases.

The evidence from California suggests COVID-19 was circulating in the US well before we realized it — and that some number of people may have been sick with the disease without knowing it. We don’t know how widely it was spreading or for how long because we didn’t start testing for the virus early enough. Testing people to see if they have antibodies to the virus may give health officials a better picture of how far the pandemic spread.

Right now, most people who receive diagnostic testing are allowed to because they feel sick. But we know some infections from the novel coronavirus don’t come with symptoms — and those people are being missed by most of our testing efforts. “Nobody knows what the rate of infection is,” Slev says. “An immunologic study could give us an idea on the true rates of infection in the community.”

Even after the testing criteria changed, though, there still weren’t enough tests available. Widespread testing of the population for the virus hasn’t occurred. Tests have been reserved, instead, for some of the sickest patients. We also know some infections by the new coronavirus are asymptomatic. All that means our confirmed case counts are low, but we don’t know exactly how low. Reliable antibody testing might give us a better picture of how much of the population has already been infected, which might give us a better sense of how quickly the virus spreads.

This kind of work can help epidemiologists figure out how much of the population remains vulnerable to COVID-19, how often asymptomatic cases occur, and exactly how deadly the disease is. “We have suspected that the number of undocumented cases is much, much higher than what has been documented by testing for the virus itself,” says Nikolich-Zugich. Antibodies to the virus don’t fade as quickly as the virus does in the body, and they might give us more accurate information on how widely the disease has spread.

Has this kind of antibody testing been done already?

Yes, in a few locations — though doctors have reservations about how accurate the tests are. In a Boston suburb, a sample of people tested on the street showed that about a third of the 64 people who were tested had been exposed to the virus. In a hard-hit German town, about 15 percent of the 200 people tested had antibodies. Those findings are unusual, though; most tests show that less than 5 percent of the population has antibodies.

For instance, early estimates from Santa Clara County, California, suggest that about 1.5 percent of the population had antibodies. If that’s right, the infection rate is 50 to 85 times higher than the official count for coronavirus cases. In Los Angeles County, there might be 28 to 55 times more people infected if those antibody tests are right. In New York, the antibody testing suggests 10 times more people were infected than the testing numbers reflect. These attempts to figure out how many people were sick used different methods and different tests.

“Literally every single one could be a false positive.”

Both the California studies relied on tests from Premier Biotech, which may have a false positive rate as high as 1.7 percent. That’s a problem since Santa Clara’s study found antibodies in 1.5 percent of the people they surveyed. “Literally every single one could be a false positive,” Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious disease expert at the University of California at Santa Cruz, told BuzzFeed News. “No one thinks all of them were, but the problem is we can’t actually exclude the possibility.”

Experts have fewer reservations about the New York testing numbers, which also showed that about 20 percent of New York City’s residents had been exposed to COVID-19. Several experts had suggested that the confirmed case numbers were 2 to 20 times too low; these results seem to confirm that. The New York tests also used a different antibody test. And while this test will also produce errors, it’s been done in a place with a much higher rate of infections, making the results less likely to be skewed by false positives. There is a sampling problem here, though: since people were tested in grocery store parking lots, any parts of the population that don’t go out — for instance, because they are unusually vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19 — have been missed.

It’s still too early to tell how many people had COVID-19 and didn’t get counted in the official numbers. You should expect to see a bunch more fights between scientists about which studies have good methodology and which ones don’t. (There is a lot of arguing in science, actually.) More reliable data will take time and will come from areas that have been hit harder by the disease.

There have been around 30 attempts at seeing how widespread the virus is, but despite the variations in methodology and fights about accuracy, they broadly show the same thing: most of the population is still vulnerable to COVID-19.

What is a false positive, and why does it matter?

A false positive is what it sounds like: a person who didn’t have a COVID-19 infection but whose test results said they did. In order to determine how likely a test is to produce a false positive, most laboratories use specimens collected from people who have a lot of virus, and people they know haven’t been exposed (for instance, because the sample was taken before December 2019). Test manufacturers often report their “analytic” sensitivity from these samples, which may be more clear-cut than testing in the wild. Independent third-party testing usually leads to a more reliable sense of error rates.

The tests also need to accurately distinguish between people who had the virus that causes COVID-19 and people who’ve had other kinds of coronaviruses. It’s possible that people who’ve recently had one of the four viruses that cause the common cold might test positive for COVID-19 when they’re actually negative, the WHO warns. It’s also possible that people who had SARS or MERS will trigger a positive result.

In the case of antibody testing, false positives matter partly because they’ll give us a wrong picture of how many people have been sick — which could make for bad public health policy. But they especially matter if a person who’s gotten a false positive believes they’re immune and chooses to disregard social distancing. That person is still at risk of getting sick, even if they don’t know it.

“Bad, dangerous information”

Imagine if we were using these tests to put people in groups based on their antibody status, says Rutherford. For simplicity’s sake, imagine a test where 4 percent of results are false positives, and a workforce of 100 people is in a hospital. “You have four people waltzing around saying, ‘Oh, I’m positive, I can’t get it, I don’t need to wear a mask in the ICU,’” Rutherford says. “Au contraire. That’s bad, dangerous information.”

“We can’t accept an extreme number of false positives,” Gallo says. He thinks a 5 percent false positive rate is “on the high side.” “Something is better than nothing right now, yes, but you can get misleading results.”

It’s also possible to get a false negative result, which suggests that you haven’t had COVID-19 even though you were infected. While this also might lead to bad public health decisions, it’s less likely to put a person at risk.

Is it possible to create an antibody test that looks for the right coronavirus?

There are some strategies to make sure that the antibody tests look for the right coronavirus, says Nikolich-Zugich. For instance, the spike protein that the new coronavirus uses to get into human cells “is quite unique in this particular coronavirus relative to the others,” he says. Looking for antibodies to that protein could help discriminate between coronaviruses. (But if other coronaviruses do trip up testing, that might not be a bad thing clinically, says Nikolich-Zugich. It might mean that having a cold recently could protect you from COVID-19; after all, people who are vaccinated against smallpox are also protected against monkey pox, which is caused by a similar virus. In that sense, cross-reactivity would be “a welcome occurrence.”)

If there are all of these uncertainties around coronavirus and antibody testing, what is it good for?

Well, the uncertainties aren’t permanent! Again, we’re just starting to know this virus. Several months from now, we’ll have more information, and years from now, even more.

This is also true of antibody tests, antibodies to coronavirus, and immunity. If we are willing to tolerate this period of uncertainty, we’ll give scientists time to do their jobs. That may mean telling us which tests are useful and which ones aren’t. It might also mean that we keep track of how many people test positive for coronavirus antibodies at a mass scale, rather than as individuals.

The thing people are hoping for is called “herd immunity.” That means that enough people have formed an immune response that the virus doesn’t move through the population like a hot knife through butter. There have been various estimates about how much of the population that would be — some as low as 60 percent and some as high as 90 percent — but no one’s really sure yet because we don’t know how long people remain protected after an infection or even if they are protected at all.

At this point, even our contested antibody testing shows the same thing: we’re not close to herd immunity — not by a long shot. So that’s one immediate use.",real

Or, if not now, then “prior to the end of the year,” as he said at the White House on Friday, which Moncef Slaoui, the drug company executive the president tapped to head the effort, called a “very credible” timetable. By historical standards, it is an extraordinarily ambitious goal. Some vaccines have taken a decade or longer to develop, test and manufacture. The most optimistic time by which a coronavirus vaccine might be ready, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease specialist on the president’s coronavirus task force, is 12 to 18 months.

Underscoring his sense of urgency, Trump has compared the vaccine effort to the Manhattan Project to develop an atom bomb during World War II, and dubbed it “Operation Warp Speed.”

Warp speed is an invented term for travel faster than light, which is possible only in the fictional universe of “Star Trek.” Whether it will work for the creating a vaccine for a lethal disease remains to be seen. But there are a few hundred, possibly thousands, of people now in their 60s who are living reminders of the unintended consequences of putting a drug into people’s bodies without adequate testing.

Genetic engineering greatly speeds the process of developing a vaccine. But public health experts are still sorting through how to test it for safety and efficacy. The primary measure of safety, of course, is that a new vaccine doesn’t make people sick, which is easy enough to verify, although it would need to be tried in a large and diverse population to catch possibly rare side effects.

Efficacy is more complicated: Researchers can detect if people inoculated with the vaccine produce antibodies to the coronavirus, but how do they know if they are actually immune from future infection. One way, obviously, is to just watch them and see if they get sick (technically, if they get sick less often, or less severely, than an unvaccinated control group). But that’s a slow process. The other way, which is gaining support among researchers, is a “challenge trial,” in which volunteers receive an inoculation and then are exposed to an infectious dose of the virus — which clearly poses risks of its own. Challenge trials are usually done for diseases that are not as lethal as the coronavirus, or for which other therapies exist.

Quoted in The Hill, Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, said he did not see how an institutional review board that oversees research would approve a human challenge trial for the coronavirus.

But Operation Warp Speed is proceeding along numerous tracks simultaneously: the genetic engineering of potential vaccines, testing in animals, trials in humans, and ramping up the production of the syringes, vials and other equipment necessary for mass inoculation. On Friday, Trump said “we’re gearing up” to begin manufacturing vaccines even before one (or more) is approved, so that there will be a stock on hand in advance. “That means they’d better come up with a good vaccine,” he said. “It’s risky, it’s expensive,” but it could cut a year off the time that might otherwise be required to put a vaccine into distribution.",real

Here's how it barely missed a trick as it fought the coronavirus.,"The German response to the coronavirus has led the way in Europe and drawn praise around the world.

Its initial success in containing the outbreak was attributed in March to mass testing, swift lockdown, a robust healthcare system, and luck.

But that success has continued into April and May, and the country is now gradually reopening with one of the lowest death rates in the world.

Regardless, the country remains cautious. The Bundestag on Thursday passed a new law mandating more testing and virus mapping, which it hopes will rid the outbreak for good.

The country had its critics along the way, but here's how it got in sight of the finish line.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

On balance, Germany has dealt with its coronavirus outbreak much better than most nations around the world.

The peak of its outbreak — the period marked by the highest numbers of new daily infections — came between March 26 and April 3, during which it maintained a death rate far below the likes of Spain and Italy.

As Business Insider reported in late March, this was attributed to an early lockdown, swift mass-testing drive, a well-oiled healthcare system, and clear government messaging.

Seven weeks on — as the country starts to reopen — not much has changed.

The reproduction number (R) — which indicates how many people the average person infects, and indicates how fast the virus is spreading — has wholly remained below 1, but for one surge from 0.65 to 1.1 last weekend.

But the country weathered the storm with minimal fuss, and its R rate subsided to 0.8 by Wednesday.

Authorities said the surge was caused by outbreaks in a few nursing homes and a factory. North Rhine-Westphalia, where the factory was located, reacted by briefly reimposing lockdown, it ended on Friday.

""If one compares the German death rate with that of other countries, it becomes clear that the number of deaths in Germany has not increased as much as one might have feared,"" Die Zeit newspaper, whose virus tracker has become a go-to resource in Germany, wrote on May 14.

Even so, the government is continuing to move against the virus with purpose.

The Infection Protection Act

On Thursday, the Bundestag passed the Infection Protection Act, a set of precautions to help steer the country from danger as it begins returning to normal.

Testing in care homes and hospitals will be drastically increased. Germany is already testing hundreds of thousands of people a week.

Health authorities must log every negative test result and people considered ""cured,"" so the government can map the virus.

Nurses and care workers will be entitled to a 1,000-euro ($1,080) bonus. Before the crisis there was a shortage of these key workers due to low wages.

Health insurers must now pay for their customers' antibody tests even if they have no symptoms.

Health insurers must make flu vaccines readily available. As winter nears, the government wants to minimize the strain that flu patients place on health services.

'We are seeing half-empty ICUs'

In recent weeks, Germany kept testing people en masse, monitoring those who test positive, and kept intensive care units remained well under capacity.

It allowed those in the most critical of conditions quick, unfettered access to life-saving apparatus like ventilators.

""We are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany,"" the country's lead epidemiologist, Christian Drosten, said on April 26.

""This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic — that is, we brought the reproduction number below 1.""

Germany currently has the capacity to test around 838,000 samples for COVID-19 per week, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

Those who test positive are supervised closely, even after they return to recover in their homes.

In Heidelberg, southwestern Germany, medics were driving around the city checking in on those recently diagnosed with COVID-19, taking blood tests and checking to see if they had deteriorated, The New York Times reported in April.

A lockdown so effective it almost backfired

Drosten, who is director of Berlin's Institute of Virology, added he was concerned the lockdown had worked so well that some citizens didn't understand the dangers of the virus.

Indeed, protests against the lockdown popped up across Germany on April 25. More have taken place since.

While there was strong support for social distancing, and widespread acceptance of a lockdown, many Germans also felt that the state went too far and was ruining the economy.

Ten thousand anti-lockdown protesters are now expected to amass in Munich on May 16.

""For many Germans I'm the evil guy who is crippling the economy,"" Drosten said on April 26.

While Spain and Italy saw death rates as high as 10% in late March, Germany's death rate around the same time — on March 27 — was 0.74%.

Their success was attributed to four factors:

Testing: In March, between 120,000 and 500,000 people were tested each week, according to various reports. One month later, the UK was yet to match the lower end of that estimate.

Luck: As of March 27, the average age of a German infected with coronavirus was 46, whereas in Italy it was 63. Older people are on average far more likely to die from the virus.

Germany sees the light at the end of the tunnel

Germany has started reopening some schools and allowed businesses and religious venues to open their doors. It also plans to reopen its borders to neighboring countries by June 15.

In some states, museums and restaurants have been open for more than a week.

On Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer league will recommence. It is the first major league in the world to do so, but for safety the stands will remain empty for the rest of the season, and team handshakes are banned.

The Interior Ministry said on Friday that new arrivals from the EU, Schengen area, and UK would not be forced into a mandatory two-week quarantine upon arrival. Those from other nations, like the US, would.

As of Thursday, 7,917 people have died, with 174,824 confirmed cases. The death rate is at 4.5%.

The rate has risen because it takes a number of weeks for those who eventually die from the the virus to be admitted to hospital, and then enter intensive care.

Germany's death rate is still very low compared to other nations. It is 14% in the UK, 6% in the US, and 15% in France.

On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel was asked how people should act now the lockdown was ending. ""Social distancing, face masks, and respect,"" she said.

The country's troubles are far from over, though. It is already in a recession, and warned late last month of the worst economic slump in its history this year.

""The German economy has been tip-toeing on the edge of recession since the beginning of 2019, but it can hide no longer,"" said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

""The economy entered a technical recession at the start of the year, and this before the incoming collapse.""

The economy shrank 2.2% in the first three months of 2020, according to the German statistics agency on Friday.

Nonetheless, when it comes to the coronavirus, Germany has been the envy of many other countries — particularly those that were slow to respond to their own outbreaks.

1297,911,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/the_danger_of_letting_lab_coats_run_the_world.html,2020-05-14,The Danger of Letting Lab Coats Run the World,"It should be clear by now that most of the world's leaders were stampeded over the lockdown cliff like so many lemmings. What caused the stampede is even more remarkable: a tiny coterie of obscure, soft-spoken epidemiologists in white lab coats playing with numbers.

Americans trying to keep up with the torrid pace of new developments over the past few months have been hearing about that work — the data-modeling these people do by feeding selected data and a variety of assumptions into a computer. The computer then disgorges diagrams and charts that attempt to describe the future progress of diseases like COVID-19. The most frequently cited COVID-19 modelers are those at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and similar organizations at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the Imperial College in London.

Imperial College is where the brightest star in this tiny constellation emerged. He is Dr. Neil Ferguson, director of the Centre for Global Infections Disease Analysis at the college. Until a little sex scandal sidelined him just recently (delicious story for another day), he was also a key member of the group that has been directing the British government's response to the coronavirus. For that work, the thin, pale, bespectacled 52-year-old has been given a shorter title: Professor Lockdown.

The title is well deserved.

Mid-March saw a rapid upsurge of reported COVID-19 events, starting on March 11 with the World Health Organization's official designation of the coronavirus as a pandemic. At that point, the spread of the disease was obviously already global, with new cases popping up everywhere. Frightening headlines filled newspaper pages and TV screens daily and hourly. Nine states in the U.S., the first being California on March 19, started issuing statewide shutdown orders. Boris Johnson's government did the same for the entire U.K. (There's been no nationwide lockdown in the U.S., Trump instead coordinating with the governors on their responses and enlisting help from the private sector.)

The most frightening headlines of all were kicked off by Ferguson's authorship of a report issued on March 16. Here's the key paragraph, abbreviated, with emphasis added:

In the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behavior, we would expect a peak in mortality (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months[.] ... In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, we would predict approximately 510,000 deaths in G.B. and 2.2 million in the U.S., not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems being overwhelmed on mortality.

Those lines went a long way toward spooking all but a handful of other states in the U.S. to join the lockdown parade. But note the word ""unlikely"" in parentheses. That any society in the face of a serious epidemic would take no mitigating actions was not just unlikely. It was a ridiculous assumption to make, as was the assumption that there would be no change in people's behavior. They were great assumptions, however, if the aim was to cause panic.

What, we may ask, was Ferguson's record on prognostications on epidemics prior to COVID-19? Not so good, according to Brendan O'Neil, a British journalist and editor of the online journal Spike. O'Neil writes:

In 2005 [Ferguson] said up to 200 million people could die from bird flu; the final global death toll between the years 2003 and 2009 was 292. In 2009, the UK government based its 'reasonable worst-case scenario' for the impact of swine flu in Britain on Ferguson's models, saying around 65,000 people could die. In the end just 457 people died. In 2001 Imperial modelling on foot-and-mouth disease shaped government policy, which was to cull six million sheep, cattle and pigs. Later, an expert in veterinary epidemiology said that modelling was ""seriously flawed"".

To this, let's add something from a science reporter, James Ball, who raised other questions about the soundness of Ferguson's research process. As he writes in the Spectator:

In a fairly unusual break from best practice, Ferguson did not release the code on which his model runs (and has run in various forms for several years), saying it was largely undocumented and would make little sense to outsiders. This is poor practice for multiple reasons, not least of which being that replicating another's work is a core principle of science, and essential to check workings. It's also well known among programmers and scientists alike that most code eventually contains errors and idiosyncrasies, for which we must remain constantly vigilant. Far, far simpler models than Ferguson's have ended up containing huge errors that have drastically altered their conclusions.

However that may be, the only thing the American public heard was that more than two million Americans might be dead in three months.

Recall, by the way, that on January 29, which was nine days after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. and two days before President Trump issued his ban on travelers from China, the president announced that he was forming his Coronavirus Task Force. But it would be almost March before the Task Force got into high gear.

It turned out to be quite a bull-riding test for Trump — being bucked by a frightened public over the looming apocalypse portrayed by the media and by the unfolding economic catastrophe he knew could not continue.

How much of a lemming was President Trump? Or the state governors? All of them were, to one degree or another. Thus, we were plunged into the grandest of experiments in authoritarian paternalism, whereby we plebeians — i.e., those without government jobs — are deemed incompetent to judge if it's safe to take a dip in the ocean or a walk in the woods. We can, though, crowd into a Walmart or the local supermarket.

Soon, however, the president saw the cliff ahead and started pushing against the lockdown express. It took some delicate maneuvering, and however much credence he ever gave to the 2.2 million number, he cannily co-opted it for his political purposes, using it to boast that his administration's actions have prevented such horrific numbers from becoming reality.

Ferguson has conceded a bit to his critics, but he also proudly noted that his 2.2 million number had the effect of pushing policymakers into the lockdowns he believed necessary. But Ferguson and his fellow experts might have done well to appreciate what the 19th-century economist Frédéric Bastiat meant when wrote that the prescriber of nostrums must be mindful of not only that which is seen, but also that which is not seen.

What is not seen, as Victor Davis Hanson notes, is ""the likely larger human toll from suicides, family and substance abuse, lapsed medical procedures and tests, and wrecked businesses and lives from the lockdown."" Statistics, for example, from the Centers for Disease Control on May 8 indicate that vaccination against childhood measles has declined by as much as 60 percent nationally since the states started ordering the lockdowns.

Then there is the global perspective. From a United Nations policy brief on April 15: ""Economic hardship experienced by families as a result of the global economic downturn could result in hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths in 2020, reversing the last 2 to 3 years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year.""

Let's sum up with a brutal truth coming from another British commentator, Toby Young, who writes that Ferguson ""suffers from the same fundamental arrogance that progressive interventionists have exhibited since at least the middle of the 18th Century — wildly over-estimating the good that governments can do, assuming there are no limits to what 'science' can achieve and, at the same time, ignoring the empirical evidence that their ambitious public programmes are a complete disaster.""

Great lesson if we can learn from it.

From Ventilators to Testing, we made it happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020

Americans, though, don’t seem to be crediting Trump nearly as much as he would like.

New polling data from SurveyMonkey, which were shared with The Washington Post, show that fully 49 of 50 governors have significantly higher approval ratings for their coronavirus responses than Trump does in recent polls. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll last week showed 43 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak.





The one governor on Trump’s level is Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), whose efforts to reopen his state have proved controversial. In the Post-Ipsos poll, Kemp’s approval rating was 39 percent; in the new one, it’s a similar 43 percent — the same as Trump’s.

Apart from Kemp, the governor closest to Trump is Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D), at 54 percent. No other governor falls below half of their constituents supporting their response.

Here’s the full list:

The data show Democratic governors with an average coronavirus approval rating of 69 percent, while Republican governors are at 67 percent.

But interestingly, most of the highest and lowest approval ratings belong to Republicans.



Among the highest are a trio of moderate Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump — Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) at 85 percent, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) at 82 percent, and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) at 82 percent. They occupy three of the top five slots, and six of the top seven are Republicans.



Hogan has clashed with Trump over the availability of testing and has criticized some of the president’s comments. Baker’s restrictive measures on businesses have drawn rebukes from his own state party chairman, who appears to side with Trump’s push to reopen the economy. The trio also supported the impeachment inquiry into Trump last year.

Interestingly, all three have significantly more support from Democratic-leaning voters than Republicans, with at least 9 in 10 giving each governor a thumbs-up. Scott is at a particularly remarkable 97 percent support among these Democratic-leaning voters. Among Republican-leaning voters, he’s at 66 percent, while Hogan is at 77 percent and Baker is at 69 percent.



The same reversal is true of the other Republican governors ranking in the top seven, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) is at 82 percent overall, including 86 percent among Democratic-leaning voters and 70 percent among Republican-leaning ones. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) is at 80 percent overall, including 92 percent among Democratic leaners and 74 percent among Republican leaners.



On the other end of the scale, though, are many of their fellow GOPers. Of the 11 governors with the lowest approval ratings on coronavirus, nine are Republicans.

Along with Kemp, they including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) at 58 percent. Both governors, like Kemp, have pushed forward with among the most aggressive reopening plans.



Also among the 11 at the lowest end are four Republican governors of Midwestern states — Iowa’s Kim Reynolds, South Dakota’s Kristi L. Noem, Missouri’s Mike Parson and Nebraska’s Pete Ricketts — all at 58 percent. All four were among the latest holdouts on issuing statewide stay-at-home orders or were among the few to never issue them at all.

The only other Democrat to rank among the lowest 11 besides Ige is Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D), at 60 percent.



The numbers reinforce the rallying effect the coronavirus outbreak has created among the American people -- at least when it comes to their governors. They also suggest a more steady, competent response from the federal government might have carried significant upside for Trump; instead, he’s stuck at where he almost always has been in polling of his performance: the low-to-mid 40s.

Not gonna lie, I’d be a little worried.

During this pandemic, some people have taken the opportunity to create some new products to help with the fight against the virus that has caused global lockdowns and over 300,000 deaths worldwide.

Online platforms like Zoom and GoToMeeting have adjusted their platforms for high-demand use so that more people can work remotely and have kids continue the school year with online classes. We’ve discovered that while it’s clearly not for everyone, it’s not so bad.

We’ve seen actual innovation, though. Just a couple of examples include the doctors in Oregon who created a 3D printed ventilator for $10 and an app that helps with “social distancing” by limiting the number of customers in stores by creating “virtual queues.” It’s a win-win for businesses and consumers.

But some “innovations” just sound like a bad idea from the get-go.

Like this cardboard hospital bed that can be turned into a coffin. It is specifically designed for COVID patients.

Would you let your loved one be put in that?

Now, I’m not against a sign company looking to meet a need in the community and repurpose their facility for that.

BUT… there’s just so much wrong with this.

First, having a hospital bed that converts into a coffin is just ghoulish. We don’t send people to the hospital expecting them to die. There is no hope left when someone is put in a bed that could instantly be converted into their coffin.

Second, it’s made of cardboard. That’s dehumanizing. This isn’t a small pet that you bury in the backyard in a shoebox, these are human beings not Speedy the Wonder Hamster that your third-grader is crying over.

Remind me, what happens when cardboard gets wet? Because that could be a problem. You clearly can’t clean someone on this thing, and what about feeding? What happens if someone spills water on it? The biggest problem that I see is that the body itself contains fluids like blood, saliva, sputum, urine, and other things, all of which can spread disease. Even if this thing was treated to be “waterproof” you’d have to toss it the minute bodily fluids touched it and in a hospital setting that would be in pretty short order.

This is a clear case of “didn’t think that one through” and “didn’t consult with a single medical professional.”

But you know that morons in government are going to see this as a brilliant and much-needed innovation in the midst of a pandemic.

Speaking of morons in government…

These bed/coffin combo units might be Governor Cuomo’s new state-mandated nursing home beds–because that completely fits with his policies. Maybe he’ll add in blankets that can double as a body-bag since he’s already sending body bags to nursing homes.

[Quick Update from the author: I think I’m being unfair to Governor Cuomo who has rescinded his disastrous policy that forces nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients now that thousands of people senselessly died. I should also include the other governors who sent COVID-positive patients into nursing homes but have not rescinded the order like New Jersey’s Phil Murphy and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, as well as those simply covering up the data like California’s Gavin Newsom.]

1301,1135,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/05/did-we-give-informed-consent/,2020-05-15,Did We Give Informed Consent?,"Our Federal and state governments implemented unprecedented measures beginning in March to stem the spread of COVID-19. Informed consent provides a foundation of medical ethics. Did our elected officials and public health experts get our informed consent for policies that have put 30 million Americans out of work?

Medical experiments have often been performed on unsuspecting subjects, like the infamous Tuskegee Experiment. The U.S. Public Health Service in 1932 began studying the health effects of syphilis on African- American men recruited with a promise of free health care. Even after penicillin emerged as a treatment, the study participants still only received placebos and went untreated until public revelation in 1972.

Informed consent became the ethical dividing line. According to the American Medical Association, “The process of informed consent occurs when communication between a patient and physician results in the patient’s authorization or agreement to undergo a specific medical intervention.” A patient should be provided information on “the burdens, risks, and expected benefits of all options, including foregoing treatment.”

We canceled sports and public gatherings, closed schools and universities, and shuttered nonessential businesses to “flatten the curve.” The new coronavirus can be transmitted by persons without any symptoms, so isolating the sick is not necessarily effective for COVID-19. Millions of cases over just a few months would overwhelm hospitals; avoidable deaths would result from critically ill patients not receiving the best possible care.

Several epidemiological studies offered frightening worst-case scenarios. The highly influential study from Imperial College in London projected that 81% of Americans would get the illness with 2.2 million deaths. Stay-at-home orders seemed prudent to prevent such a disaster.

Yet even extreme social distancing will not prevent COVID-19 cases and deaths, only delay them. Everyone is potentially susceptible to a brand-new virus; staying home to keep from getting sick does not change this fact. That two weeks or two months of lockdown would prevent the feared deaths from ever occurring was a false hope.

The epidemiological models did not hide this. The Imperial College study warned that with relaxation of suppression measures, “transmission will rapidly rebound, potentially producing an epidemic comparable in scale to what would have been seen had no interventions been adopted.” To avoid these 2.2 million deaths, our current policies would “need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more).”

Herein lies the potential lack of informed consent. Was it ever clearly explained that our policies were merely going to delay the health crisis? Would we have chosen to bear such immense economic pain for only a stay of execution?

The policies implemented in March will likely prove unsustainable. The nationwide lockdown was inevitably going to either be relaxed or simply collapse as Americans began ignoring the orders, and long before a vaccine or cure would be available. The policy debate has been couched as a choice between public health or the economy, an unconstrained pandemic or a depression. Our unsustainable policies might deliver a depression and a pandemic.

Our delaying action though has bought us time. We have learned more about the foe. We have controlled trial evidence that Remdesivir effectively treats COVID-19 (it is not a cure, but it helps). Doctors have learned that some healthy young persons who have fallen seriously ill were having an immune system overreaction to COVID. And some patients may have been ventilated too quickly.

We have also expanded health care system capacity. Temporary hospitals have been established and ICU beds added. We can test many more people for the virus now and have antibody blood tests as well. We should soon have adequate supplies of protective equipment for health care and nursing home workers.

Knowledge and preparedness should save lives in a potential “second wave.” We can use lessons learned to help reopen businesses and schools safely. Buying time may prove to be the shutdown’s greatest benefit.",fake

So we need to cut ourselves a little slack when it comes to our expectations regarding healthy routines.

As someone who’s struggled with his weight his entire life — during the past five years, I’ve managed to lose, and keep off, 80 pounds — I offer a few thoughts for how to focus on your physical health in an age of coronavirus and social distancing.

Also, I’ve been working from home for more than five years. So I know a thing or two about making sure you’re not raiding the fridge and cupboards at every possible opportunity.

I’m not a medical professional. I was a pretty fat guy, though, so I also know a thing or two about defeating old habits, developing better ones and getting into a successful routine.

And I spent three years working on my latest book, “Big Problems: A Former Fat Guy’s Look At Why We’re Getting Fatter And What You Can Do To Fix It” (TarcherPerigree, $17), which came out Tuesday.

For the book, I interviewed doctors, body builders, trainers, nutritionists, marathon runners and more, I tried bodybuilding, long-distance running, powerlifting and even spin classes, CrossFit and yoga, to try to answer a few incredibly complex questions:

Why is it so hard to lose weight? Why is it so easy to get overweight? And what does it mean to be healthy?

With that in mind, here are some tips to help you deal with your health, eating habits and anxiety during this acceptably scary time.

Shoot for good enough, not perfection

It’s hard to have a successful routine regarding your physical health even when there isn’t a global pandemic. That’s why you should feel OK if you aren’t doing a zillion things. It’s OK to not eat “perfect.” (Perfection with your eating is a myth, by the way. There is no perfect meal. OK, maybe a pepperoni-and-sausage pan pizza from Pequod’s.)

Instead, focus on everything being good enough. Have a good enough workout (if you choose to exercise). Have a good enough meal.

Good enough right now is actually quite great.

Make a plan, do your best to follow it

If you’re concerned about your health during the lockdown, or just want to get in better shape — feel free to define this however you like, by the way — you need to make a plan. A goal without a plan is just a wish. So figure out what you’d like to work on. And some kind of structure right now is incredibly important.

If you’re concerned about eating too much while in lockdown mode, write out a meal plan that matches your goals. This can be as simple as deciding what you’re going to eat that day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Then, you just do the plan. And try to do it good enough.

What about when you wander through the kitchen and see some goldfish crackers? Maybe you should have six handfuls? Well, go back to the plan. Did you plan for goldfish crackers? No? Then, try to not eat ‘em.

Want to exercise more or keep up some kind of existing routine? Write down what your plan is. (I’m not going to tell you how to get into exercise. My book has a lot of options on that. Also, if you Google “home workouts” you’ll find 9,174 YouTube videos that are a great start.)

Once you’ve written down your plan, try your best to follow it. If it sucks and you hate it, look up a new kind of workout to do. The best workout is the one you’ll do consistently. And if you actually like what you’re doing, odds are you’ll do it more.

If you’re just starting and haven’t regularly done exercise before, ease into it. Do less than you think you should. That’ll make it more enjoyable in the long run, trust me.

When I began lifting weights five years ago, I started in my apartment for months, using cheap dumbbells I got on Craigslist and a crappy bench that smelled like feet before moving on to a gym and also running outdoors.

Now that the gym is closed, I “lift weights” three days a week at home using cables and small dumbbells and my body weight and also go on medium-length runs two or three days a week. It’s not perfect — but it’s good enough, especially now.

Am I planning on competing in a strength competition or bodybuilding competition or a marathon in the next few months? Uh, no. Neither are you. So whatever you’re doing, it’s good enough.

Don’t want to do strenuous exercise? Try walking! One recent large-scale study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that for every 4,000 steps a person took, regardless of their speed, their risk of dying from cancer, heart disease or anything else drops by at least 50 percent.

Just like with other endeavors, even if it’s walking, write down your plan, then try to stick to it.

For parents reading this, I know you’re being asked to do your regular job and be a teacher right now, so adding another daily task is daunting. But you need to take time to focus on yourself, too. You could always create a family workout time, even just a neighborhood walk, helping you complete your goals and your kids burn off some energy.

Focus on your mental health

One of the biggest things I discovered in my research is how much mental health plays a role in physical health. And if you are suffering from obesity currently, there’s a good chance you’re also dealing with anxiety, depression or both.

When your mental health is out of whack, it’s sometimes a full plate just to get out of bed, go to work and be productive. Trying to add other things on top of that — developing better eating habits, an exercise routine, writing that vampire-alien-werewolf-love-triangle stage play — can just be too much.

So if you don’t have the mental bandwidth to do more than you’re doing, that’s OK. Anyone who tells you differently is lying or probably has some fake productivity tool they’re trying to sell. We’re all already doing so much, and you should be proud of yourself just for making it through the day.

On this front, it might be good to not focus nonstop on the news. It can be stressful. For some, that stress can trigger overeating. Set timers for your daily social media usage and news consumption — basically a media diet. Getting your information in bigger chunks might be better than snacking throughout the day, just like with food.

Many mental health providers are offering teletherapy during the lockdown. And you can reach out to friends and family and do this thing people used to do way back in the 1990s: talk on the phone.

I just did a virtual Zoom “book party” to celebrate my launch and had people from across the country (and Canada) join in. I’ve had friends who’ve held virtual dinner parties (they all tried to make the same recipe), some who’ve had birthday parties, and one of my buddies attended a virtual wedding.

Community and connection are as important now as they were before COVID-19.

Get more sleep

Studies show you need seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Any less leads to cognitive impairment, which makes it harder to stick with good habits you’ve set up.

Whenever I hear someone say “I only need two hours of sleep to hashtag grind and be perfect!” what I am hearing someone actually say is I am a big liar. Nobody’s functioning at 100 percent if they’re sleep-deprived.

And right now we’re all dealing with more stress than we’re used to. People we know are losing their jobs and their lives. Whenever I feel any slight ailment, I worry that I’ve gotten sick. I’m concerned for my neighbors, for the businesses around me and their workers, everyone.

Getting enough sleep can help your mental health immensely. It also helps you to make healthier decisions.

If you’re mentally fatigued or physically tired, of course, you’ll eat an entire bag of sour cream and onion chips (the height of Midwestern culinary luxury) instead of making a healthier meal. If you’re tired, it’s also a lot easier to say, “I’m just too exhausted to exercise today, so I’ll do it tomorrow.” And then the next thing you know, whatever healthy routines you’ve built are gone. And you have to start over again.

In the end, we’re going to get through this. I think we’re all going to be much more empathetic than we were. You already see people coming together, helping those in need, acting selflessly.

Just remember to be good to yourself, too. This is a rough time. Nobody’s going through this perfectly. And if you had some good habits before the lockdown and they’ve kinda slid to the side, hey, maybe that’s what you need right now.

Love yourself and others. You’re doing a great job.

But it isn’t. In large parts of the world there are even worse public health hazards, only they don’t get anywhere near the same coverage.

Think things are bad in the UK? Well, at least we don’t have a plague of locusts to worry about.

In 2020, East African countries have suffered the worst locusts invasions for 70 years, and a second, even more destructive wave threatens countries from west Africa to the Middle East, and India.

The World Bank has warned that regional locust swarms (one seen in Kenya was the size of Luxembourg), could swell numbers 400-fold by June, causing costs and damages to food production of up to $8.5bn by the end of the year. All in a region where already around 20m people are severely food insecure.

‘This is a scourge of Biblical proportions- yet as ancient as this scourge is- its scale today is unprecedented in recent times’ UN officials have said.

If giant locusts swarms were bad enough, there’s also the dreaded mosquito. There were 405,000 deaths from malaria in 2018, 94% of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That’s still over 80,000 more deaths than we’ve had so far globally with Covid-19- which at time of writing Africa has seen less than 3,000 deaths from.

What’s more, the World Health Organisation has warned that severe disruptions to insecticide-treated net campaigns and in access to anti-malarial medicines, could lead to a doubling of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa this year compared to 2018.

Yet despite the large number of lives it claims media coverage of malaria is scant.

It’s a similar story with HIV/AIDS. Yes, we all heard a lot about AIDS in the 1980s and 90s, but since then? By 2007 over 20 million Africans- yes 20 MILLION- had died of the disease. Around 770,000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2019- with just over 40% of them in eastern and southern Africa.

That’s down from a peak of 1.7m in 2004, but it’s still a large enough number.

Part of the problem with the saturation coverage of Covid-19 is that it makes us forget that there are other diseases and public health problems which pose even greater threats to mankind. The daily press conferences in the UK, in which the numbers of those who died with Covid-19 is announced, has caused considerable anxiety in the public, but suppose this was done for all deaths? For instance, cancer claims the lives of around 165,000 Britons a year, that’s around 450 people a day. Why isn’t this mentioned at the press conferences so viewers can make the comparison?

One also remembers the video of the policewoman in South Yorkshire berating a man and his children for being in their front garden a few weeks back telling him that ‘a thousand people died yesterday’. But on average you’d expect around 1,600- 1,700 deaths a day in the UK- based on a total of 616,000 deaths in 2018.

If you don’t have such context, then the daily Covid-19 death tallies, which are in fact an aggregate of deaths, including some which occurred several weeks earlier, seem much more alarming. No one is saying that Covid-19 isn’t serious it clearly is- only that a sense of perspective is needed. One can get that perspective by focusing on Africa. It’s been said that no one who visits Africa comes back unchanged and that was certainly the case with me when I went to Zimbabwe in 2014. While we were staying at Victoria Falls, my wife came became ill very suddenly with what we thought was a bad case of malaria, but fortunately was ‘just’ food poisoning. But visiting Zimbabwe made me more aware of the health hazards people there have faced.

The country was devastated by the HIV-AIDS pandemic- by the mid-2000s, life expectancy had fallen to 37 for men and 34 for women- the lowest in the world. In 2008 there was also a bad cholera epidemic, claiming over 4,000 lives, recently there has been an increase in malaria cases too, with a cumulative total of 170,303 up to the third week of April, and 152 deaths.

In the west, and ‘global north’, compared to sub-Saharan Africa, we’ve been very lucky.

Our Covid-19 worries should make us more empathic to people in other parts of the world and understand that living with dangerous infections, viruses which kill many hundreds of thousands of people and the threat of destructive natural pests, is the norm for many.

It got so bad that even his allies and aides pushed for him to stop doing the briefings.

That led to an absolute meltdown, even by Trump standards, over the weekend.

We should root for more Twitter meltdowns, however embarrassing they are, because at least they don't endanger lives.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump's Twitter meltdown over the weekend was more proof that the 45th president lacks impulse control and demonstrates at times frightening ignorance, but his online tirades are still preferable to some of his other recent communications.

The wild coronavirus briefings are getting worse

After a rare humiliation within his inner circle, the president skipped the daily coronavirus health briefings over the weekend, reportedly after being begged to dial back on the free wheeling media appearances by a number of his aides and allies.

The briefings, intended to inform the public on the federal government's response to the pandemic which has brought the country to the brink of an economic depression, have become fonts of conflicting information, self-pity, and self-congratulations — at least when Trump is at the microphone.

It's campaign season, and Trump is clearly itching to be on the road presiding over rallies before thousands of adoring followers. But that's not going to happen any time soon.

So he's used the briefings as his opportunity to attack his adversaries, brag about his administration's largely imaginary successes in fighting the virus, and generally stay front-and-center of media coverage, which is where he always needs to be.

But even for the most devoted Trumpists, there can be too much Trump.

The nadir of the Trump-corona Show was last Thursday, when Trump mused about the possible healing powers of injecting bleach into the human body.

The president told a national audience: ""I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So you're going to have to use medical doctors with — but it sounds interesting to me.""

Though the usual Trump apologists in conservative media claimed he had been misquoted, Trump himself debunked that claim by saying he was being ""sarcastic.""

""I was asking a sarcastic, and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside,"" Trump said Friday. ""But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands. That would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters.""

Jokes typically fail when they have to be explained (or when they lack punchlines). And Trump has a penchant for retroactively declaring something he said is ""a joke"" when it's too absurd for all but his most cynical supporters to defend.

After five years of the Trump Show, most of us are numb to his relentless self-promotion and attacks on anyone he deems his enemy. They're needless distractions during public health briefings, but they're not a threat to public health.

In contrast, his extemporaneous thought bubbles are genuine threats, as partially evidenced by the over 100 calls to Maryland's coronavirus hotline asking if the president's disinfectant cure was a good idea.

Twitter tirades are embarrassing, but they beat the alternative

The disinfectant fiasco was enough for Trump's inner circle to suggest a self-benching over the weekend.

Trump tweeted Saturday that the briefings intended to reassure the public during a time of historic crisis, but which he had instead used as free publicity, were ""Not worth the time & effort!!""

Without his daily platform to spread misinformation — intentional or otherwise — Trump took to Twitter and put on a master class in metaphorically declaring himself ""not owned,"" despite all evidence to the contrary. No one was spared. He not only went after the typically Trump-friendly Fox News, but also the generally pro-Trump Wall Street Journal editorial page.

He also went after the ""Noble Prize"" committee in a series of tweets for bestowing awards on reporters for their ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" coverage.

Most people fairly assumed he meant ""Nobel,"" which does not have a journalism award and hasn't given any awards to reporters who covered the Mueller investigation. For good measure, the free speech-loathing Trump called for ""all the great lawyers out there"" to join him in suing ""all, including the FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS.""

He'd later delete these tweets, and again claim he was being sarcastic.

""Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, ""having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals,"" the self-declared very stable genius tweeted.

Trump returned to his coronavirus briefing platform on Monday, limiting himself to such patently absurd statements as ""you would have been at war with North Korea if I wasn't president"" and boasting of ""the greatest economy in the history of the world"" before he had to deal with an actual crisis.

It's a shame, but hardly surprising, that Trump couldn't stay away from the briefings. His screaming Twitter tantrums are national embarrassments, but they do less damage than his politicized, fact-bereft coronavirus briefings.

Who knows if he'll again retreat to Twitter, or return to the daily spittle-fest that was ostensibly a public service, or some combination of the two. But for the health of the American people, it'd be better if he stayed away from the podium.",real

And almost two-thirds of US adults said that if they had coronavirus symptoms, concerns over out-of-pocket costs would be an important factor into whether or not they decided to go to a doctor.

Even before disaster struck, the US' employer-based health insurance model created a byzantine system that made reimbursement for even basic services maddeningly difficult.

A socialized healthcare system is a non-starter in the US, but the current system that ties health coverage to employment and to a profit-driven third party has created a social safety net full of massive holes.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The US health insurance model is broken and the pandemic could be its moment of reckoning.

COVID-19 isn't exposing new flaws, per se, but the sudden shift in healthcare coverage for millions of Americans is going to throw in stark relief just how bad things have gotten.

But before that, let's remember just how much of a mess even simple things are. I'll use myself, healthy and insured, as an example.

Run-of-the-mill brokenness

I went to get a measles-mumps-rubella inoculation prior to a trip last year to Israel, which had been in the midst of a measles outbreak.

The MMR vaccine is about as basic as preventative health care gets. Babies start receiving it as early as six months. It's essentially required for college students.

Due to logistical issues with my doctor, I had to pay out of pocket for the vaccine but I was assured by my insurer that the cost would be reimbursed.

I wouldn't be fully reimbursed for nearly six months.

During that period I spent at least 10 hours on the phone with my insurance company, and also filed and re-filed paperwork and receipts scanned to PDFs (because cameraphone scans would simply not do), before eventually moving on to filing appeals after my first attempts at reimbursement were rejected.

It was a duel where the only way to win was to outlast my opponent. While I eventually was reimbursed, it amounted to taking on a second unpaid job to get my own money back for a completely legitimate medical expense. And this was all while enrolled in the highest-tier healthcare available under my employer's plan.

A lot of people would have just given up, a result that would not displease the insurance companies.

That was a simpler time, one of international air travel and in-person elective doctor visits.

A coronavirus-sized gap in the social safety net

As the country closes in on Great Depression-levels of unemployment, the employer-based health insurance model is also facing a potential reckoning.

About half of the US relies on employer-based health insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates about 27 million Americans and their dependents either have lost or will soon lose access to their health insurance as a result of the coronavirus-driven economic chaos.

The good news is that about 80% of them will be to get coverage through Medicaid or can get access to a subsidized plan through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges (which President Trump recently reiterated he still wants to kill, despite the pandemic afflicting his constituents).

The bad news is that still leaves about 5.7 million Americans ineligible for Medicaid or a subsidized ACA plan, which means they could be paying shockingly high prices for coverage or have to go without it entirely. In our ""take care of yourself"" culture, these were people who had been doing it ""the right way.""

And these insurance losses could exacerbate the health risk of the pandemic. Almost two-thirds of adults said ""the potential out-of-pocket costs would be very or somewhat important in their decision to get care if they had symptoms of the coronavirus,"" according to an April report by The Commonwealth Fund.

So right when we want people to go to the doctor and get tested swiftly to limit the spread of the virus, millions of more Americans are left weighing whether getting their cough checked out is worth the cost.

This shouldn't happen in any advanced country, much less one as rich as ours, where we throw state and federal subsidies at any number of private ventures on the pretense that they ""create jobs.""

The old argument over whether a person should go bankrupt because of a broken leg is obsolete. The new argument is whether a person should go bankrupt because a pandemic destroyed their ability to earn a living is the one we need to have.

Americans are all over the place with how they feel about healthcare

Even with the social safety net disaster we currently face, a fully-socialized ""Medicare for All"" healthcare system with no private options is a non-starter in the US, and for good reason.

Far more than healthcare would be at stake. It would dramatically redefine both the economy and the role of government. Moreover, its most vocal proponents have never quite been able to articulate how to offset the plan's high cost.

The push-pull of a broken system and roughly-defined alternatives have left Americans confused about what they want out of the system. Polls show that about three-quarters of Americans like their health insurance. But a majority favor a national health system. Though that number drops if it means replacing private insurance.

As a country, we're completely all over the place with how we feel about healthcare.

We don't want to end up rationing healthcare like they do in countries with socialized medicine. But we already do that here through a public/private hybrid system that hinges on the participation of a profit-driven third party.

It's a byzantine system that requires — among many other barriers — pre-authorizations by primary care physicians, pointless consultation appointments that could easily be done electronically before critical procedures, and any number of regulations that make some of the best doctors choose to simply opt-out of accepting any insurance at all, leaving their services only available to the wealthiest patients.

Then there's the out-of-pocket costs that some people can't afford to make, or don't want to risk laying out upfront out of the very reasonable fear that their health insurance company will make it virtually impossible to be reimbursed.

In reality, it's more likely that Americans like their doctors and know that a change in insurance could mean those doctors will no longer be available to them.

Former President Barack Obama knew that, too, which is why he made the false promise that ""if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.""

While the ACA (a.k.a Obamacare) increased the number of insured Americans, it doubled-down on the third-party insurance system whose vulnerabilities have never been more evident than during the pandemic.

The figure of 27 million Americans suddenly scrambling to find health coverage is a disaster and the disturbing data showing a majority of Americans are too frightened to seek treatment even if they're showing symptoms of COVID-19 is proof that the system has failed.

Whatever comes after the coronavirus, the current system cannot be deemed acceptable.",real

And the more tests we do, the more cases we will find.

If the country remains locked down, there will be more cases of COVID-19 reported, and more deaths. There will also be increasing economic devastation, which itself causes deaths, and many more deaths from other medical conditions that have been untreated.

If an epidemic starts in one or a few locations and is promptly identified, it can be contained. But COVID-19 was probably circulating worldwide for at least a month before it was recognized. That’s how as many as half the people in certain places got antibodies.

The idea of “flattening the curve” was to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. It was a delaying tactic, with no prospect of ending the disease. In a few places, especially NYC, hospitals are struggling. In most places they are nearly empty and going bankrupt for lack of patients. The “expert” models that predicted 2 million deaths in the U.S. were wildly wrong.

What is going on now? It is hard to say. Many deaths are coded as COVID-19, without confirmation, because hospitals get paid more for that diagnosis. (Medicare has paid hospitals by the diagnosis for decades.) Half the U.S. COVID-19 have likely been nursing home residents. Did some die of “failure to thrive” because of neglect? Could be—no visitors are allowed in.

What to do? Let the collapse continue until “we have a vaccine”? Does that mean “until (unless?) everybody is vaccinated with a safe and effective vaccine”? There is NO vaccine for most viruses. The influenza vaccine may be only 30% effective, and many serious side effects are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

What you can do NOW to protect yourself and others:

Stay home if you are sick.

Wearing a mask in public is a “precaution” backed by little evidence. It probably does not protect you but may help protect others. It has germs all over it, outside and inside, so do not touch it. If it is cloth, wash it with soap and water. Don’t wear it while driving—at least one crash may have resulted.

Take your vitamins. Some doctors recommend 5,000 IU/day of vitamin D3, or even more if exposed to a respiratory virus. In an Indonesian study, 96% of patients who died of COVID-19 were vitamin D deficient , and only 7% of survivors had low or deficient vitamin D. Vitamin C, selenium, zinc, and other nutrients help build resistance.

, and only 7% of survivors had low or deficient vitamin D. Vitamin C, selenium, zinc, and other nutrients help build resistance. Ask your doctor about early treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc. It’s a new indication for long-established drugs, being used with great success in Brazil, India, France, Israel, Morocco, Algeria, many other nations, and some places in the U.S. Use is discouraged by the FDA and the AMA, who state there is not enough evidence.

Victoria Leta, 28, a graphic designer living in Brooklyn, bought a Costco membership one year ago and shares it with her boyfriend. They go to the store every two weeks, and Leta says they haven't been bothered by purchase limits in place on items such as bottled water and toilet paper. ""The purchase limits have not affected us, really, but that's because we are only buying for ourselves,"" she says. ""The Kirkland brand toilet paper can last us months."" At Costco.com, a 30-roll pack of Kirkland toilet paper retails for $20. By calculations from howmuchtoiletpaper.com, a 30-roll pack could last a four-person household 40 days. Vinny Tung, a 25-year-old real estate developer in Washington, D.C., also visits Costco once every two weeks. ""I got my first Costco membership when I was in college and I've had it ever since,"" he says. The purchase limits haven't really affected him, either. If anything, the quarantine has resulted in him having a surplus of food. ""Prequarantine, I used to go with some of my friends, but in my current situation, I definitely do not,"" he says.

If you shop smart, you can cut down on food waste

Although Tung has found himself buying a bit more than he can realistically consume, Leta says the quarantine has prompted her to use everything she purchases from Costco. ""To have abundance in this crisis is pure luck and a privilege, and having a Costco membership right now sure as hell is just that,"" she says. Before the pandemic, Leta and her boyfriend would get ""a few staples and a few novelty snacks and coffee,"" but inevitably certain items would always expire before she could use them. ""You buy some perishables and end up going out to eat,"" she says. ""You could get bored with the resources you already had and buy others. It seems so silly now. There is a lot less food waste now that we are cooking everything and being more resourceful with what we have before going out to replenish.""

Social distancing makes for a smooth shopping experience

After the shelter-in-place order came down in New York City, Leta and her boyfriend stood in a long line for their local Costco. Her anxiety grew, she says, as she heard other shoppers talk about possible product shortages and people they knew who were infected by the coronavirus. But upon entering, she was relieved to see that the store wasn't at all packed with people. ""Getting in and shopping at Costco was quite peaceful,"" she says. ""Since they've limited the amount of customers in the store, you're able to move your cart around with ease and avoid bumping into someone."" As the shelter-in-place orders persist and Americans adjust to the new normal, some shoppers find there aren't long waits, either. ""I just went yesterday and there was no line,"" Tung says. ""A month and a half ago when this all started, I went and was like, 'Oh god, this is kind of crazy,' and I left the scene and came back another time.""

As of Thursday, a whopping 774,840 pounds of rice, beans, pasta, tuna, tomato sauce, peanut butter, canned vegetables and other non-perishable items filled every inch of the normal playing surface.

The result is a stunning photo exemplifying the 21,000-seat arena’s abrupt transformation from sporting venue — in a coronavirus-free alternate reality, it would have been prepped for the scheduled Bulls-Nets game on Saturday — to pandemic logistics hub.

The food has been relocated to free up space in the Greater Chicago Food Depository’s main warehouse, according to GCFD senior manager Greg Trotter.

“They’ve been piling up in our warehouse, and they are going into our network, but we’re trying to store some, too,” Trotter said. “We have a feeling that things are going to become significantly worse, in terms of food insecurity, in the weeks to come.”

Roughly two-thirds of the GCFD’s network of food pantries remain open, but they have shifted to a ‘grab-and-go’ format where food-insecure families simply pick up prepackaged boxes or bags, instead of the pre-pandemic method of shopping for the specific kinds of food they wanted.

That’s not the only effect that social distancing guidelines have had on the food depository, either. In the warehouse — located in Archer Heights on the southwest side of the city — volunteers who pack such bags and boxes must now be spaced out more, meaning there’s less room to store food.

And that’s where the United Center comes in.

Trotter said that while the number of coronavirus cases in Chicago may level off in the coming weeks, the depository expects the economic impact of the pandemic — and, specifically, the number of Chicagoans in need of food — to last far longer.

“There’s still going to be a long tail on this crisis,” he said. “People who have been laid off or their income has taken a hit, they’re going to have to get their lives back. This is not something that’s going to be resolved anytime soon.”

“Our neighbors are going to need our help for a long time. We’re bracing for that reality.”",real

The statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the clearinghouse for the web of U.S. spy agencies, comes as President Donald Trump and his allies have touted the as-yet-unproven theory that an infectious disease lab in Wuhan, the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak, was the source of the global pandemic, which has killed more than 220,000 people worldwide.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

In recent days the Trump administration has sharpened its rhetoric on China, accusing the geopolitical foe and vital trading partner of failing to act swiftly enough to sound the alarm to the world about the outbreak or to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.

The new statement says, “The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified.”

“The IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”

Trump addressed the theory earlier this month, saying, “More and more, we’re hearing the story.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added, “The mere fact that we don’t know the answers — that China hasn’t shared the answers — I think is very, very telling.”

Pompeo also pressed China to let outside experts into the lab “so that we can determine precisely where this virus began.”

While Trump and Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, a U.S. intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory. The intelligence official was not authorized to publicly discuss the issue and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Scientists say the virus arose naturally in bats. Even so, Pompeo and others have pointed fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.

“We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,” Pompeo said two weeks ago. The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market that is considered a possible source.

U.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but they have yet to find any evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.

The Chinese government said Thursday that any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are “unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.”

Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang cited the institute’s director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.

“I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,” Geng said.

Geng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on “better controlling the epidemic situation at home.”

But a Chinese government spokesman, Zhao Lijian, demonstrated that China was not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army.",real

As millions of Palestinians living in occupation or exile around the world remember the beginning of the Nakba, the Israelis seem determined to keep the 1968 tragedy alive.

US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, met with Israeli government leaders last week to discuss moving forward with their so-called “peace plan” of annexing nearly 30% of the West Bank.

Annexation and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank are both illegal under international law (not to mention the countless war crimes Israeli soldiers and settlers commit in Gaza and the West Bank).

Unsurprisingly, Palestinians have condemned the potential annexation, as have EU officials and Jordan.

But will the Israelis actually follow through with their plans to annex the land? And if so, will that trigger an Intifada or broader regional conflict?

Capitalizing on the chaos of coronavirus

The Zionist entity has already exploited COVID-19 to tighten its grip on the Palestinians.

During the pandemic, Tel Aviv has shut down Palestinian testing sites, restricted medical aid from entering Palestinian territories, continued arresting Palestinians, and refused to release prisoners.

By closing the borders and clamping down on medical aid, Israel can weaponize the coronavirus as a biological weapon for ethnic cleansing. Following suit, the Trump regime blocked COVID-19 assistance to Gaza claiming it would be used for “terrorism.”

However, Tel Aviv also sees it as an ideal opportunity to move forward with annexation.

Most countries around the world are preoccupied fighting their own battles against the pandemic. Israel, on the other hand, is on the downswing with cases flattening. The coronavirus serves as a perfect distraction for Israeli crimes to slip under the radar.

Last week, the Zionist entity approved an additional 7,000 settlements in the West Bank in preparation to vote on annexation.

Will the Israelis actually follow through with it?

The Zionist push for annexation rides on a wave of right-wing populism around the world.

After over a year of political deadlock and three elections, Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party have reached an agreement to form a coalition government with rival Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party.

On the backdrop of a corruption investigation, Netanyahu faces pressure from his right-wing voting bloc to follow through with reactionary campaign promises such as annexing Palestinian land. One poll found that roughly half of Israeli Jews support annexing West Bank land so long as Washington is on-board.

Netanyahu also must maintain a right-wing strongman posture against centrist Gantz.

However, annexing the West Bank might not necessarily work in Israel’s favor. Several Palestinians already live in the West Bank so Tel Aviv will either need to forcibly remove them or integrate them as Israeli citizens. While it’s certainly not below Israeli standards to violently remove Palestinians, it might prove more trouble than it’s worth should Palestinians put up a fight.

On the other hand, integrating West Bank Palestinians as Israeli citizens would give them voting rights and effectively disband the two-state solution. This is one reason even many reactionary right-wing Israelis don’t support annexation at this time.

If the Israelis are simply looking for US support, however, they’ll have no shortage of that for the foreseeable future.

The Trump regime has declared its unwavering support for the Zionist entity at every turn imaginable. Washington already moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem al-Quds despite outcry from EU allies and Palestinians. Not only does Donald Trump seems poised to secure another four years in the White House, but even Democratic opposition candidate Joe Biden has openly admitted he will not move the US embassy back to Tel Aviv.

So if all they’re waiting for is US support, the Israelis have plenty of that. Whether or not the Israeli legislature will support the motion remains to be seen.

How will Israeli neighbors and allies respond?

Jordan’s King Abdallah told German outlet Der Spiegel he would consider “all options” should Israelis vote to move forward with their annexation plans.

Jordan has been Israel’s most vocal neighbor to condemn the annexation plans – and for good reason.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan shares a 335km land border with Israel and the occupied West Bank. The territory Israel plans to annex includes a 97km stretch of that land border in the Jordan Valley.

King Abdallah no doubt considers the annexation a direct threat to his own country’s security and entire existence. In previous Israeli- and US-led discussions about the so-called Deal of the Century, officials floated the idea of pushing exiled Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan, effectively creating a defacto “Palestinian” state inside Jordan.

But it’s not the 1970s anymore and Jordan has minimal leverage. Resisting annexation by cancelling current peace agreements with Israel would put Amman at odds with Washington: Jordan’s single-largest financial supporter. The United States provides over $1 billion in assistance to Amman every year.

The Trump regime has shown it’s not afraid to cut off financial support to entities and organizations that don’t bend to US pressure. Just last month, Washington ended support for the World Health Organization, claiming the WHO was colluding with China in regard to COVID-19.

Taking a stand against Washington and Tel Aviv on annexation would likely force Jordan to commit entirely and realign its geopolitical allies.

Other neighbors have remained fairly mum about the whole thing.

Anyone waiting for Riyadh to wield their financial and political power shouldn’t hold their breath. Unsurprisingly, nothing but crickets has come out of Saudi Arabia.

On the contrary, Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has strengthened Riyadh’s diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv over the past few years, cooperated with Israel on matters of “security,” and implied it’s time to abandon the Palestinian cause.

It’s worth mentioning that dozens of Palestinian prisoners languish in Saudi jails for “terrorism” charges, proving Riyadh has no problem carrying out Israeli policy in its own land. Of course, there’s also the question of Yemen where Saudi Arabia takes notes directly out of Israel’s genocidal playbook.

An Arab League delegation consisting of officials from Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in early May to discuss their concern with Israel’s planned annexation. The Arab group released a statement condemning the annexation plans as illegal and detrimental to peace in the region.

For his part, UN Secretary-General Guterres said the annexation will end any potential two-state solution and future peace negotiations.

Egypt, another key Israeli ally and accomplice in many cases, expressed its disdain for Tel Aviv’s plans to annex the West Bank. However, Egyptian officials have not provided any potential response from Cairo should Israel follow through with the plans.

Like Jordan, Egypt’s hands are tied as it relies on the United States for financial assistance: Washington has provided Cairo with $70 billion in economic and military aid since 1980.

Over the past few decades, Washington has successfully kept Israel’s neighbors docile through financial support with political strings attached. While many neighboring countries have condemned Israel’s annexation plans, it’s hard to see a situation where any real action is taken.

European Union foreign ministers have discussed imposing sanctions against Israel if the Zionist entity completes the proposed annexation this summer. Such sanctions could result in the EU removing Israel from certain research programs and agreements.

While not all EU members support sanctions, the EU as a whole seems to agree that annexation is a step away from peace.Washington’s unwavering support for Israel – such as moving the embassy, tearing up the JCPOA, and now the so-called Deal of the Century – continues to put the US at odds with its western allies.

How will Palestinians respond?

The Israelis and their allies in Washington seem to underestimate the resilience of the Palestinian people.

A poll out of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that a whopping 94% of Palestinians reject the plan. Meanwhile, 64% waging an armed struggle to resist implementing the so-called Deal of the Century, which involves annexation.

Even president of the Palestinian Authority, which colludes with Israeli security and effectively carries out Israeli repression in Gaza, condemned Israel’s annexation plans. In April, Mahmoud Abbas saidif the Zionist entity moves forward with annexation, “we will disengage from all commitments and agreements.”

Abbas Hamideh, founder of Al-Awda: The Palestine Right to Return Coalition, says the Zionist entity will go through with their West Bank annexation if the international community doesn’t step in to stop them:

“Unfortunately, Palestinians are limited in responding and cannot do much about it as they are powerless against the overwhelming Zionist occupier. Other than speaking out with their voice, there will be very little they can do.”

Annexation is anything but peaceful

Annexing any part of the West Bank is aggressive and violent on multiple levels. The United Nations has condemned Zionist settlements in the West Bank and declared them illegal on multiple occasions.

Under the so-called peace plan, these areas of the Jordan Valley flagged for annexation are rich in resources and prime locations for agricultural development. Kicking Palestinians out and telling them to make do with the rest would set up their state for failure.

The so-called Deal of the Century also demands that a future Palestinian state have no functioning airport or even military. What sovereign country isn’t “allowed” to have a military or even an airport?

If the Zionist entity moves forward with annexation, it will no doubt expel Palestinians violently from their homes, killing many in the process and forcing neighbors like Jordan and Lebanon to take in even more Palestinian refugees.

Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria are already housing thousands of Palestinians living in exile waiting to return to their homes – their right to return is guaranteed to them according to the Fourth Geneva Convention.

Following through with annexation is a violent and aggressive act – not only against Palestinians but also for Israel’s neighbors and European allies. It seems the US is the only entity supporting them openly at this point.

The European working class will be hit hardest by the economic devastation.

And yet, the European poor will be much better off than their American counterparts, since they have universal healthcare and subsidized wages for people who have lost their jobs.

A couple of weekends ago, a video of people defying France's coronavirus lockdown and dancing together in the streets of Paris set French Twitter alight. Police arrived and dispersed them peacefully, letting the balcony ""DJ"" off with a warning. But many suggested law enforcement would have reacted differently if the gathering of people, in the gentrified neighborhood of Montmartre, had not been middle class and white.

The incident was particularly inflammatory because it followed several nights of violence in lower-income neighborhoods just a few miles north, where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets towards groups of young people who torched cars and lit dumpster fires. The clashes began after an incident between police and a motorcyclist that landed the latter in hospital, but they were rooted in broader grievances about France's strict eight-week lockdown and its outsize impact on people in the banlieues, or working-class suburbs.

Across Europe, shutdowns have wreaked economic chaos—France just suffered its worst economic contraction since World War II, while the UK is on track for its deepest recession in 300 years. The poor will of course be hardest hit. Already, long lines of people snake through France's low-income neighborhoods towards food distribution sites. But as dire as it is, those people will likely end up better off than their American counterparts. They have universal healthcare and state-subsidized furlough pay. And because most have not been permanently laid off, they'll be back to work when businesses reopen on Monday.

Inequality is rife

Several weeks into confinement here in France, the public health chief announced that Seine-Saint-Denis — one of the poorest, and densest, departments in France — had seen a spike in deaths compared to other areas around Paris. The far-right politician Marine Le Pen accused the government of not adequately enforcing lockdown measures there, while French media snapped photos of crowded sidewalks and described the department's residents as ""undisciplined"" for not respecting the rules. But the banlieues supply many of Paris' essential employees, such as cashiers, cleaners, and garbage-truck drivers. The people seen out and about in Seine-Saint-Denis were likely just going to work.

Not that those commutes are easy. Public transportation has been significantly reduced, and one grocery store employee from Cergy-Pontoise, another suburb, told me the train he takes to work has only been running once every two hours. He said that's also why more people can be seen on the streets in his neighborhood — they don't have many shops to begin with, and have to walk further to access them.

Meanwhile, the wealthy central arrondissements of Paris are quiet. According to data from the French telecom Orange, more than a million Parisians fled the city when the lockdown was announced. Those that left managed to avoid, among other things, the daytime exercise ban — a Paris-only rule prohibiting outdoor physical activity between 10 am and 7 pm. And while some lucky city-dwellers might have backyards or rooftops, most have now gone eight weeks without access to green space because parks have been closed since March 16.

According to Dr. Jennifer Heisz, an expert in brain health and associate professor in kinesiology at McMaster University, not being able to exercise can have serious physical and mental health consequences. Working out makes us more resilient to everyday stressors, as well as preventing stress-induced inflammation, which can lead to anxiety and depression.

But physical activity — and outings in general — have been restricted across Europe. The Italian region of Lombardy banned outdoor exercise altogether in mid-March. Spain did the same, and, for six weeks, also banned children from leaving their homes. Here in France, we are only allowed out once a day, for a maximum of one hour, and can only travel 1 kilometers (0.6 miles) from home. Calls to domestic abuse hotlines have skyrocketed.

Breaking these lockdown rules can get you in hot water. We have to carry ID and documentation to justify being outside in case paramilitary gendarmes stop and question us. As of late April, French police had carried out 15.5 million stops and administered 915,000 fines. But the decision to fine is extremely subjective. For example if you go out for groceries — one of a handful of acceptable reasons for leaving the house — it is up to the officer to decide whether your chosen store is within a ""reasonable"" distance from your home or whether you have abused your privileges.

The fines themselves are indicators of socioeconomic status too. Many of my friends initially shrugged off the idea of getting one (€135 for your first infraction); if they really needed to break the rules, they'd just risk getting caught and paying it. But over the weeks, the law has been tightened. Now, a second infraction can cost as much as €1,500 and a fourth can cost €3,700 — and land you in prison for six months. Again, this matters if certain people are disproportionately targeted.

It's going to be worse in the US

While the inequalities in Europe have been severe, the situation is likely to be even worse in the US.

Here, the shutdowns have at least succeeded in their objectives of flattening the COVID-19 curve. Cases in Italy, Spain, and France peaked in early April and have fallen ever since. By contrast, new cases in the US have plateaued at a still-high level. And despite some state governors pushing to lift restrictions, virus cases are on the rise outside of New York City.

Another major difference is that French medical care is government-funded, rather than provided by employers. The ease with which any tax-paying resident can walk into a medical clinic and be seen by a doctor may have helped boost early detection. And, importantly, those that may have lost their jobs due to the pandemic can still access care, unlike American workers, who, if laid off, will suddenly find their healthcare gone as well.

Relief is in sight on the economic front, here, too. In France, as in other European countries like Germany, layoffs have largely been avoided. Instead, the government directly supported businesses so that they could keep staff on payroll — essentially paying companies to put employees on temporary paid leave instead of letting them go. That means those companies are still fully staffed up and ready to reopen next week. It also means their workers have continued to be paid 84% of their regular salaries.

Meanwhile, the US reported on Friday that more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April and many businesses are disappearing altogether. Government support has been meager, with limited funds to small businesses and a one-time check of up to $1,200 per person.

Some people have, no doubt, slipped through the cracks here in Europe, especially in the informal sector. But things could have gotten a lot uglier. Now, thanks to solid healthcare and temporary unemployment benefits, the worst appears to be over. The same cannot be said for the US.",real

The Chosen Few Picnic & House Music Festival, which generally brings in 40,000 attendees annually, was scheduled for July 4 in the South Side’s Jackson Park neighborhood, has been postponed, according to an official announcement Friday.

In its place, a virtual event scheduled for the same date, will feature a free, live-streamed performances and DJ sets from the Chosen Few DJs, and more.

“The decision to transition our beloved ‘Woodstock of House Music’ from a mass in-person gathering to a virtual one this year was not an easy one,” said picnic officials in a statement. “Like many of you, we want nothing more than to get together with our fellow house music lovers in person, just as we have done for the past 29 Julys. However, given the extraordinary time we are in, and the critical health dangers associated with large gatherings, we know this is the safest course of action for our picnic attendees, guest performers, vendors, and neighbors.”

Tickets purchased for the 2020 festival will be honored at the 2021 event. Ticket holders also have the option to submit a request for a refund at https://explore.seetickets.us/refund-form-chosen-few-2020/. Refund requests must be made by 11:59 p.m. on May 22, 2020.

Details about this year’s virtual event on July 4 will be announced in the coming weeks.

In addition, for the first time in the festival’s history, organizers are asking the public for online contributions to help support COVID-19 charitable efforts. Details about making the donations will also be announced in the coming weeks.

Chosen Few DJ Alan King says a lot of thought will go into the virtual event.

“We’re going to encourage people to go out in their backyards and set up a tent like they would have if they went to the Chosen Few [picnic], but in their backyard or on their rooftop,” said King.

Earlier this week, the city canceled some of Chicago’s biggest summer music events, including the Blues and Gospel festivals.

South Side summer event cancellations/postponements due to the COVID-19 pandemic include the Silver Room Block Party, South Shore Summer Festival and the Taste of WVON, among others.",real

The financial support will enable U. of C. and its partners to expand testing to 1,000 people a day, according to a statement Tuesday. Uninsured patients will be tested for free, while those with health insurance will simply have their provider billed and won’t be subjected to co-pays.

The grant funding comes from the nonprofit United Health Foundation, which was established by the UnitedHealth Group, a publicly traded health care firm based in Minneapolis. The donation is part of the company’s initial $70 million commitment to fight COVID-19 and support areas that have been disproportionately affected by the virus.

“We are grateful to the United Health Foundation for its support of our efforts to provide much needed care to communities disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 emergency,” said Brenda Battle, vice president of UChicago Medicine’s Urban Health Initiative and chief diversity and inclusion officer.

“The financial support will allow South Side health care providers to ramp up staff and supplies needed to make testing more widely available to those most at risk in the community, which is critical to our efforts to prevent further spread of COVID-19.”

Five zip codes included in U. of C.’s coverage area have some of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chicago, with African Americans bearing the brunt of the infections. As of Monday, blacks accounted for 60% of the 2,576 confirmed cases in those zip codes.

Earlier this month, U. of C. officials announced a partnership to ramp up screening for the deadly virus. In addition to testing at the University of Chicago Medical Center and Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, U. of C. is also partnering with community hospitals, nursing facilities and federally qualified health centers.

U. of C.’s “testing partners” include La Rabida Children’s Hospital, St. Anthony Hospital, St. Bernard Hospital, Palos Heights Hospital, Family Christian Health Center, Montgomery Place, Symphony South Shore and Villa at Windsor Park. Some are conducting coronavirus testing, while others are simply referring patients to U. of C. for testing.

The grant money will support that initiative and also be used to train staff members to test and treat patients, conduct contact tracing, pay for personal protective equipment and other supplies and provide temporary housing for those who test positive.

New testing site in Humboldt Park

The announcement comes five days after the state reached the elusive goal of conducting 10,000 daily tests. Since Friday, the state’s daily testing numbers haven’t dipped below 11,985.

As the state’s testing capacity has increased, attention has shifted to running more tests in underserved communities in Chicago. Starting Tuesday, all adult residents of Humboldt Park symptoms and an appointment can now get tested in the parking lot of Norwegian American Hospital, 1044 N. Francisco Ave.

“We now have a hospital on the Northwest Side of Chicago that will service our Latino and immigrant community,” said Cesar Rolon of the Illinois Latino COVID-19 Initiative, a group of Latino officials, health professionals and representatives of community-based organizations.",real

The Justice Department on Tuesday put California Gov. Gavin Newsom on notice, claiming that his plan for the state's staggered re-opening from the threat posed by the coronavirus discriminates against religious groups and a return to in-person worship services. Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, chief of the department's Civil Rights Division, warned the governor that places of worship were being forced to take a back seat to a gradual resumption of operations at schools, restaurants, offices and shopping malls.

That's what you do when you believe, as Newsom does, that religion is non-essential or downright pernicious.

Which of these is not like the other?

California is starting the process of reopening some areas of its economy and activities following restrictions designed to prevent or slow the spread of the coronavirus illness COVID-19. The state is currently early in ""stage two,"" which allows curbside retail service and some manufacturing and other activity with restrictions. In-person religious services, along with hair and nail salons and movie theaters, aren't eyed until stage three, and even then, there will be limits on the size of gatherings, according to published materials on the plan.

Nail and hair salons require close proximity and have no special constitutional protection. Religious services don't and do.

Dreiband, in a letter to the governor, cast the policy as ""differential treatment"" that unfairly singled out religious worship for restrictions that the state would not impose on other activities. ""The Department of Justice does not seek to dictate how states such as California determine what degree of activity and personal interaction should be allowed to protect the safety of their citizens,"" the letter states. ""However, we are charged with upholding the Constitution and federal statutory protections for civil rights. Whichever level of restrictions you adopt, these civil rights protections mandate equal treatment of persons and activities of a secular and religious nature.""

It's about time that there were equal rights. Instead of condescending dismissals.

Newsom said Monday at a news conference that some restrictions on churches, including counseling services and other activities, have been eased, ""but for the congregants, that's a few weeks away."" He expressed his ""deep admiration"" to the faith community and its desire to know when congregants can return.

That's how you talk to a minority you don't understand and have contempt for, but patronize on occasion.

That's not how you talk to the bearers of the First Amendment.",fake
1371,166,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/latest-hipaa-updates-response-covid-19/,2020-03-26,The Latest HIPAA Updates in Response to COVID-19,"In light of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, government officials, medical professionals, and public health authorities have been forced to navigate an increasingly difficult situation. With a focus on affording the population widespread access to care, many regulations have recently been amended in order to assist the health care system in combating the spread of COVID-19. During an infectious disease outbreak or other emergency situation, it is important for clinicians to continue adhering to official mandates despite the national emergency.

As such, the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has recently shared an updated bulletin reminding health care providers of the ways in which patient information can be shared under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. As per the HIPAA rule, the notice recognizes the need for public health officials to have access to protected medical information as a method of protecting the health and safety of both individual patients and the public at large. As such, it permits covered entities to disclose protected health information without authorization when mandated necessary.

Guidelines for Sharing Patient Information

The HIPAA Privacy Rule is intended to protect the privacy of patients’ health information, with exceptions made for appropriate disclosures of information when necessary to treat a patient, protect the nation’s public health, and for other critical purposes. In the case of a global pandemic, such disclosures may be warranted more frequently as public health organizations and government officials rely on patient health information to inform their directives.

Serving as a reminder of the protections of the Privacy Rule which are not set aside during an emergency, the latest bulletin provides essential guidance for health care providers. The latest HIPAA regulations are outlined below and can be found on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ website as well.

Treatment Information

Under the Privacy Rule, HIPAA-covered entities may disclose protected health information about a patient as necessary to treat both the patient and other patients without authorization. This includes the coordination and management of care as well as all other related services by one or more health care providers and others, consultation between providers, and the referral of patients for treatment.

Public Health Activities

The act recognizes the legitimate need for public health officials and others responsible for ensuring public health and safety have to access protected health information that is necessary to carry out their mission. Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities can disclose the needed health information without patient authorization to public health authorities, at the direction of a public health authority to foreign government agencies, and to persons deemed at risk.

Health care providers are permitted to disclose such information to a public health authority – an agency or authority of the United States government, a State or a territory responsible for public health – as well as an individual acting under a grant of authority from such an agency. This includes the CDC or a state or local health department authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability. Examples include the reporting of disease of injury and vital events (such as births or deaths) or conducting public health surveillance, investigations, or interventions.

Under these regulations, a covered entity may disclose to the CDC protected health information as needed to report all prior and prospective cases of patients exposed to or suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Furthermore, protected information may be disclosed to individuals deemed at risk of contracting or spreading the virus – if allowed for by state law – to notify persons as necessary and prevent the spread of disease.

Disclosures to Family Members and Others

According to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may share protected health information with a patient’s family members, relatives, friends, or other involved individuals. Information may also be shared to identify, locate, and notify anyone responsible for the patient’s care, as well as to convey the patient’s location, general condition, or death. Recipients of this information can include family members and other persons involved in the patient’s life, the police, the press, or the general public. Furthermore, a covered entity may share protected medical information with disaster relief organizations, such as the American Red Cross. However, the covered entity should receive verbal permission from patients when possible before disclosing such information.

Disclosures to Prevent Serious and Imminent Threat

Clinicians are permitted to share protected patient information with anyone to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of a person or the public under applicable law and standards of ethical conduct. Providers may disclose information to anyone who is in a position to prevent or lessen imminent threat without prior permission. Although, in such cases, health care professionals are urged to use professional judgement and care in making determinations about the severity of imminent threat.

Disclosures to Media or Others Not Involved

Unless otherwise noted in the bulletin, clinicians cannot disclose information about an identifiable patient to the media or public at large without written authorization from the patient or their personal representative. However, covered entities may disclose limited medical information in cases of incapacitated patients. Additionally, information can be shared about patients who have not restricted the release of protected health information if this is done in the best interest of the patient or in response to a request to disclose information about a particular patient asked for by name.

Share “Minimum Necessary”

In the majority of cases, information disclosed should be kept at a “minimum necessary” although this does not apply to disclosures to health care providers for treatment purposes. Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities may rely on representations from public health officials to ensure the requested information is the minimum necessary. For example, covered entities may rely on CDC representations that protected health information requested by the CDC about all patients exposed to, suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 is the minimum necessary for the public health purpose.

Safeguarding Patient Information

Medical professionals must prioritize safeguarding patient information; clinicians are responsible for protecting patient health information against intentional or unintentional impermissible uses and disclosures. Covered entities must apply the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards outlined under the HIPAA Security Rule to ensure the confidentiality of electronic medical data.

HIPAA-Covered Entities and Business Associates

Lastly, the HHS’ bulletin reminds clinicians of who the HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to. Currently, the Privacy Rule applies to disclosures made by employees, volunteers, and other members of a covered entity’s or its business associate’s workforce. This includes health plans, health care clearinghouses, as well as health care providers that conduct one or more covered health care transactions electronically. Under the rule, business associates are defined as individuals or entities that perform functions or activities on behalf of or provide services to a covered entity that involve the use of protected health information. These also include subcontractors working on behalf of other business associates.

As such, the Privacy Rule does not apply to disclosures made by entities or other persons who are not covered entities or business associates, such as third-party administrators.

Understanding and following HIPAA rules is crucial to navigating the increasingly complex clinical setting during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Health care professionals are urged to treat all medical information as confidential, affording it HIPAA protections to operate out of an abundance of caution. Disclosures of protected health information should be made only to authorized personnel and care should be taken to ensure patient data is not shared unintentionally. During these tumultuous times, public health organizations and experts will continue to release the latest guidance as it becomes available to help health care providers tackle the disease while protecting themselves.",fake

Today, more than six weeks after the primary, Manny’s is pretty much limited to carryout, curbside pick-up and delivery dining options and walk-in grocery business. And no one is even answering the phone at Cecina Grill.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s March 21 stay-at-home order put the brakes on much activity across Illinois – from bars and barber shops to baseball diamonds and beaches.

And as important as it all is to the politicians, hand-shaking, door-knocking and glad-handing for contributions are not deemed essential business.

Typically, campaigns begin shifting gears after the primary to prepare for the general election — candidates work rooms, attend fundraisers and meet with both would-be donors and potential supporters. Underdogs schedule regular news conferences in hopes of raising their profiles.

But as the state grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, many countywide candidates who are looking to the November general election are doing little campaigning and have reported little, if any, money coming in, according to Illinois Board of Elections filings.

For the county’s marquee race — Cook County state’s attorney — the pandemic has meant a shifting of resources and focus.

Hoping to topple incumbent Democrat Kim Foxx, Republican nominee Pat O’Brien said the coronavirus pandemic has made for a “less than typical fundraising” cycle now focused on Zoom or phone calls as a means for getting funding and support from would-be voters.

“It’s not easy when coronavirus has created economic uncertainty, but it’s not impossible,” the former Circuit Court judge said. “Obviously money is important to get the message out, but I think we’ll have the money to do that. All the money in the world can’t change what she’s already done and the opinion people have of her.”

Alex Sims, a senior adviser for Foxx’s re-election effort, said in a statement the campaign “acknowledges this challenging time and that individuals and families are facing new financial circumstances due to COVID-19.”

“Much of the Foxx campaign’s current efforts are going towards a ‘Good Neighbor’ program, offering wellness checks to our constituents, in partnership with Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky,” Sims said. “With a pivotal race ahead of her, the State’s Attorney is being cautious and thoughtful in her fundraising efforts as she pushes forward to November.”

Foxx’s campaign hasn’t reported any new campaign donations since the March primary. Four years ago, in the days immediately after the March 15 primary, Foxx reported nearly $75,000 in cash and in-kind contributions.

The bulk of that was a $40,000 gift from Foxx’s mentor and chair of the Cook County Democrats Toni Preckwinkle, who doubles as Cook County Board president.

The county party is also seeing its fundraising impacted by the pandemic.

Executive director Jacob Kaplan said the party is still “trying to figure out how to adapt to the new world we’re likely to be in for a while.”

Typically, Cook County Democrats hold a 500-person fundraiser in October, but no one knows if that will be held or how.

“There’s not a lot of answers at this point,” Kaplan said, adding that the party is exploring some options, including hosting the event virtually. “How do you book an event if you’re not sure if it’s possible?”

Despite the challenges, Kaplan says the party will “raise money one way or another.”

Campaigning will likely look different come fall — think more phone banking, mailings and virtual campaigning rather than door-to-door interactions or events.

Cook County Republican Chairman Sean Morrison pointed to Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s virtual rallies as a “symbol of the current political landscape across the country.”

“Right about now I would be having a spring fundraiser,” Morrison said. “It’s just tough. Nobody has the ability to go out and do anything. Our guidance to candidates has been pick up a phone, pick up the established donor list and make some phone calls.”

But given the state of the economy, Morrison said he doesn’t know “how loose the purse strings are going to be for down ballot races.”

Though Foxx will be able to raise funds from organized labor and special interests and largely rest on her name recognition, Morrison says O’Brien shouldn’t be discounted.

“He’ll get money,” Morrison said. “Even [coronavirus] aside, O’Brien has the best shot [to flip the State’s Attorney seat] in about a decade.”

As for Manny’s, owner-operator Dan Raskin said employees of the legendary deli are working “extra hard and differently to try to get business” during the pandemic.

Raskin hopes his family’s deli will be able to reopen ahead of the November primary — for both regular customers and politicians alike.

For now, candidates can “order their good luck corned beef sandwich, but they can’t eat it here.”",real

The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, but the families who endured the Civil War would see some parallels between their experiences and ours.

Indeed, social distancing has unintentionally made our society into something the Civil War generation would have recognized: one clearly based on the household.

Opinion

Maintaining the household was always the chief priority for 19th Century families, but the absence of many fathers, husbands and brothers on the Civil War battlefront made it an even more pressing responsibility. This empowered the women left behind, but it also created a sense of being cut off from the rest of the world — a feeling we can certainly relate to today.

Like us, they knew that monumental events were taking place and decisions were being made that could profoundly affect their lives. However, they had far fewer ways to learn about what was happening outside their immediate communities.

We benefit from a vast technological network designed to bring us information. This flood of data from competing sources can seem overwhelming and make us anxious about our constantly changing landscape. This anxiety would have been even greater for Civil War Americans, who similarly did not know what the crisis would bring but also had more trouble gathering even basic information about it.

Newspapers were their greatest conduit to the outside world, but details were sometimes slow to arrive. Knowing a battle had been fought often wasn’t enough because it didn’t address their main concern. That came later — with the casualty lists. Families could wait days, or even weeks, to discover if loved ones had fallen in combat. For some, due to the lack of forensic science, it took until the end of the war to see if Johnny came marching home.

So, like us, Civil War Americans often found themselves isolated and uncertain.

Fortunately, their households also provided them with distractions and other ways to alleviate those conditions. Without modern appliances and technology, running the household was a laborious task — even more so with some family members off at the front. Kids had other amusements too, like games and toys — some purchased, but others made for them by relatives and friends.

Middle class families also participated in “parlor culture.” They would gather in the parlor — a room set aside solely for cultural pursuits — and read together, sing songs and play piano, or do various other activities that interacted with the broader culture and enriched their minds. In fact, the war itself influenced many of these activities. People bought games that simulated aspects of the war and sang songs that helped emotionally and intellectually make sense of the conflict raging around them.

Households reached outward during the Civil War and tried to help however they could. Basic tasks like knitting had always been prominent features of home life but became something more. Women knitted socks and garments for soldiers, along with other supplies that could be manufactured in the home.

Soldier health also became a focus. Women volunteered as nurses and people gave financial support to national organizations designed to promote mental and physical health in the armies. Mary Lincoln herself visited hospitals to cheer patients, and both she and the president supported organizations that helped soldiers. We can see parallels between these efforts and ours to sew masks and donate gloves for healthcare providers or find other ways to help “flatten the curve.”

Civil War families also provided psychological comfort to their loved ones in the ranks by constantly writing letters and sending care packages. They may not have had the internet or phones, but it’s not difficult to envision this flood of letters — many of which remain with us today in repositories like the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library — as akin to text messages and emails.

For some families, the quantity of these letters far outstripped anything else they sent in their lifetimes — something we can also identify with, as social distancing motivates us to reach out via technology to family and friends we sometimes took for granted.

Human beings crave community and, even in the most trying of times, seek it out. Each Civil War household was a community unto itself, but members of those households also found ways to connect themselves with the broader community around them. Our crisis is of a different sort, but we can find inspiration and comfort in the sacrifices they made and the ingenuity they showed.

1382,1371,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/18/sea-sleaze-inside-underground-market-coronavirus-masks/,2020-05-18,"‘No offense, but is this a joke?’ Inside the underground market for face masks.","The international market for desperately needed medical masks is riddled with fraud. Up and down the supply chain, from factories to hospitals, opportunists are benefiting from the chaotic market as prices have quintupled. Rampant price gouging and fraud has provoked dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of cease-and-desist orders, from major mask manufacturers as well as state attorneys general.



While profiteers and crooks make their fortunes, medical workers across the United States are rationing masks, recycling them and treating infected patients without them. The federal government has taken steps to address the shortages, but emergency management experts say the efforts were distressingly inadequate. The Trump administration ignored early warnings that it needed to shore up its stockpile of masks and other personal protective equipment and has fallen behind several other Western nations in the race to secure them, documents and interviews show.



Current and former government officials interviewed by The Washington Post say the most powerful country in the world should not have suffered from shortages of a basic, low-tech product.

“The lack of preparation and coordination has been appalling,” said Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who has advised Republican and Democratic administrations on planning for a pandemic.



“In past disasters, the federal government, with its enormous buying power, took the lead in procurement,” he said. “This time, federal inaction forced states into competing with each other for these scarce products. ”

Canada moved more quickly to manage the crisis. Early on, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau focused on the logistics of shipping and manufacturing. He assigned a team to develop a plan to expand domestic manufacturing of masks and immediately obtain supplies from the world’s largest producer of PPE: China. Canada’s mask procurement operation has not been problem-free — some large orders have fallen through or not passed muster with inspectors — but overall the country achieved faster and better results than the United States.



U.S. government efforts to procure masks hit another setback last week, when the Food and Drug Administration partly reversed course on an initiative designed to increase availability. Since April 3, it had been allowing a class of Chinese-made masks to be imported for hospital use despite not meeting previous U.S. regulatory standards. On Thursday, the FDA sharply cut the number of Chinese manufacturers cleared for import after finding that some masks did not provide the promised protection. The reversal has sown confusion among the Chinese manufacturers on which the United States depends for key supplies.



“This is an unprecedented pandemic and while the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,” agency spokeswoman Brittney Manchester wrote in an email.

The federal government’s long-standing estimate is that the United States needs 3.5 billion masks to respond to a serious pandemic. As of May 7, according to the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the private sector had either “coordinated the delivery of or are currently shipping” 86.1 million N95 respirators. The government has lined up contracts to obtain another 600 million masks in the coming months, partly from U.S. manufacturers — such as Honeywell and 3M — that have ramped up domestic factory production.



The administration’s most touted program to ship protective gear, Project Airbridge, has distributed just 768,000 N95 masks, according to a recent Post analysis of the latest FEMA records.



While some states and cities report improved stocks of medical masks, many areas in the United States remain dangerously short of what’s needed, according to interviews with state officials, nurses and other front-line providers.

President Trump recently disputed such accounts, including one nurse’s complaint of “sporadic” supplies of medical masks, telling nurses gathered May 6 in the Oval Office, “I’ve heard we have tremendous supply to almost all places.”

‘Sea of sleaze’

As the virus spread through parts of China in January, Wong searched fruitlessly in Hong Kong for masks for her young children. That’s when she saw a potential business opportunity.





Wong has worked in the high-stakes San Francisco real estate market and launched an Asia-based tech start-up. She knows the political contours on both sides of the Pacific. But she says she’s never faced a more dicey business than dealing in masks during a pandemic.

Her description of a daily dilemma to sort out legitimate deals from scams illustrates what U.S. states and hospitals encounter as they seek relatively small shipments of masks. Wong did not provide records documenting her volume of deliveries, but The Post confirmed at least two successful deals, including one with a Louisiana-based hospital chain. A review of business and court records in San Francisco shows that Wong built a sizable real estate business over the past decade, one that attracted civil lawsuits against her company and occasional liens for failure to pay taxes and franchise fees.

To secure mask contracts, Wong lines up buyers and sellers in a market that involves proof of funds on one side and proof of product on the other. Money goes into escrow accounts, while in-person or video evidence jokingly known as “proof of life” inspections are carried out to make sure the product really exists.





Much of that is normal in international trade. What is unusual, Wong said, is how much fraud there is.

“Imagine what it’s like to navigate this sea of sleaze to get people the masks they need,” she said.

Of all the potential mask buyers and sellers with whom she has come in contact, Wong estimates that less than 20 percent are real. Escrow provides some sanity: The buyer’s money goes into an account controlled by an independent agent and is only released when the transaction is confirmed.

But before that happens, Wong says she has to identify what’s real and what isn’t. She regularly sees sophisticated forgery of financial documents and even videos of fake caches of masks. She provided examples to The Post that reflected forged financial statements from banks including Chase and PNC with balances ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to $3 billion.





Federal investigators have already charged a mask seller in the United States for wire fraud. On April 10 in Atlanta, federal authorities arrested and charged Christopher Parris, a 39-year-old businessman, after he offered to sell the Department of Veterans Affairs 125 million N95 masks. An affidavit filed by a federal special agent in the case states the businessman’s credentials were suspect and the masks, as it turned out, didn’t exist. Parris could not be reached and the attorney who represented him in a separate case in Rochester, N.Y., did not respond to a request for comment.

50 states of chaos

Several dozen state and local government officials, hospital executives and medical supply brokers interviewed by The Post in recent weeks echoed Wong’s account, describing a process riddled with lies.





Andy Beshear, a Democrat, had been serving as Kentucky’s governor for just a few months when the novel coronavirus hit his state. Beshear began holding 5 p.m. briefings each weekday, sometimes appealing for donations of personal protective equipment.

“This is a Breeders’ Cup of PPE,” he said in April, using a thoroughbred racing analogy to describe a recent mask donation. “It comes from Kentuckians, knowing what we’re fighting is the challenge of our lifetime and giving up the supplies that they have. It is the selfless, we’re-all-in-it-together attitude that we are seeing from everybody.”

In an interview, Beshear said his duty is to his own constituents first. “If I have to compete with other states, I will compete with other states.”

The mask shortage has been one of his most difficult challenges during the pandemic, though the state now has enough to expand testing significantly.



At one point, Kentucky paid $8.60 a piece on an order of 1,000 N95s, a number that wouldn’t supply an average hospital for long.

The governor said he has competed with the federal government at times.

He recounted one incident where a company informed his aides that FEMA had rerouted Kentucky’s shipment of N95 masks. “They were diverted to one of the hot spots. I can’t argue with that, but it did add to our challenge.”

“Our hospitals are securing enough to get by, though our nursing homes are struggling,” he said. “The costs that we’re having to pay are outrageous, but at the same time, this a hundred-year pandemic.”

The same problems are filtering down to local governments across the country. Andrew Hime, a purchasing agent for Maryland’s Anne Arundel County, says he has been forced to navigate the treacherous foreign markets — an unfamiliar assignment for a local official.

“There are people we’ve never dealt with before, and we’re going to pay five times the normal price,” he said. “But they’re the only folks who are telling me that they can get product at a certain date.”

Before the crisis, top quality N95 masks traded for about a dollar apiece, but those days are gone as global demand has shot way past supply. Hime says he is bombarded with offers that are steadily getting more expensive.

Among a bevy of promotional fliers is one decorated with a fuchsia-colored banner from Ontario-based Vanguard Pharma offering N95s for $6.30 each in mid-April. The company advertises itself on its website as “salesforce solutions” for the pharmaceutical industry but says nothing about sales of masks or other protective equipment.

Canadian antitrust lawyer Antonio Di Domenico, an expert in price-gouging laws, said that such markups could be a problem. The U.S. leading manufacturer of medical masks, 3M, says it has not changed the price it charges for the masks as a result of the pandemic.

“To the extent that companies are retailing N95 masks for large multiples over 3M’s list price — and there is evidence that their costs associated with bringing them to market do not justify the markup — then they could be exposed to prosecution under Ontario’s recently enacted price-gouging measures,” Di Domenico said.

Executives from Vanguard Pharma did not return emails, calls or texts seeking comment this week.

Even a state behemoth like California has been beset by problems as it sought to obtain masks. On Monday, state officials were grilled by California State Assembly oversight committee looking into several troubled masks deals. The questions focused on the state’s decision in March to buy 100 million N95 masks from a new supplier, Blue Flame Medical. The state of Maryland terminated a contract earlier this month with Blue Flame after state officials said it failed to deliver on a $12.5 million contract for masks and other equipment.

A lawyer for Blue Flame said the company was acting in good faith in its dealings with California, Maryland and other clients.

In California, legislators wanted to know why the state contracted for such a huge number of masks with a company that had no track record. The state halted the contract and got an immediate refund after receiving a warning from Blue Flame’s bank.

“The sense of urgency and panic, trying to get supplies, rushing to compete with the federal government and other states, created the need for expediency,” the state’s treasurer, Fiona Ma, told legislators at the hearing.

California has also ordered 375 million N95s from BYD Precision Manufacture that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined this month did not meet all of its certifications. The firm has described the problems as “easily fixable,” and the state won’t have to pay until the masks win federal approval.

At every level, government officials are also having to find ways to filter out the crooks, gougers and incompetent players who have moved to take advantage of the crisis.

“It’s all taken a rhythm in government that government ain’t used to,” said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D). Even now, he would welcome federal officials stepping in to make mass purchases. “But we can’t rely on the federal government.”

HHS officials were warned about this potential shortfall in late January, when one of America’s major mask manufacturers emailed former HHS official Rick Bright, offering to open the company’s closed factories to boost domestic production of masks. While Bright warned department officials of the need to rebuild the stockpile, according to a whistleblower complaint, no one took Prestige Ameritech chief executive Mike Bowen up on his offer.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) said in an interview that the warnings the administration received in January to bolster the nation’s stockpile amounted to “a flashing red light.”

“Words are inadequate to describe the inaction,” he said. “So much of this was preventable. It did not have to happen this way.”

‘Is this a joke?’

In mid-March, a White House task force assembled by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and staffed by inexperienced volunteers began vetting potential suppliers to import masks from abroad.

In an email exchange from late March obtained by The Post, an executive at an Australian trading company expressed bewilderment to one of the volunteers about the administration’s informal and disjointed approach to entrust such a critical mission to a group of novices. The Post withheld the names of the people in the correspondence as a condition of describing the email exchange.

The executive, who is a U.S.-based American citizen, was working with the task force to help the State Department navigate the supply chain and source masks from a factory in China.

“I am a volunteer working on the White House Task Force combating COVID-19,” the task force member wrote to the executive. “We’ve been doing this for a while now and have outlined a process to make everything move smoothly.”

The task force member outlined a multistep process and included a link to a U.S. procurement website. He said the team would require an inspection of the factory to proceed.

“No offense, but is this a joke?” the executive replied. “The world is burning down, you guys are volunteers, who is coordinating this? Volunteers?”

The executive warned that the United States was already behind in the race to secure masks.

“People are dying,” he wrote. “Let’s fix this.”

Kushner’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the email exchange, though the White House senior adviser has defended his volunteers in a statement. “The bottom line is that this program sourced tens of millions of masks and essential PPE in record time and Americans who needed ventilators received ventilators,” Kushner said. “These volunteers are true patriots.”

By the time the task force started reaching out to find new suppliers of N95 masks, it may have already been too late for the United States to make a big move.

Christopher Kirchhoff, who was director for strategic planning on the National Security Council in the Obama administration, says there were two ways to make sure the United States had enough critical supplies to handle the crisis.

“Use the free market. Or use the federal departments whose mission it is to source and allocate scarce resources in a public emergency.”

Trump has been reluctant to make broad use of federal power, such as invoking the Defense Production Act, the Korean War-era statute that gives presidents the authority over factories and supply chains to secure critical equipment.

The shortage has forced American hospitals, fire departments and paramedics into agonizing choices this spring to not resuscitate infected patients who go into cardiac arrest because of concern for medical staff members.

Trump briefly invoked the Defense Production Act, requiring 3M to cease delivering masks to foreign buyers who had contracted for them. But the president’s instructions were later changed in part because of concerns it could result in retaliatory action against the United States.

While the Trump administration left much of the heavy lifting to the states, other countries had a national strategy. The government of France alone has bought 2 billion face masks, including 400 million N95s.

In an interview, Kieke Okma, a former Dutch health official, said that because of their centralized medical systems, European countries, including her own, already have systems in place to buy and distribute medical equipment in bulk for hospitals.

In Canada, government and private sector officials said this week that their own shortage of N95 masks had largely been resolved, at least for now.

The short-term effort was led in part by Canadian diplomats and consultants in Beijing and Shanghai who developed connections to manufacturers. The Canadians then leased warehouse facilities in China to be sure that the acquired masks were secure before they passed through customs on their way to Canada.

In Ottawa, Trudeau’s government asked the country’s two major airlines to set up an air bridge bringing supplies quickly into the country. Once the masks arrived, federal officials worked with provincial leaders to distribute them where they were most urgently needed, Canadian officials said.

The country also fought gouging aggressively. As the pandemic spread, two provinces passed new laws against the practice, and others encouraged more aggressive enforcement of existing laws.

Canada may also have benefited from relatively calm diplomatic relations with China as tensions were spiking with the United States.

Kirchhoff, who in 2016 wrote a White House paper on lessons learned from the Ebola epidemic, says the Trump administration missed an opportunity to alleviate the shortages with bold, early action.

“This administration’s response introduced chaos precisely because it did not mobilize the federal machinery it alone commands‚” he said.",real

How to support restaurants, cafes and bars that have closed

Many eateries have been forced to reduce or close operations due to the outbreak. If you want to support your local restaurant, consider ordering takeout or purchasing a gift card or merchandise.

“Gift cards are like interest-free loans,” San Antonio restaurant owner Steve McHugh told The Washington Post. Having some income from the gift cards could help a restaurant get back up and running again, says Edouardo Jordan, a James Beard-award-winning chef.

You also may consider supporting servers and other workers who have been laid off by donating to a fund or nonprofit, such as the Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation, mentioned above. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a nonprofit organization serving restaurant workers, recently launched a campaign to raise $500,000 for a disaster relief fund. You can also look for workers relief funds that may have been set up in your area.

How to help seniors who are at risk

Older people are among the most vulnerable to complications from coronavirus. If you know someone who is elderly and at home, consider checking in and asking if you can help shop and deliver groceries on their behalf.

If you have a loved one who lives in a facility, respect rules the facility may have in place, including barring visitors. Deborah Dunn, president of the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, says a lockdown is standard protocol for many facilities during flu season and can help shield residents from potential exposure.

How to help ‘flatten the curve’

One of the most important things you can do to help is protect yourself and others. Prevent the spread of the illness by practicing the CDC’s recommended guidance: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public area or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Don’t forget to moisturize.

If there has been a coronavirus case in your community, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings and close contact with others. Yes, social distancing is difficult — and against our very nature — but it can be crucial to “flattening the curve” and slowing transmission of the virus. There are reasons the CDC recommended a nationwide halt to gatherings of 50 people or more and a federal coronavirus task force recommended no gatherings of more than 10. Local governments are canceling large events and ordering restaurants and bars to stop on-site services. These are all efforts to prevent an onslaught of ill people from overwhelming the limited resources of the health-care system.

“The idea is that the sooner you stop that transmission chain, you are actually limiting an exponential growth,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, told The Post. “That’s really important, because instead of preventing 1,000 cases, you might be preventing 100,000 cases — and a matter of days can make a difference.”

The CDC also recommends wearing face coverings in public, especially in places where social distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores, and areas with high rates of community transition. Here’s a guide on how to sew your own fabric mask. Just remember that social distancing still remains an important preventive measure.

How to help at stores

Public health officials have stated this over and over: Please do not buy an N-95 respirator or surgical mask unless you absolutely need it. Widespread panic-buying can deplete the supply of protective equipment needed for health-care workers. Because of mask shortages, groups have created websites with crowdsourced suggestions on how to donate unused protective equipment to hospitals or medical centers.

Similarly, be mindful about how many groceries you buy. If you can afford to, buy enough for at least two to three weeks but don’t take everything off the shelves. If you are older, have chronic health conditions or otherwise at higher risk for complications from the virus, consider having someone else shop for you or getting groceries delivered.

“Because everybody is panicking, there are a lot of people in the grocery stores, so if you belong in that group of people who are 65 or older, or immune compromised, then it is best to get someone else to shop for you, if you can,” said Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York.

Some grocery stores have offered limited hours for those who are older.

How to help pets and shelters

Local animal shelters and rescue groups across the country are reducing services and canceling fundraisers to protect staff but still need to care for their animals. The Humane Society of the United States suggests helping by adopting or fostering a pet, which will reduce the strain on shelters. The Best Friends Animal Society has a site where you can search for partner organizations near you.

Some shelters also offer pet support services for low-wage families who may not be able to afford caring for their pet. Check with your local shelter to see if there are ways you can donate or help.

The Humane Rescue Alliance suggests checking in with people in your community, especially seniors or those with underlying health issues, and offering to walk their dogs or help with pet food.

1398,1593,https://news.yahoo.com/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-studies-side-effects-160139167.html,2020-05-20,Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: Everything to know about the drug Trump says he's taking,"The debate over the use of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible prevention method or treatment for COVID-19 was reignited Monday after President Donald Trump said he's been taking the drug for about a week and a half.

Scientists, journalists and politicians were quick to criticize the president, pointing out the drug's ineffectiveness against the coronavirus in a few recent studies and long list of potentially dangerous side effects.

Multiple government agencies have warned against the improper use of hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, yet the president has been touting the drug since early April often relying on anecdotal evidence for his arguments.

""You'd be surprised about how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it,"" Trump said.

So what have we learned about hydroxychloroquine since it was first mentioned during the pandemic weeks ago? Here's everything you need to know.

What is hydroxychloroquine? What is it used for?

Hydroxychloroquine is an arthritis medicine that can also be used as a prevention or treatment of malaria, a red blood cell infection transmitted by a mosquito bite, according to the Mayo Clinic. It’s available in the U.S. under prescription only.

In addition to malaria, the drug can also be used to treat acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The Johns Hopkins Lupus Center said it can help control lupus by decreasing the immune system’s activity without predisposing it to infection. It can also protect against UV light and sometimes even improve skin lesions that don't respond to ointments.

Hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name Plaquenil.

What are the side effects of taking it?

Another reason why experts are cautious about using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 is because of its numerous side effects.

""It may also be worth noting that there are over 40 side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine dosage. These include dry cough, hoarseness, fever, difficulty breathing and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmia,"" said John Scott, chair of the department of pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

The long list of common side effects of Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps, loss of appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, dizziness, spinning sensation, headache, ringing in your ears, nervousness, irritability, skin rash, itching or hair loss.

The Mayo Clinic urges patients to contact their doctor if they experience any serious side effects, such as muscle weakness, twitching, uncontrolled movement, loss of balance or coordination, blurred vision, light sensitivity, seeing halos around lights, pale skin, easy bruising or bleeding, confusion, unusual thoughts or behavior, or seizures.

Nancy Pelosi: Trump is 'morbidly obese' and should not take hydroxychloroquine

Can hydroxychloroquine prevent or treat the coronavirus?

Two recent observational studies of COVID-19 patients suggested the drug has little impact in treating the disease. The studies, while not the same as a clinical trial, suggested that the drug did not significantly reduce complications from the virus or death.

A study posted on April 23 involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Veterans Health Administration medical centers found there were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those receiving standard care. In addition, the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week. It is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus.

In a statement on the N.I.H. website about the study, Dr. Anthony Fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people, ""we need solid data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes.""",real

On the night of March 30, just before 7 p.m., Dr. Ray Lorenzoni put on his face mask, walked across the street from the Bronx apartment he shares with his wife and started his shift at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center.

Lorenzoni, 35, is in his second year of a pediatric cardiology fellowship at the hospital. But this night, the patients would be different: It was his first shift treating adult coronavirus patients — the first adults he's treated in the hospital since medical school six years before.

""Coming into the hospital, it was a little bit unreal,"" he says. ""The whole floor was filled with adult patients.""

By then, COVID-19 cases systemwide at Montefiore Medical Center had gone from just two cases a little over two weeks earlier to more than 700. In response, Montefiore transformed part of the children's hospital into a 40-bed adult COVID unit. All around the city, other hospitals were making similar adjustments. Medical students graduated early. Operating rooms were converted into ICUs. A field hospital went up in Central Park.

But the surge in New York City has done much more than simply rearrange space and upend protocol. More than 15,000 people have died of COVID-19 there, and that enormous toll will profoundly impact the city's tens of thousands of health care workers for years to come. Lorenzoni is one of them.

A little over a month ago, Lorenzoni answered a request from NPR for hospital workers to describe what work was like at the epicenter of the crisis. Lorenzoni began recording his reflections for NPR after his shifts, sitting at the desk in his bedroom, speaking into his iPhone in a slow, measured voice.

Just a few weeks earlier, Lorenzoni had watched — along with many other Americans — how the Italian medical system had been brought to its knees. It seemed likely it was only a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus would arrive in the U.S. And of course, by then, it already had.

""I knew I could be involved because of what happened in Italy,"" Lorenzoni says, and adds, ""a pediatric physician needing to take care of critical adult patients is unheard of.""

Still, he was surprised he was recruited so early.

""They filled us up pretty quickly and the patients were very sick. I remember in the first couple shifts we were putting breathing tubes in patients on a floor that doesn't usually do that,"" he says.

Treating adults hit him hard, he says. He's used to working with kids.

""Pediatrics is a career where most of your patients get better,"" he says. ""But these were very with-it adults who were scared. They knew what the risk was.""

It felt important to him, he says, to be honest about what was happening, even when the news wasn't good.

""One of my main mantras is to sit down with somebody. And that was very tough in this environment because our protective equipment didn't surround us,"" he says. ""So we were discouraged from sitting down on the bed next to a patient to have a deep discussion or sitting down in a chair and being at eye level with the patient.""

Instead, he says he would do his best to give his patient a sense of comfort by leaning against the wall, trying not to stand over or talk down to them.

""I think patients can see right through a physician when they try to dance around a difficult conversation,"" he says. ""You can be honest with a person and they appreciate that honesty.""

One patient, a man in his mid-forties, kept asking how bad his condition was. As the man's health deteriorated, Lorenzoni was open with him, aware that those hard conversations — like what it means to be put on a ventilator — are sometimes the last a patient will ever have.

""I remember that he asked me, 'doc, I know I'm not getting better, what else can we do?' and unfortunately I had to answer that we'd been doing everything we could. And he broke down. And I broke down a little bit in tears,"" he says.

In his recordings, Lorenzoni lingered on the quieter moments. He spoke about why it was important to take time with his patients, especially because visitors were not allowed. One woman, in her early 30s, often wanted staff to check in on her, beyond the usual rounds that doctors and nurses make.

""I feel like she knew she wasn't doing well, and she wanted the company,"" Lorenzoni says.

When he would leave for the day, he'd check in on her to make sure she was okay, but he worried that she would take a turn for the worse by the time he returned.

Eventually, that's what happened. She needed to be placed on a ventilator to breathe.

""One of the things I remember before the breathing tube was placed was simply sitting by her side and telling her what was going to happen. And what we could and couldn't do to help,"" he remembers. ""She was scared about how little control she had or even the doctors had in how she did.""

Lorenzoni transferred her to an ICU, an operating room that had been converted. His shift was ending, and he signed out his other patients, but he stayed on to be with this one during the intubation.

""When her body didn't respond well to that, because it was so weak, I was there doing chest compressions on her,"" he says. ""And I signed her death certificate afterwards. It was a tough day.""

She was the first of his patients to die.

""Although she passed away without her family by her side, she wasn't alone,"" he says. ""I hope that even this small amount of company that she had at the end was comforting for her. And it's going to be one of the things that sticks with me for the rest of my career.""

Many of the people who have died from COVID-19 in New York had underlying health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, and that's true in Lorenzoni's experience as well. But he says conditions that put someone at a higher risk are much more common than people realize.

""These are people that we know. These are people that we're related to,"" he says. ""It's either yourself, or your neighbor, or people that you work with.""

Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been decreasing for a few weeks now in New York, and Lorenzoni is back on pediatrics. It's a welcome relief for now, but he says if there's another surge, he could be called back.",real

Restructuring firm KPMG said on Tuesday it had been appointed administrator to the 106-year old brand, which operates 18 retail stores and one concession outlet.

It also sells via its own website, through Amazon and wholesales to several large retail chains across the United Kingdom. It also has third party licence deals in Australia and Asia.

KPMG has already made 164 of Antler’s 199 workforce redundant.

“Although the business was trading well prior to the virus outbreak, restrictions imposed at the start of the lockdown period prompted the closure of Antler’s retail and wholesale outlets, while the impact on international travel has also significantly affected sales,” said Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator.

“With uncertainty over the lifting of travel restrictions placing further financial strain on the business, the directors concluded that they had no option but to appoint administrators.”

KPMG will continue to trade the business via its online channels while it assesses options for the brand.",real

Lala, she thought, would be company. But she’s turned out to be so much more.

“Being alone at home kind of is hard,” says George, “but with a pet you have someone to take care of, someone to play with you, someone to greet you in the morning, so it’s kind of like really calming and comforting.”

Whether it’s a dog, a cat or, yes, a hedgehog named Quillie Nelson, pets are proving to be unexpected heroes in lockdown. They include the newly adopted and fostered like Lala; people have flooded shelters, looking for pets to fill their extra hours at home.

Laura Evans, her husband and their three kids brought 12-week-old Zoe to their Bethesda, Maryland, home after the pandemic hit. The squirmy Yorkshire terrier needs constant attention, and they’re happy to oblige.

“We wanted to bring a little light and life to our house,” Evans said. “She’s a cuddly work, homework sidekick. Everyone wants to hang with her.”

Nancy Karan said her pet Shadow gets her out of her New York apartment for quality time with her fellow dog walkers, at a safe distance. At night they sleep together, “because it’s very comforting just to have his body on my bed.”

In Houston, Quillie Nelson and other pets help maintain routines for Rachael Pavlik and two teens.

“I think having pets during a scary time like this is good for the whole family. It’s good for the kids to have a sense of normalcy and a sense of responsibility, like they have to get out of bed before noon to feed their animals,” she said.

Kitty Block, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, urged more people to foster and adopt as the health crisis worsens.

“It frees up space in the shelter to take these animals in that may be displaced because their family member, their owner is ill or financially in a troubled situation,” she said.

While many people seek comfort, some frustrations have surfaced with all the togetherness. Professional dog trainer Nicole Ellis in Los Angeles, of the service Rover.com, said owners should make a conscious effort to tire out their animals before a Zoom meeting or important phone call.

“We can’t blame them if they’re like, ‘I’m bored! I’m bored!’ and they haven’t done anything all day. It’s not their fault,” she said.

That doesn’t seem to be a problem for Squiggles, a bearded dragon in South Orange, New Jersey. Dan Cohen’s 13-year-old daughter, Julia, has survived with help from her chill lizard, who has her own emotional support vest and tiny mask.

“We don’t want her catching coronavirus,” he joked.

Aubrey Fine, a licensed psychologist and professor emeritus at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona said the relationship is mutually beneficial between humans and animals.

“In a time of tremendous and unique life challenges, goodness is still around us. When you’re looking at souls, animals touch human souls and humans touch animal souls. And together serendipity can happen.”",real

She started couples counseling with her husband in February, just before the coronavirus began to spread throughout the US.

Although they were hesitant at first to switch to virtual meetings, the weekly sessions soon began inspiring huge improvements in how Petro and her husband were communicating every day.

If you are quarantining or working from home with your partner, and are starting to get on each other's nerves, Petro recommends looking into couples therapy — it can be more impactful now than ever.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

My husband and I started couples counseling at the end of February, when coronavirus had yet to be widely detected in the US. Becoming parents had tested our relationship, and recent challenges in particular — including the arrival of our second baby this past December — had made existing tensions worse. We wanted to communicate better, to treat one another more lovingly and bicker less often, particularly in front of our two year old son, who — much to my heartbreak — had begun acting out when the two of us would start fighting.

Arran and I were three sessions in and things were going well when the public health crisis escalated. As New Yorkers, we were encouraged to practice social distancing and began sheltering in place. We pulled our son out of daycare, and my husband began to work remotely. Thankfully, we've relocated to a spacious house upstate, rather than our 600-foot apartment. Even so, it's been an emotional rollercoaster. Like most Americans, we're stressed about money. We take turns feeling anxious and fearful. We're sometimes at odds when it comes to parenting our rambunctious toddler. Even though we all love to spend time together, we definitely get on one another's nerves.

While the midst of a deadly pandemic may feel like the wrong time to be working on your #couplesgoals, experts are clear in their advice that now is not the time to stop taking actions that address your mental health — and when it comes to interventions like couples or family therapy, it might even be a great time to start.",real

It might sound like some kind of crazy sci-fi flick, but hear us out. Back in late April when New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was asked about what happens after a person is tested for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and whether the results “automatically go into some kind of database,” this was Cuomo’s chilling response:

“Yes, your result will be logged into both a state and county database through an electronic lab reporting system. The database includes your name.”

When further pressed about what a positive test result entails from the government’s standpoint, Cuomo explained that all newly infected are being ordered by their county health departments to quarantine for 14 days from the time of their most recent symptoms. They are also being asked to procure the names of anyone they may have come into contact with so that they, too, can be told to quarantine.

This directly ties into the contact tracing push from people like Bill and Hillary Clinton, who want an “army of contact tracers” to sweep the nation and hunt down anyone who might have been infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Be sure to listen to the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Judy Mikovits about these and other authoritarian measures being thrown at the people in response to this “plandemic:”

WHO official: A vaccine for coronavirus may never arrive

In addition to the typical swabbing protocol, another form of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) testing apparently involves taking blood samples by pricking people’s fingers, which the federal government is now implementing at pharmacies across America.

This combination of collecting both saliva and blood would seem to suggest that dark forces are perhaps trying to profile people’s genomes for some other purpose besides keeping them “safe” from a virus.

Keep in mind that there may never even be a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least according to Dr. David Nabarro from the WHO, a professor of global health at Imperial College London.

As it turns out, it is quite difficult to produce an effective vaccine for a virus, let alone one that continues to mutate and basically become new viruses. If a vaccine is, in fact, released, chances are it will not be effective nor will it be safe.

“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” Nabarro is quoted as saying. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”

Without a vaccine, experts are automatically predicting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will never go away and instead become an annual event. And they are saying this while completely ignoring nutrition, supplementation, and other lifestyle changes that could easily protect the masses at a minimal cost.

“It’s absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,” Nabarro says.

The problem is that no one can say for sure what the test results mean.

Despite a proliferation of COVID-19 antibody tests that are now available, having been churned out hastily under emergency conditions, the science that will help explain whether the antibodies offer future immunity isn’t there yet.

And a recent examination by some of the nation’s top scientists found unacceptably high rates of false positives in some antibody tests, calling into question their usefulness.

As more states inch toward reopening their economies, experts caution that antibody tests are just one tool and an imperfect one at that.

“It’s very early. We need to do so much more work,” says Dr. Mary K. Hayden, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Rush University Medical College and spokeswoman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Antibody tests are different from the molecular nasal swab tests used to detect the presence of live coronavirus in an infected person.

The antibody test takes a small amount of blood to look for the presence of antibodies produced by the body’s immune system in response to an infection. With COVID-19, antibodies usually appear a week or more after the onset of symptoms.

Much hope has been placed on antibody tests, on the theory that knowing whether people have been infected in the past might show whether they have enough immunity to safely return to work or school. The results also potentially could show who is qualified to donate blood for convalescent plasma, which is being used investigationally on very ill patients.

There are several concerns, though. The first is accuracy. The majority of antibody tests were manufactured without approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration, which offered “regulatory flexibility” for test developers due to the pandemic.

While swab tests used to diagnose live virus must have an “Emergency Use Authorization” from the FDA, only a handful of antibody tests have made it through that process.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, who chairs a House panel investigating whether the antibody tests work as advertised, has urged the FDA to better police the test-kit manufacturers and pull faulty tests from the market.

The FDA has said the National Institutes of Health will evaluate the tests.

The COVID-19 Testing Project — a joint effort of the University of California-San Francisco, University of California-Berkeley, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and the Innovative Genomics Institute — tested 14 coronavirus antibody tests and found that only one delivered no false-positive results, meaning it never detected antibodies in someone who was never infected.

Two others came close, delivering no false positives nearly 99% of the time.

The 11 other tests did not fare as well. Four had false-positive rates ranging from 11% to 16%, and many of the others were around 5%.

Even the three highly accurate tests gave false-negatives about 10% of the time, which means some people who had been exposed to the virus weren’t flagged by the tests.

Poor quality tests could have huge implications if large numbers of people were told they had survived an infection of COVID-19 when they actually had never been exposed to the virus.

Getting a false positive reading 10% of the time or more “definitely I would consider unacceptable,” says Patrick Hsu, a bioengineering professor at UC-Berkeley who is helping lead the COVID-19 Testing Project.

Hsu says he was intrigued by the tests, with at least 150 now available and consumers eager to be tested. “Yet these had not been rigorously or systematically evaluated,” he says.

Even if an antibody test is accurate, no one knows what a positive result means beyond confirming past exposure to the virus. Whether it might give you immunity in the same way that, say, having had chicken pox against getting that disease again does hasn’t been shown.

Experts at Johns Hopkins University caution that “antibody levels have not been correlated with immunity” and that, “while people who have been infected are presumed to have some immunity, it is unclear how much and for how long.”

The World Health Organization says, “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.”

Scientists also are trying to figure out whether people who’ve had a really bad illness with COVID-19 produce more antibodies than those who’ve had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.

The notion that a positive antibody test gives someone an “immunity passport” to resume normal life is dangerous, according to Hsu, who says, “There are a lot of unknowns here.”

For now, antibody tests are more useful in giving a wide-lens look at where the virus already has swept through and where it has yet to arrive, Hayden says.

A large-scale testing program could be used to compare geographic communities or population groups with each other, providing they were “apples-to-apples” comparisons, Hayden says.

More testing also could help pin down more accurate death rates.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NIH have announced plans for testing.

Accuracy is important because, in communities where the coronavirus hasn’t heavily penetrated, false positives would make up a greater proportion of all the positive results and might even outnumber the true positives.

The bottom line: Antibody tests aren’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for antsy people hoping to get back to their old lives.

But it’s not all doom and gloom, Hayden says.

Besides working to understand how the coronavirus antibodies function and refining the tests, scientists are developing tests that could detect viral antigens, which would be another way to catch infectious patients at an early stage. They’re also working on a vaccine and testing drugs.

“Four months ago, we didn’t even know this virus existed,” Hayden says, noting the fast progress scientists have made. “But we have a lot to do and a lot to learn.”",real

Premier League players are allowed to return to training from Tuesday after clubs agreed to allow “small group” sessions, with a possible resumption of normal ‘contact’ training next week.

Deeney, 31, said last week he would not put his family at risk.

“We’re due back in this week. I’ve said I’m not going in,” he told a podcast with boxing promoter Eddie Hearn and former WBC cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew.

“My son is five months and he’s had breathing difficulties. I don’t want to come home to put him in more danger. You’ve got to drive in in your own kit, you can’t have showers, then you’ve got to drive back home in the same dirty kit you’ve got.”

Britain’s statistics office said this month that black men are 4.2 times more likely to die from COVID-19-related causes than white males.

About a third of Premier League players are from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background.

“While we are getting tested and while we are going to be in a very safe environment, it only takes one person to get infected within the group. I don’t want to be bringing that home,” said Deeney.

“I can’t get a haircut until mid-July, but I can go and get in a box with 19 people and jump for a header. I don’t know how that works. No one could answer the questions, not because they didn’t want to, just because they don’t know the information.”

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

The 35-year-old was filmed arriving at the Turin club’s Continassa training ground in a black car and was due to undergo a medical before joining coach Maurizio Sarri and his team mates.

Ronaldo flew back to his native Madeira after Juventus beat Inter Milan 2-0 behind closed doors on March 8, their final game before Serie A was suspended because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

He returned to Turin in a private jet earlier this month but then had to spend two weeks at home under Italy’s quarantine rules.

Serie A clubs returned to training on May 4 but are restricted to training in small groups and must respect social distancing guidelines.

The government is still deliberating on whether to allow Serie A to restart but said on Monday that it would not happen before at least June 14, one day after the league had hoped to begin.

The squad is still without forward Gonzalo Higuain who only returned to Italy from Argentina last Thursday and must spend another 10 days in quarantine.",real

Downing Street confirmed on Saturday that Cummings had undertaken the seemingly flagrant lockdown-breaching journey from London to Durham in March, after news of it broke on Friday night.

In a tortured statement, Number 10 contended that, because Cummings’ wife was displaying coronavirus symptoms, the adviser had not broken the guidelines he’d helped to create because it was essential that his young son was looked after by his (Cummings’) elderly parents.

The claim has been met with confusion and anger in the UK as millions of mothers and fathers ask why they were told to keep their children away from their grandparents for more than two months.

Also on rt.com BBC blasted after political editor jumps to defend PM adviser Cummings following cross-country lockdown breach

The government’s claim appears to hold little water for Durham’s police chief as he slammed Cummings’ actions as ""most unwise"" and “concerning.”

“Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the Government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise,” acting Durham police commissioner Steve White said in a statement on Saturday.

To beat this crisis, we need to be selfless as millions have been. The response by the people of County Durham and Darlington have been exemplary, which makes this most frustrating and concerning.

The BBC has also come under fire for its reporting of the fiasco, with political editor Laura Kuenssberg accused of acting as a spokesperson for the government.

Last month, California made headlines when it announced a first-in-the-nation plan to create a $125m coronavirus relief fund for undocumented workers. But its rollout got off to a chaotic start this week, with thousands of calls flooding phone lines, creating huge delays, and so many visitors to the official website that it crashed for hours. Nonprofits across the state selected to distribute the money reported huge demand as people rushed to secure a spot for the first-come, first-served program. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or Chirla, one of 12 nonprofits tapped by the state to distribute the funds, received more than 1.1m phone calls on day one of the program – 630,000 calls just within the first 90 minutes of opening the hotline.

Just 1 of the 12 activist groups claims to have gotten 1,137,000 phone calls. That's a whole lot.

The Pew estimate was that there were over 2 million illegal aliens in California. We can safely say that number is nonsense.

In NYC, over a million IDNYC cards were handed out. Over 1 million illegal aliens received licenses in California.

How many actual illegal aliens are there? What's the actual population of California? How much of California's outsized political influence is the result of fake districts, a situation that will continue due to Justice Robert's to protect census fakery?",fake

Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020





On May 1, 2020, 45 congress members co-sponsored Bill HR 6666, proposing to spend $100 BILLION dollars in 2020 to hire ""contact tracers"", coronavirus testers, and reporting agents. If passed, this would create an unprecedented new mega-industry for what appears to be a type of ""medical martial law"".

Proponents of this bill apparently want to hire a massive number of staff to enforce ""social distancing"", administer tests in our homes -- apparently whether we consent or not -- and apparently even grant themselves the right to take people who ""test positive"" from their homes!

The full name of this bill HR 6666 -- yes, that's the actual bill number -- is the ""COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act"". As many of you know, what is referred to as ""contact tracing"" is more aptly called total Big Brother surveillance.

Ventura, California recently announced their own draconian measure threatening to forcibly test and remove people from their homes if ""necessary""... though they subsequently backtracked probably due to the massive pushback.

As many of us have come to realize (not a comfortable process), there is INDEED an agenda to lock humanity into a so-called ""new normal"" reality of technocratic policing and constant monitoring. Self-appointed technocrats and their organizations want to have us vaccinated and tracked with wireless and, it strongly appears, biometrics.

But millions are waking up and sharing information. This is a fight for the soul of humanity, and we're learning what it means to combine love and action.

YOU'VE AWAKENED. NOW LET'S COME TOGETHER AND ACT.

This instant action is the first step. It will be sent to each of YOUR elected reps, at the Federal, State and Municipal level.

We have about 80% coverage at the local level... i.e. so for most of you, you'll be able to instantly send to your Mayor and Councillors. Also, we currently have USA nationwide coverage, and will add several other countries shortly.



In this action, we'll use strong yet respectful language to 1) ask them to stop HR 6666 and all similar legislation, *AND* 2) remove our consent for all violations to our Constitutional Rights -- including those occuring during this crisis.

PRINCIPLES OF NON-CONSENT

Doing this simple action is powerful! In legal and contractual terms, there's a mechanism called ""implied consent"", or ""tacit acceptance."" That means that, once you've been notified of (or even learned about) a thing, if you haven't said NO, you've said YES.



Because this is a free-will universe, those that pull the strings in our society want us to be informed of their agenda... to be in fear about it... and to not go further than sharing information, signing petitions (which do not remove our consent), and perhaps demonstrating.

These types of actions are all well and good, but they do not go deep enough, because we can do all of these things and still be in a position of legally / contractually having consented to the situation -- or, in contractual terms, to their ""offer"".

But when we begin to realize who we are, the power we have, and the terrible charade happening in our world that is intended to bind us, we can turn the tables, then create what we want instead. Removing our consent and standing with our unalienable* rights, granted by our Creator (as recognized in the Constitution), is a significant and powerful first step.

* unalienable: that which cannot be seprated from you.



BELOW IS THE NOTICE TEMPLATE WE'LL HELP YOU INSTANTLY SEND.

NOTE: Since you are the one with power, you are the reponsible party. It's important that you read the Notice in full; and since it's editable, customize it accordingly (on Step 2) so that you are in full agreement with what you are sending.

Dear [Elected Rep's Name],

Below are critically important questions, evidence, facts, and my NOTICE OF TERMS to you in your public and private capacities.

Transmission of this notice has been electronically recorded. Thank you for reading this notice, sent to you in good faith, and without ill-intent. Please respond ASAP.

In this current crisis, measures have been undertaken which are harming me against my consent. Further malicious actions are being threatened against me, and against the rule of law itself.

A central example is the TRACE Act (HR 6666), proposing $100 BILLION in 2020 to create an industry of ""contact tracers"" - a ubiquitous, fascist surveillance network - to enforce testing and apparently to grant the ""authority"" to remove people from their dwellings. See: bit.ly/bill6666

This action is egregious and, for federal officials, I ask you to immediately stop this bill. For all officials: stop all anti-Constitution legislation, and pass laws preserve all Constitutional rights and the rule of law in this country.

PLAIN STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. I have unalienable rights recognized in the original U.S. Constitution that cannot be superseded by any agenda, nor be removed from me. I understand these laws of the land to be active and currently valid. If this is not the case, please send verification in writing within 72 hours.

B. My unalienable rights are being harmed by agendas implemented by oath-sworn elected officials, corporate executives and/or non-elected officials (collectively ""Agents Of Harm""). These include, without limitation:

i. My free rights to speak, travel, do commerce, work, assemble, and be free of surveillance without warrant.

ii. A threat of medical procedures or experimentation without my consent.

iii. Threats of punitive detention, violence and or assault for non-compliance.

C. My unalienable rights are NOT conditional - i.e. subject to proving I am not contagious, nor submitting to surveillance, nor anything that would cause me harm - properly called ""extortion"".

NOTICE OF TERMS

Effective immediately, and until each of the below questions are answered to my satisfaction, LET IT BE KNOWN throughout all jurisdictions and dimensions that:

A. I DO NOT CONSENT to being harmed by any imposition of quarantine, or restriction on my right to assemble, work, travel, speak or do commerce.

B. I DO NOT CONSENT to being told to live in fear, nor made to wear a mask, nor being mandated an allowable proximity to others.

C. I DO NOT CONSENT to any offer of forced medical experimentation or testing; nor forced medical procedure (i.e. vaccine, or substance delivered by air, water, or other means without my knowledge and consent); nor exposure to radiation from 4G/5G/wireless deployments; nor being tracked by any technology or biometric device on or adjacent to my body.

D. I HEREBY ACCEPT YOUR OATH OF OFFICE as your sworn statement that binds you to uphold my Constitutional rights, protect me from harm once noticed, and to liability when acting with negligence or without duty of care.

E. I RESERVE ALL OF MY RIGHTS, nunc pro tunc, to pursue remedy for ALL harm AND THREATS OF HARM, which may constitute CRIMINAL ASSAULT, and or tort, caused or contributed by Agents Of Harm. I intend to seek remedy and lawful justice unless and until the stated harmful actions cease and desist.

If you do not agree with my lawful ability to state and realize these claims and terms, please make your case in writing within 72 hours. If I receive no response from you, or if you offer any response that violates the supremacy of the original U.S. Constitution and you do not disprove my claim that the U.S. Constitution is active and valid, I will deem you to be in agreement and will proceed accordingly.

With no global organization or agency keeping track of cases from cruise ships, the Miami Herald, a Florida-based newspaper, decided to track outbreaks on oceangoing cruise ships.

As of April 23rd, the Miami Herald found at least 3,582 people during or directly after a cruise have tested positive for COVID-19, with “at least 65 people” dead as a result. The COVID-19 cases they found were linked to at least 54 oceangoing cruise ships — roughly one-fifth of the global ocean cruise fleet. However, that number could still grow, with the outlet pledging to continue tracking and providing weekly updates until the pandemic ends.

Some of the infected passengers were sent straight from the cruise ships to hospitals, but many returned to their homes — some of them traveling back home through commercial flights, potentially spreading the virus even further. Adding to the issue was the fact that many crew members were unable to leave their ships due to the virus; at one point, 15 cruise ships were rotating around PortMiami, leaving them as “sitting ducks for outbreaks,” Miami Herald reports.

Miami Herald reporters collected data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, foreign health departments, news reports, as well as interviews from passengers and crew aboard those ships. The outlet reached out to four of the world’s most significant cruise lines, though only Carnival and MSC Cruises provided data.

1479,1166,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-riddle-of-solitude-in-the-age-of-the-coronavirus,2020-05-16,The Riddle of Solitude in the Age of the Coronavirus,"For six weeks during the late winter of 1989, I had a cabin in the woods to call my own. It stood in a small clearing just off a muddy road: one room that contained almost all a writer needed then—a scratched table in front of a window, a rocking chair beside a fireplace, a bookcase, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a teakettle. I’d arrived at the MacDowell Colony, an artists’ residency in Peterborough, New Hampshire, which had been supporting writers, composers, painters, and sculptors since 1906. That winter, there were about fifteen of us in cabins scattered through the woods. We could visit each other—the kettle came with two cups—but not without an expressed invitation. Solitude had its rules. Most days, I kept to myself.

Each evening, I walked half a mile to our communal dinner, the quiet magnifying every sound: the door shutting behind me, my footfalls crunching on the frozen road. One of the things I loved was the sense of safety I felt in the darkening woods. I kept track of the moon. I scanned the sky for Venus and the first glimmerings of Orion. Often, my work still filled my head and, as I emerged from the pines into the open field and saw the bright lights of the dining room in the distance, I felt as if I had to break through a pane of glass to join in. Even so, I loved the intimacy of that meal with others. I’d quickly learned to identify one novelist’s laugh, and to expect a certain painter’s smell of woodsmoke. We gossiped and swapped stories, etching rumor into myth: the woman who had chained herself to her desk in a desperate attempt to stay, a man who fled the quiet—or maybe the trees? Looking back now, I marvel at how quickly a feeling of community took hold, abetted, I’m guessing, by our common purpose, our separateness from our usual lives, and the solitude of our days.

Residencies like MacDowell are often described as “retreats,” which implies a welcome escape from life, or a withdrawal. But those six weeks meant far more to me. I was in my early thirties, and just beginning my serious attempts at writing, working in snatched time in the hours before my day jobs in bookstores and commercial kitchens. The quiet and solitude of my time at MacDowell was an inquiry into a life I wanted to lead, and a challenge. What was I going to do with all that time and space? Since then, in many ways, I’ve sought to build my life around the possibilities I discovered in that cabin, to carve out a world for thought, spending most of each day working in a quiet I built for myself. I came to feel at home in my solitude, having made peace with the way it isn’t predictably stable—with how I’d sometimes slip into it easily, at other times pacing in it, stalked by a restlessness that took effort to shake. I could anticipate its changing textures: the welcome intensity of it after coming home from a day of obligations, its starkness after the departure of a friend.

I live in a modest-sized Maine town and, when our library closed, back in mid-March, I began to isolate myself in earnest. At first, daily life didn’t feel all that different to me. The outside world was just a little quieter, muffled as though it were a Sunday in deep winter. I settled into work as usual, and even welcomed the greater stillness, which seemed to enlarge the sense of spaciousness in my home. But as the pandemic unfolded, and the days became more and more freighted with the unknown, the solitude I’d worked so long to establish began to feel threatened by something I can’t quite name. I began to realize just how much my solitude had existed within a larger web that I could see and hear and feel. Now, as I go through the familiar motions of routine in an altered world, I find myself conscious of absences, especially of the sounds that filtered in behind me as I worked—morning traffic, neighbors walking their dogs, children chattering on their way to the school at the end of the street—which marked the patterns of other people’s days, and defined my life, too.

This new solitude feels lean and hard. As I move deeper into it, I worry that it will replace all the subtle textures of the solitude into which I’ve grown over the last thirty years. And, hard as it is, I’m not sure where its borders lie. What is prudent and what is foolish. What must be endured, what can’t be endured. When it might end. Back in late March, once the snow melted away, I put out two lawn chairs, six feet apart, thinking that I’d have a friend over now and again; they could bring their own tea in a thermos, I thought, or a beer. But after a few weeks, as the daffodils began to show a little color, that didn’t seem like such a good idea. So, I closed up the gap in the chairs, just to look out on something resembling the normal spring in my yard. Several days ago, dreaming of change, I spaced them apart again.

Before I went to MacDowell, my hopes about writing felt like a secret. I’d published a handful of poems in literary journals; if I’d stopped writing, few would have cared, and my parents would have been relieved. I was living outside of Boston with housemates, I was scrambling just to pay the rent. My dream of solitude was a simple one, naïve: I just wanted to be left alone to write. To have the time. In the quiet and space of that cabin in the woods, I got a glimpse of what a writing life would ask of me. As the days went on, I began feeling more ambitious for my work. I had time to try new ideas, to make mistakes and muddle things up. I spent untold hours nosing around, guessing, reading, trying to discern shape, making peace with waste and second thoughts. I’m not sure anymore how much I actually accomplished—it would take another four or five years for me to finish my first book—but I still remember the tenor of those hours, all my own. The spare space grew increasingly intimate and personal, even though I had brought so little with me: a bag of clothes, a box of books, a radio, my typewriter. I can still hear the tapping, and feel the pressure of my fingers on its keys. When I struggled with restlessness, I walked in the woods or turned on the radio and let unfamiliar voices in.

That world quickly came to feel like my real life, and on the last day of my residency, as I slowly packed up my things, returning the studio to its blank possibility, I was stunned by how quickly all sense of my presence dissipated. Driving home, spring advanced as I made my way south. Winter trees reddened; moss was bright on the stone walls. It was as though, in less than two hours, I had travelled through an entire season, and the world I returned to seemed cluttered with what I’d left behind. I certainly wasn’t much good in the kitchen on my first days back at work, and I knew the few hours I had to write were no longer going to be enough.",real
1487,1070,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/5/15/21259105/joffrey-ballet-dancers-exercises-at-home-tips-muscle-tone-strength-coronavirus,2020-05-15,A Joffrey workout: 3 dancers suggest exercises to tone muscles at home,"Even with the prospect of Illinois businesses reopening in phases in the coming months, and the warmer weather beckoning us to step outside for a walk or jog to keep fit and get some much-needed sunshine, there are still plenty of indoor workout options to consider in this stay-at-home age.

We turned to Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet company members Brooke Linford, Princess Reid and Graham Maverick to share some easy-to-do-at-home exercises to help tone and stretch. They’re easy enough to do while binge-watching your favorite Netflix series, and best of all, they’re ideal for everyone from workout novices to diehards.

“I now try to work out five days a week,” said Linford, a six-year member of the Joffrey. “Especially stretching. It’s so important.”

While the dancers technically work out six days a week during a regular Joffrey season with rehearsals, dance classes and general exercise, the pandemic has meant the cancellation of the company’s entire season — and that community experience. And while the company provides online classes via Zoom three times a week for its dancers, working out during a quarantine has become an individual effort.

“The [online] classes make us feel like we’re all together in a way, but working out on our own is a big part of [staying in shape],” Linford said. “I would encourage everyone to try some kind of stretching exercise a few days a week if possible, even for 15 minutes. Most important is to set goals for yourself and not get discouraged or frustrated. You don’t need a full, intense workout every day. Just do what you can to make your body feel healthy and happy.”

Favorite workout and why: I love working out in many different ways. Between yoga, ballet, biking or just going to the gym it’s hard to say what is my favorite. One of the exercises that I have been doing more now at the house has been calf raises. You stand with the ball of one foot on the bottom step and do about 20 to 30 releves (rises) on each side at a time. It helps strengthen both your calves and ankles, and you should get a nice burn quickly.

Some things to think about when doing your calf raises: Make sure that your body is completely parallel with your foot and when you do the raises make sure that you not only go all the way up but also down. One of the best things about this workout is that you don’t need much to do it, only a staircase or even a large [hardcover] book such as one of the later “Harry Potter” books.

Music inspiration: I enjoy a lot of music, new and old, but what I’ve been playing for my workout recently has been Black Sabbath’s first album. Really gets the blood going for me.

Brooke Linford

Number of years as Joffrey artist: 6

Favorite workout and why: My favorite exercise is clamshells because I feel like it is the “magic physical therapy exercise” to make my body happy and healthy. It targets the gluteus medius, and in doing so also provides stability in the ankles, knees and back. I feel like at any given time in ballet class or rehearsal there is always one person doing clamshells.

What should people make sure they do in order to do this exercise correctly: There are different angles at which you can have your knees and still have it work. But the most important thing is to not rotate your hips [forward] and keep your body in line. Sometimes I like to put my hand on my hip to make sure I’m not opening up to get a little more rotation with my knee.

Best household item to accompany your workout: For extra strengthening it’s helpful to add a resistance band or theraband tied above your knees. But if you don’t have that available, using your hand on your thigh and gently pushing when opening and closing adds good resistance as well.

Favorite workout song: It depends on my mood, but right now I’m feeling the disco essentials playlist on Apple Music. I definitely need something with a strong or funky beat to help motivate myself.

Princess Reid

Number of years as Joffrey artist: 2

Favorite workout and why: My favorite workout is actually a stretch called the “pigeon pose.” I like this stretch because it really gets into your hamstring and the front of your hip (hip flexor). It’s nice to do before a class or workout.

Favorite workout song: One of my favorite songs to workout to is “Fantazia” by Roy Blair. I like this one because the beat is great for cardio.

Prior to the Chinese Coronavirus making a mess of lives and economies, this term might have featured in a Saturday morning infomercial on the latest weight loss fad. Now it has become the holy grail of fighting this viral pandemic.

The New York Times, in a rare moment not bashing President Trump, explains flattening the curve. There are two curves, a steep one and a flat one, as we have seen endlessly on the news.

One had a steep peak indicating a surge of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time. The gentler curve results in fewer people infected at this critical moment in time — preventing a surge that would inundate the healthcare system and ultimately, one hopes, resulting in fewer deaths.

The basketball player wholeheartedly agrees. “What we need to do is flatten that down,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

But the area under the curve, the number of cases, and potentially deaths, is about the same. It is like ripping off a bandage quickly, which may hurt at the moment, versus peeling it off slowly and painlessly but taking longer to accomplish. As the NY Times notes, fewer deaths is what “one hopes” for but not necessarily what one expects.

If the medical system is overwhelmed, there may not be enough ventilators or ICU beds to meet demand. Fortunately, this never occurred, even in the epicenter of New York City. In fact, the curve was so flat that makeshift hospitals in Seattle, Denver, and New York, as well as two massive hospital ships, were largely unnecessary.

The models predicting shortages were wrong, despite certain state governors screaming, with backup vocals from the media, for ventilators and ICU beds that they never needed or used.

As the curve flattens, more and more individuals are exposed to the virus, bringing the population closer to herd immunity. At that point there are not enough viable hosts for the virus, and it burns itself out like a Chinese firework.

As new case numbers and fatalities are on the decline, it is time to think about reopening the shuttered economy before the socio-economic toll of the shutdown exceeds the toll from the virus.

Los Angeles plans on maintaining stay-at-home orders for three more months, essentially writing off summer. This despite their cases and deaths appearing to have peaked at the time of this writing. Oregon plans to stay shut down until July 6, almost two months from now. Interestingly the states and cities wanting to extend their shutdowns are primarily run by Democrats. Is that a coincidence?

Meanwhile, Georgia reopened two weeks ago, against the recommendations of Trump, the basketball player and scarf queen, and virtually every media outlet in the country. Has the disease surged as the smart set predicted? Actually it’s the opposite with the lowest number of COVID patients hospitalized and lowest ventilator use in over a month, as Governor Kemp tweeted.

Right on schedule, the basketball player is pouring water on the smoldering economy. In testimony this week to the Senate, CNN reports, “Fauci tells Congress that states face serious consequences if they reopen too quickly.” Fauci is skeptical about kids returning to school this fall. With kids at home all year, and parents unable to work if their kids are not in school, how can the economy rebound? Or is that the point?

It seems the political and medical deep state want the economy to stay closed for as long as possible. At least until November 4. Is their goal to flatten the curve or to flatten President Trump, and his bid for reelection in six months?

How convenient it is to keep the economy closed as long as possible, hopefully into fall, so Trump can run for reelection with 20 to 30 percent unemployment and double-digit GDP decline. So what if suicides, alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and depression increase by a commensurate amount. In the world of the DC elites, this is all acceptable collateral damage in the war against the Orange Man.

Forget the numbers and the wildly inaccurate models. The US reports 82,000 deaths currently. The scarf queen believes that the CDC has inflated Wuhan virus deaths “by as much as 25 percent.” Meaning the current number could be around 60,000 deaths, similar to a bad flu season.

Even that number may be exaggerated as COVID deaths are “presumed,” but not all respiratory disease is COVID. But the numbers are all the excuse the basketball player and state governors need to keep their economies staying at home, in bed with the lights off. Who benefits?

How does this hurt President Trump? Aside from having to run for reelection on economic numbers not seen since the Great Depression, it provides the perfect foil for Sleepy Joe Biden.

Trump rallies, famous for jazzing up his base, will be indefinitely on hold. Biden couldn’t fill a rally in school lunchroom, much less in an arena, and will be given a pass. He can babble incoherently during 5-minute interviews he gives to fawning media fanboys, hiding in his basement, reading from a script or repeating the words his wife or advisors tell him just off camera.

Democrat primaries were cancelled over virus concerns, handing the nomination to Biden, kicking Bernie Sanders and his supporters to the curb, just as they did four years ago.

The Chinese virus also provides an excuse for the Democrats to push mail-in ballots, providing ample opportunity to cheat. Even if they can’t win the White House, they might be able to flip a few Senate seats and neuter Trump’s second term.

Democrat mayors and governors have run their locales into a fiscal abyss. Perhaps they want to crush economies to death with an expectation of a federal bailout to rescue their insolvent union pension funds, sanctuary city promises to illegals, and trains to nowhere.

Will any of this work? Perhaps, as there is a full court press by Democrats and the media. Most Republicans are sitting on their hands doing nothing to support their president and party. How many Republican House members heard live testimony several years ago of #ObamaGate conspirators testifying under oath that they saw no evidence of Trump Russia collusion but said nothing, allowing the story to fester until this past week when this testimony was finally released?

Presidential opinion polls at this point are all but worthless. Remember the endless predictions of a Clinton landslide, persisting through election day? A better barometer is the Rasmussen Daily Presidential Tracking Poll showing Trump with 46 percent approval on May 12, compared to 44 percent approval for Obama exactly eight years ago. There was no virus or economic shutdown eight years ago, only a fawning media and a hapless Republican opponent for the fall, yet Trump’s current support is solid.

The curve has been flattened successfully, meaning next on the agenda is flattening President Trump and his reelection hopes. Is this about the virus or the election? Has it ever been really about the virus or simply the latest chapter of #ObamaGate. Stormy and Avenatti failed. Mueller failed. Schiff and impeachment failed. Right on schedule came the Chinese virus destroying the economy and possibly Trump too.

Is this a coincidence? Was the goal to flatten the curve or to flatten Trump’s reelection? Decide for yourself.

Col. Sam Sachs could not believe his eyes.

Stretching for almost two miles were more than 300 vehicles — decorated with balloons, American flags and hand-made signs, all wishing Sachs a happy 105th birthday. Drivers honked, passengers whooped and waved flags as they slowly rolled by on Conquista Avenue.

A musician leaned out of his car and played the official U.S. Army theme on his trumpet. Sachs, a veteran of World War II who participated in the Normandy invasion on D-Day June 6, 1944, responded with a salute.

A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s helicopter hovered overhead and police and fire sirens erupted in a crazy kind of unison.

Kate Smith’s rendition of “God Bless America,” blared over loudspeakers.

More than 200 flags were placed in the ground in the front yard.

The voice of Frank Sinatra crooned “Young at Heart.” After all, Sam said the lyric “…and if you should survive to 105, think of all you’ll derive out of being alive” inspired him to stay put on the planet for as long as he has.

More than 150 neighbors and well-wishers, most wearing masks because of the coronavirus crisis and striving to keep their distance, applauded and shouted out as cars passed by.

Sachs, who stood for 90 minutes while leaning on a railing, was clearly moved by the demonstration of love.

“Today has just been overwhelming,” he said. “This is the best birthday party I have ever had. How many times can I say thank you to all of you?”

Every variety of birthday card — more than 6,000 of them — were displayed on tables in the driveway. And that’s sort of where this ultimate birthday party was born.

Ivonne Meader, owner and administrator of the Mom and Dad’s House facility where Sam lives, realized that “Safer At Home” measures were sure to prevent a traditional gathering for his birthday.

Meader posted a video of Sachs telling his story on YouTube, and urging folks to send birthday cards. Surely a few dozen would arrive. The video went viral, was reported upon by every media outlet imaginable and even wooed local government to get involved, with Lakewood Mayor Todd Rogers and the City Council taking up the crusade.

The cards poured in from every state in the nation, we well as from England, Canada and South Korea.

One of the cards: A hand-signed note from President Donald Trump, who thanked Sachs for service to his country.

Michael R. Brown, the mayor of Grand Forks, North Dakota, where Sachs was born and raised, sent word that Sachs’s birthday was declared “Sam Sachs Day” in the city.

“Unbelievable,” Sachs kept saying from his porch as the parade — ranging from classic cars of the Sultans Car Club to hot rods to soccer-mom minivans, pickup trucks and first responder vehicles — rolled on for more than an hour.

Some observers opined that the parade must have been one of the longest, if not the longest, drive-by celebration, suddenly a Southern California tradition amid the pandemic.

Rick Smith, president of the Sultans — who was driving a white 1955 Chevrolet — said the club felt honored to celebrate Sachs’s life.

Doug Vaughn, an original member of the Sultans — driving a 1952 purple deluxe Chevrolet coupe — said he and many of the Sultans were veterans who were grateful for his service.

On June 6, 1944, Sachs was the lead officer in a glider with the grim nickname of “Flying Coffin” because it had no weapons to protect itself from enemy fire during the mammoth, historic D-Day invasion of Normandy. His glider was filled with machine guns, ammunition and eight soldiers whose job was to land behind enemy lines and destroy German defenses. He survived the bloody assault, which cost thousands of lives on both sides, but was pivotal in securing World War II victory for the Allies.

“We love you, Sam!” said one handmade sign held by a young boy who leaned out oft the window of an SUV.

A pickup truck went by painted entirely in the colors of the Los Angeles Rams football team and bearing the team logo.

Steve Leff, a retired Anaheim police officer now living in Riverside, gave Sachs a wooden plaque recognizing his time with the 82nd Airborne Division.

“This day has brought tears to my eyes,” said Sharon Strong, a next-door neighbor of Sachs.

“He is such a great person,” said another neighbor, Nancy Tran. “He is so sweet and walks by our house every day for exercise. He always says hello.”

Samuella McMahon, another neighbor, was there with her children, Aiden, 11, Saoirse, 10, and Caoimhe, 5, who had made signs wishing Sachs a happy birthday.

Later in the afternoon, the city of Lakewood had a more formal program.

Mayor Rogers called Sachs “a true American hero.”

Rogers read aloud that proclamation from his counterpart in Grand Forks, where Sachs was born on April 26,1915.

Naresh Solanki, mayor of Cerritos, where Sachs lived for more than 50 years before moving into the assisted care home operated by Mom & Dad’s House in Lakewood, congratulated Sachs.

Specialist Raivyn Hearne from the 40th Infantry Division Band of the California Army National Guard belted out the National Anthem.

And then Hearne led the throng in one of the most anticipated, and most heartfelt, renditions of “Happy Birthday to You” ever sung.

Sachs ended the celebration by observing how the coronavirus crisis had brought “another level of reality to the world” but also “produced an unimaginable level of kindness to me and others.”

Did the day measure up? Sachs called it “the most magical time in my life.”

And he’ll be back for his 106th, he vowed.

“I hope I see all of you here again next year,” Sachs said with a smile. “I’m going to work on it.”",real
1500,1856,http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2020/05/23/625977/protest-Spain-Madrid-coronavirus-lockdown-,2020-05-23,Far-right protests erupt in Spain against coronavirus lockdowns,"Thousands of cars and motorbikes honking horns and waving Spanish flags drove in procession through Madrid on Saturday, May 23, as part of a nationwide protest called by the far-right Vox party against the country's coronavirus lockdown.

Spain, which imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns on March 14, has started to ease restrictions, but Madrid and Barcelona have remained in lockdown for longer because of more severe coronavirus outbreaks.

The protesters called for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, of the centre-left Socialists and left-wing Podemos coalition, to resign over their handling of the coronavirus crisis, and, in particular, the lockdowns and the damage done to the economy and jobs.

Protests against the lockdown started in Madrid's wealthy Salamanca neighbourhood last week, where people started banging pots and pans. But Saturday's procession marked the first organised protest against the government since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

Vox urged people to protest in every regional capital, and similar car processions took place in Seville and Barcelona, among others.

Madrid and Barcelona are preparing to ease their lockdowns from Monday as infections have slowed. This will allow outdoor dining and gatherings of up to 10 people.

Spain has registered 28,628 deaths from COVID-19 and 234,824 cases.

BEIJING — The unemployment rate in China remained near historic highs in April, highlighting the challenges the world's second-largest economy still faces in recovering fully from the economic shock of the coronavirus. China's official, but highly doubted, urban unemployment rate rose to 6.0% in April, from 5.9% in March, according to figures released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics. ""The pressure on employment is rather large,"" bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters at least three times during Friday's press conference. That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.

Although monthly figures for the overall economy show some recovery, challenges remain, such as resuming work and the impact of the virus overseas, Liu said. ""Right now, the trajectory of economic development still requires observation, but ... based on the results of policies for resuming work and production, we have the confidence, ability and basis for extending the momentum of recovery and improvement."" Liu noted that the bureau's survey found that at the end of April, the number of migrant workers who had returned to their jobs in the cities was about 90% of what it was a year ago. In early March, official figures showed the return to work for migrant workers from the poorest households in the country was about half of what it was a year ago. More than half of China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by at least a week in an effort to control the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By early March, the virus outbreak had stalled domestically while accelerating its spread overseas. Covid-19 has now killed more than 302,000 people worldwide, including over 4,600 in China.

Slowing economy to hit more jobs

Similar lockdowns on economic activity in the U.S. sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7% in April, the highest since World War II and up from months of historic lows near 4% or less. In February, the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the unemployment rate jumped to a record high of 6.2%. For the 25 to 59-year-old group, the rate has hovered near 5.5% for the last three months. The average work-hours a week per employee also fell in April by 30 minutes to 44.3 hours, the data showed. China's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country changed its methodology from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to capture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near 4% to 5% for the last 20 years. ""We think that pressure on employment will continue,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said Friday. He pointed to factors such as fewer new jobs due to slower economic growth, sluggish demand for Chinese exports and a record-high number of university graduates this year. The continued struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the majority of jobs and growth in China, adds further pressure to employment. Pang pointed to third-party business registration data that showed 460,000 companies closed in the first quarter, while the establishment of 3.2 million new Chinese companies during that time still marked a nearly 29% decrease from a year ago.

Rebekah Jones said in an email to the USA TODAY Network that she single-handedly created two applications in two languages, four dashboards, six unique maps with layers of data functionality for 32 variables covering a half a million lines of data. Her objective was to create a way for Floridians and researchers to see what the COVID-19 situation was in real time.

Then, she was dismissed.

""I worked on it alone, sixteen hours a day for two months, most of which I was never paid for, and now that this has happened I'll probably never get paid for,"" she wrote in an email, confirming that she had not just been reassigned on May 5, but fired from her job as Geographic Information Systems manager for the Florida Department of Health.

After USA TODAY Network first reported Jones' removal from her position in charge of the Florida COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard she created, she confirmed, as reported by CBS-12 in West Palm Beach that she was fired because she was ordered to censor some data, but refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

She provided no further details.

In an email last Friday to researchers and other data users, Jones warned that with her removal changes were likely coming to the accessibility and transparency of the dashboard data.

""They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data,"" she wrote.

Researchers who saw the email reacted with shock and dismay, suggesting it could be evidence that the Gov. Ron De Santis' government was censoring information to support the case for re-opening Florida.

Lucky Tran, a Biologist and public health communicator at Columbia University, on Twitter reacted to the news in a series of tweets: ""When politicians censor scientists and manipulate the numbers, the rest of us suffer,"" he wrote.

US Congresswoman representing Tampa Bay, Kathy Castor wrote: ""Floridians will not feel safe in opening up without transparency.""

Governor Ron DeSantis' spokeswoman, Helen Aguirre Ferré, issued a statement to the Miami Herald, saying: “The Florida COVID-19 Dashboard was created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) team in the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health. Although Rebekah Jones is no longer involved, the GIS team continues to manage and update the Dashboard providing accurate and important information that is publicly accessible.”

But emails from Jones through April showed that Jones was the one responding to feedback from researchers in a bid to improve and update her product. Jones told the USA TODAY Network that she alone was responsible for ""every line of code.""

In a May 5 email in which she announced the launch of a Spanish-language version of the dashboard, Jones wrote: ""Please be patient as we get all this connected and running smoothly, and do let me know if you see any errors."" It was sent the same day she was removed from her role managing of the dashboard.

For 60-days Jones said she never took a day off, not even when a powerful April 12 Easter tornado leveled her parents' home in Southeast Mississippi. A GoFundMe page was set up to help her family recover. Luckily, her mother survived. Her father, a truck driver, was in Texas at the time.

""Sorry if I’ve been a little slow to respond these last few days,"" she wrote to data users in an email just 3 days later reporting updates to how data was organized, and the inclusion of county-level race data.

Jones provided detailed updates in emails every few days, often technical and always responsive to user feedback. At the time was dismissed, she was working on making historical data more accessible to users.

On April 25, Jones provided an explanation to why the data set would go from morning and evening daily updates to just once per day.

""We’re gearing up to provide more analytics and data, and would not be able to process the full dataset twice daily with the staff we have,"" she wrote.

""We have been directed to start tracking data related to reopening, and it is consuming a lot of staff hours on very short notice.""

Days later she would be removed from the position entirely and her data users sounded the alarm that government might be censoring science.

Jones had worked with the Department of Health as a geospatial analyst and then a Geographic Information System (GIS) manager since obtaining her doctorate in Geography from Florida State University in 2018.

She holds a masters of science degree in geography and mass communication from Louisiana State University and a bachelors in Journalism and Geography from Syracuse University.

The Department of Health has so far not replied to request for comment.

“All of these restrictions, they sound more like communism,” said Florin Cimpean, senior pastor at Philadelphia Romanian Church of God in the Ravenswood neighborhood, one of several dozen religious leaders who gathered Thursday outside the Thompson Center to take issue with Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order.

But Cimpean, who said he grew up in Soviet-controlled Romania, added: “Not even communists were able to completely shut down churches. We are essential. The spiritual, emotional and mental impact of this [coronavirus] will probably be greater long-term than the medical one.”

Cimpean said his church held services last week with about 40 people in attendance and plans to do so again this weekend — a violation of Pritzker’s order, which allows for a maximum religious gathering of 10 people, regardless of place of worship’s size.

The gathering Thursday came on the heels of a victory a day earlier for Pritzker, whose order survived a religious challenge in federal court from a pair of churches that sought to hold worship services with strict social-distancing guidelines in place.

The pastors gathered at the Thompson Center say the 10-person limit is arbitrary and doesn’t take into account the size of churches — some of which have large sanctuaries and could, they say, safely handle more parishioners.

Pastor Charles Mironas of Hope Community Bible Church in Park Ridge echoed the sentiments of his fellow religious leaders when he described the church as “essential.”

“If ever the world needed a church, it’s now,” Mironas said. “We are a balm of healing to the community. People need to know there is hope, need to know that there are answers.”

The pastors say they weren’t given a voice — weren’t invited to the table — before Pritzker issued his order.

Wilson, who organized the event, said the order doesn’t recognize that many in poorer communities might not have the option to shift services online, as has become common in more affluent North Side communities.

“You have a lot of homes in the poor communities that don’t even have Wi-Fi,” Wilson said. “They don’t have the technology. They can’t afford it.”

Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said she has no interest in having noncomplying parishioners or pastors arrested, but has also said she’ll do what needs to be done to make sure the rules are followed.

Asked if he’s concerned that violating the stay-at-home order might lead to an arrest, Cimpean said: “I don’t think the mayor will do that. But if they want to do that, let them come. It is what it is.”",real

But the Blackhawks safely can mark down a 12th consecutive NHL attendance title.

When the 2019-20 season was paused March 11, the Hawks were averaging 21,441 fans for 34 home games at the United Center, topping the Canadiens’ average of 21,085 for the highest mark in hockey.

Taking outdoor games out of the equation, the Hawks have led the league in attendance every season since 2008-09. That’s the same season their ongoing 531-game sellout streak began.

Blackhawks’ Attendance History Season Attendance Rank Season Attendance Rank 2019-20 21,441 1st 2018-19 21,339 1st 2017-18 21,653 1st 2016-17 21,751 1st 2015-16 21,859 1st 2014-15 21,769 1st 2013-14 21,616 1st 2012-13 21,775 1st 2011-12 21,553 1st 2010-11 21,423 1st 2009-10 21,356 1st 2008-09 21,783 1st

And while there is increasing optimism leaguewide that the 2019-20 regular season eventually will restart, there’s little chance that resumption will take place in Chicago and even lower odds that fans will be able to attend the rescheduled games.

After all, the logistics of hosting a crowd of 20,000-plus in the coronavirus era — not to mention the various governmental bans across the United States and Canada, including in Illinois, on large public gatherings — would be impossible.

Even looking ahead to 2020-21, it’s very possible that part or all of the season could be played without fans.

The NHL reportedly is looking at another strange calendar for the coming season. If the 2020 Stanley Cup isn’t awarded until September, as the latest resumption plan suggests, the 2020-21 season might not start until December and might not end until July. And the league has no control over COVID-19 test and vaccine availability, both of which will have a huge effect on when spectators safely can return to large sporting arenas.

So the Hawks can chalk up the 2019-20 attendance title as theirs without much hesitation. But the fact that it might be a while before they get a chance to defend that title somewhat overrides the positivity.

Plus, longtime president John McDonough — widely credited as the mastermind behind the Hawks’ marketing and ticket-sales dynasty that coincided with the team’s on-ice dynasty — is gone after nearly 13 years in the position.

Although much mystery about the reasons for McDonough’s firing remains, the plummeting resale value of Hawks tickets and the starting-to-decline number of season-ticket holders — two trends that threaten to break the sellout streak — might have been factors.

In other words, 2019-20 might prove to be the last season of league-leading attendance on Madison Street.

2019-20 Attendance Review

• The Hawks’ average crowd of 21,441 represented a small increase from the average of 21,339 last season, ending a streak of four annual declines.

• The largest crowd (21,878) came when the Hawks hosted the Predators on Feb. 21.

• The smallest crowd (21,172) came when the Hawks hosted the Golden Knights on Oct. 22.

• A crowd of 21,275 attended the Hawks’ game against the Sharks on March 11, the day before the season was halted.

• The average weekday crowd was 21,444, four more than the average weekend crowd of 21,440.

• Games against Central Division rivals were slightly more popular, drawing an average of 21,519 fans, compared with 21,405 for non-division games.

• The Hawks had 19 home games start at 7:30 p.m. and averaged 21,435 fans at those games. They had 15 games start at other times (although only one before 6 p.m.) and averaged 21,448 fans at those.",real

His donations have ranged across a number of causes from stopping domestic violence, to giving equal access to the internet for students.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced last month that he was donating $1 billion of his Square equity to COVID-19 relief, and so far he's dispersed over $87 million.

Dorsey created a new charity fund called Start Small LLC, which will initially focus on relief efforts to help with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Dorsey estimated that the fund is around 28% of his total wealth.

The Twitter CEO released a spreadsheet, which so far only shows $73 million in donations, accounting for how much and to where donations are being made. According to the spreadsheet, Dorsey has made contributions to organizations tackling domestic violence due to the pandemic, HIV/AIDS, refugees, advocacy for prisoners, among many others.

However, in a tweet, Dorsey added that there are several initiatives that have not been added to the spreadsheet yet.

Dorsey has so far donated over $1.3 million to two organizations that will screen for HIV as well as address how the current pandemic is impacting HIV in marginalized communities.

""Funds will support the Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF) COVID-19 Emergency Fund to support EJAF frontline partners to respond to the pandemic and its' effects on HIV prevention and care for the most marginalized communities,"" Dorsey's spreadsheet wrote.

Experts have worried efforts to limit the spread of and treat infectious diseases like HIV could be significantly reduced due to the pandemic.

Tolbert Nyenswah, a research associate at Johns Hopkins University, previously told Business Insider that in countries where patients rely on clinics for medication, a lack of personal protective equipment means entire facilities that many rely on could be shut down if one hospital worker gets sicks.

That leaves people dealing with infectious diseases at risk. ""This will have longtime consequences for decades to come,"" Nyenswah said

Domestic violence has also increased as more people were sheltering in place. Business Insider previously reported that calls to hotlines in major cities increased during the lockdown. Dorsey is funding multiple initiatives to address the concern totaling more than $2.2 million.

He's also invested in organizations that provide necessary food for people in need, providing support for the homeless, mental health initiatives, as well as $10 million into the Oakland School Fund to close the educational gap between students who don't access to the internet and those who do.

According to The San Francisco Chronicle, officials in Oakland launched the initiative on Thursday to raise $12.5 million for 25,000 laptops and internet hotspots to families in the city. In a tweet Dorsey' wrote that he saw the initiative and funded it ""immediately.""

""$10mm to give EVERY single child in Oakland access to a laptop and internet in their homes, closing the digital divide,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The Chronicle added that 50,000 students in the cities public school system ""are disconnected or under-connected from technology at home.""

Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn’t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren’t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.

It can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. “Ma!” I’ll say. “Don’t risk your life for coconut shrimp!” Or, when that doesn’t work, “Ma! You’re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.”

Opinion

My father is sometimes watching television when I phone — CNN, thank God, not Fox — and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president’s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl’s nightmare.

“Don’t watch TV news, Mom,” I’ll say. “I never do.”

That’s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories — the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What’s the point? As for the president’s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... “Fortunate the person,” Soren Kierkegaard writes, “who did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.”

People who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I’m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. “What? You’re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that’s awful! When did he start doing that?”

And yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president’s lies. Maybe it’s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements — a much shorter list.

To the matter at hand.

On Monday, he — no need to speak the name — tweeted this:

“In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”

“The Invisible Enemy.” He means the virus, right? Though you can’t be certain, can you?

Three of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren’t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.

The old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” His “Look! A squirrel!” fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something — and, man, is this a botch — he winds up, lets loose “build the wall” and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.

The good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty’s crotch. By Friday, it’ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.

I’m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine’s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.

But I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading — to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang’s 101-story Vista Tower opens. Cold comfort, but comfort nonetheless.",real

The total cases include staff at district-run or charter schools or who work for outside vendors.

The district didn’t identify the two workers who passed away or say which jobs they held at which schools. Officials only said neither had recently been to a school building.

“With widespread community transmission in Chicago, the district’s number one priority has been keeping staff safe and healthy and our thoughts are with all members of the CPS community who have been impacted by this virus,” CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton said in a statement.

All schools in Illinois have been closed since March 17 through an order by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. But hundreds of CPS schools have operated as food and laptop distribution centers during that time, with lunchroom workers passing out more than 10 million meals and administrators handing out 102,000 digital devices.

Of the 85 known cases, 38 are “essential employees” who were at a school at least once in recent weeks. The food and computer distribution programs at those schools were paused once the district was notified of the positive tests.

For the 38 cases that caused the temporary closures, signs were hung up on the front entrance of the buildings — but CPS didn’t send email notifications to parents, teachers or students at those schools. Officials also haven’t released a list of the schools.

The district at the end of March stopped notifying communities if someone at their school tested positive for the coronavirus. CPS officials pointed to the fact that, at that point, schools had been closed for two weeks — equal to the 14-day incubation period for the virus — and any new positive tests at that point would not have been contracted by in anyone in the building when schools were open.

The true impact on CPS’ 38,700 workers is undoubtedly much larger than currently known as Chicago reached 26,606 cases Tuesday with 1,068 deaths. As is generally the case, experts strongly suspect many more cases have gone unidentified in people who have recovered at home without being tested.",real

With social distancing guidelines possibly curtailing in-person voting at the polls in November, states are drawing up plans to rely more heavily on a mail-in system that has until now seen only limited use.

Get the latest news about the coronavirus and its ripple effects in Chicago and Illinois in our live blog.

Historically, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting. But social media users are already pushing grandiose theories casting doubt on the method. President Donald Trump has encouraged the skepticism, saying during a televised briefing that “a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting.” On Saturday, he tweeted: “Don’t allow RIGGED ELECTIONS!”

Justice Department officials are concerned foreign adversaries could exploit any vulnerabilities in the vote-by-mail process, especially since even minor tampering could trigger widespread doubts about the integrity of the vote.

“Is it possible, in particular for a foreign actor, to cause enough mischief in the vote-by-mail process to raise a question in the minds of Americans, particularly Americans perhaps whose candidate has lost, that somehow the result of this election is unfair?” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the department’s top national security official, said in describing a key question confronting law enforcement.

Several disinformation experts said they have not found evidence yet that foreign actors are covertly pushing a false narrative about mail-in voting.

But a sham social media campaign that feeds existing doubts about the U.S. election process would align with the Kremlin’s playbook, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington think tank. During the 2016 election, Russia-linked groups polluted American voters’ social media feeds with messages about hot-button topics like race relations, gun laws and immigration.

“You don’t have to hack the vote to hack people’s perception of the vulnerability of the vote,” he said. “All you need to do is to seed enough doubt about the legitimacy of a vote.”

Well before the coronavirus upended America’s electoral process, federal officials were girding for the prospect of foreign interference in the U.S. election. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned in February that Russia could seek to misuse voter registration data and even secretly advise campaigns or candidates, according to documents The Associated Press obtained.

Now, a potential overhaul of how millions of Americans vote could present new vulnerabilities for foreign adversaries to weaponize.

Only five states currently conduct mail-in voting, where a ballot is automatically mailed to every eligible voter.

The remaining states have substantial work in the months ahead. They will have to make major changes to their voting and tabulating systems, buy equipment or software to track the ballots and sort out who — individual voters or taxpayers — will pay for return postage in less than six months’ time to accommodate more voting by mail.

Some states are exploring how to simply expand existing absentee voting systems, in which voters can request a ballot.

“Just like you wouldn’t want to premiere your play straight to Broadway, it’s hard to have a very new or very changed system in a high-stakes presidential election, especially under conditions where normal meetings, trainings, might be impacted by the pandemic,” said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine.

Those last-minute changes could spur unsubstantiated claims about rampant voter fraud, an unsupported theory that Trump and some of his supporters have already pushed for years.

Russian state media have already questioned states’ attempts to postpone primaries or transition them to a mail-in process as governors grapple with how to hold an election against the backdrop of the virus.

“Coronavirus is coming, hide the ballots! Calls to cancel campaigns & voting erode already-thin trust in US primaries,” read a headline on the website of the Russian television channel RT, which broadcasts in English and is aimed at audiences outside Russia.

Meanwhile, conspiracy theories that Democrats are hyping the pandemic to push for mail-in voting or that forecasts of a second wave this fall are part of a ploy to cancel an in-person vote have received thousands of likes, retweets and shares on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit. The theories are popular in dozens of Facebook groups that have been created in recent weeks to protest governors’ stay-at-home orders.

“When you have this ambiguity and uncertainty, that’s fertile ground for pushing out false information,” said Schafer, the think tank fellow. “This is creating a perfect environment for these narratives to thrive.”

Negative chatter around mail-in ballots spiked in those Facebook groups after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed expanding early voting and mail-in voting last month, said Madelyn Webb, a research reporter for First Draft, an organization that tracks disinformation.

One popular meme accused Democrats of extending the quarantine to push “mail in ballots so they can cheat.” The image received a combined 90,000 likes, comments and shares, mostly on pro-Trump and conservative Facebook pages.

And for under $100, the Alaska Republican Party took out a Facebook ad that said: “Democrats are using the coronavirus pandemic to gut election fraud protections. Don’t let them. Add your name to our petition to STOP BALLOT HARVESTING!” Facebook said the ad, which is still running, does not violate its policies.

Meanwhile, liberal social media users are pushing mail-in voting as a surefire option, glossing over some of the challenges such drastic changes to the voting system will present.

Facebook groups like Occupy Democrats and Being Liberal widely circulated an article promoting vote by mail, saying it has a history of success because the U.S. military has used the method for decades.",real

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez poked fun at Bill Gates' plans to push his fellow billionaires to donate more towards fighting coronavirus, arguing they could just pay their taxes in a tweet on Wednesday evening.

""If only there were some public fund billionaires could pay into along with everyone else that helps fund our infrastructure, hospitals, and public systems all at once,"" the progressive lawmaker said. She was commenting on a Recode report that the Microsoft cofounder and philanthropist could pool billionaires' donations or launch a philanthropic platform for them.

""It could even be a modest % of what they earn every year. We could have an agency collect it and everything,"" Ocasio-Cortez, who goes by ""AOC,"" continued.

""If it helps, they could think of it as a subscription service to living in an advanced society,"" the congresswoman said in a second tweet.

""Just imagine billionaires paying enough so teachers in the US don't have to work multiple jobs and sell their own blood plasma to survive,"" she added. ""Call me radical, but it might be worth it.""

In follow-up tweets, Ocasio-Cortez mocked several commenters — including the editor of a conservative magazine and the head of policy at a budget-responsibility group — who apparently didn't get the joke that income taxes and the Internal Revenue Service already exist.

Gates, in his ongoing battle against the coronavirus, could solicit donations from signers of the Giving Pledge, Recode reported.

He launched the declaration with famed investor and close friend Warren Buffett almost a decade ago. More than 200 billionaires have signed it, signaling their commitment to eventually donate at least half their net worth to charitable causes.

The philanthropist is also mulling a ""marketplace"" to connect billionaires with each other and selected non-profits to boost donations, Recode said.",real

The English league had given a tentative return date of April 30 but that was pushed back with a statement saying the “2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so” and only with the full support of government and medical guidance.

“There is a combined objective for all remaining domestic league and cup matches to be played,” the league said, “enabling us to maintain the integrity of each competition.”

Teams still have nine or 10 games left to play, with Liverpool — the leader by 25 points — still needing two more wins to clinch its first title since 1990.

UEFA, in a letter signed by the European Clubs’ Association and the European Leagues, has urged members not to abandon their competitions. Halting leagues without approval from UEFA could see teams blocked from qualifying for the Champions League and Europa League as they are determined based on final positions in domestic standings.

In a statement released after the 20 teams met by video conference, the league said it voted to advance funds of 125 million pounds ($150 million) to clubs in the English Football League and fifth-tier National League, many of which are struggling to cope with the financial consequences of the suspension of matches.

It also committed 20 million pounds ($24 million) to Britain’s National Health Service.

At the end of a week when Premier League players came under growing public pressure to forego some of their salaries to help pay club staff, the league said clubs had agreed to consult players over a wage deduction or deferral of 30% “in the face of substantial and continuing losses.”

“The league will be in regular contact with the Professional Footballers’ Association,” read the statement, “and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow between the league, players and club representatives.”",real

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain lifted on Tuesday a ban on direct flights and ships from Italy imposed since March 11 to curb the coronavirus, but tourism restrictions and a 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers remained in place.

A much-reduced death rate from COVID-19 has encouraged Spain to begin easing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, but the tourism-dependent economy is likely to have to wait until late June to welcome holidaymakers back.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is preparing to ask parliament to extend until late June a state of emergency which has helped limit infections but also brought unprecedented restrictions on borders and movement, causing huge economic damage.

Cadena Ser radio reported that cabinet would use a meeting on Tuesday to discuss an extension until June 27. A government spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.

At the peak of the outbreak, Spain was losing hundreds of citizens a day as stretched hospitals and care homes struggled to treat patients.

But the overnight death toll reported on Monday was 59, the lowest in two months, bringing the known total to 27,709.

'What in God's name is he doing?': Biden rips Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine

Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat or prevent the new coronavirus.

""It's like saying maybe if you injected Clorox into your blood, you know it may cure you. Come on, man. What is he doing? What in God's name is he doing?"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said during a virtual Yahoo News town hall. ""The things the president say, the words of a president, matter.""

Biden worried that people may hear Trump's comments and start using the drug themselves. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against improper use of the drug for COVID-19 outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, citing evidence that the drug could have potentially fatal side effects.

""Look, this is absolutely irresponsible. There's no serious medical personnel out there saying to use that drug. It's counterproductive. It's not going to help,"" Biden said.

After scientist fired, Florida gov. calls coronavirus data manipulation charge a 'nonissue'

Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”

The accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push, which he has called a “safe” and “step by step” approach despite its COVID-19 death toll topping 2,000 Tuesday.

Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months. She wrote that she ""would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency.""

But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.

Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""

DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination.""

CDC quietly releases longer, detailed reopening guidance: reports

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly published a longer 60-page document providing guidance to businesses, restaurants, schools and other establishments on how to reopen while minimizing the risk of spreading the virus, CNN and Politico reported.

The document comes after the agency had released six one-page documents and faced criticism amid reports that the Trump administration shelved the longer, more detailed reopening guidance for being too specific.

Politico and CNN reported Trump administration officials delayed the release of the document because of references to religious organizations that they feared were being unfairly targeted. References to faith-based groups were removed from the final 60-page document, an unnamed CDC official told CNN.

Michigan conservative group to hold 'Operation Haircut' on Capitol lawn

The Michigan Conservative Coalition, an organization intended to shape policy and help more conservatives win election, will hold what it's calling Operation Haircut outside the Capitol on Wednesday. They will protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order and the closing of barbershops and hair salons.

“Michigan’s small business owners are patriotic and law-abiding citizens but enough is enough,” said Marian Sheridan, a co-founder of the group, who added that marijuana dispensaries remain open but ""barber shops are, somehow, unsafe.""

Michigan State Police did not immediately disclose how they would react to the event. Organizers said those attending ""will be encouraged to comply with social distancing and other safe practices,"" such as wearing masks, but people providing haircuts would not be able to remain six feet away from people getting them, as required by the order.

Donald Trump calls high number of US coronavirus cases a ‘badge of honor'

President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States – the highest in the world – a “badge of honor,” arguing the still-increasing number of cases is simply evidence the country is testing more people.

“By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?""

The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.

McDonald's workers in 20 cities set to strike over lack of COVID-19 protections

Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting, as part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Labor organizers say scores of McDonald's workers in at least 16 states have COVID-19. A survey of more than 800 workers, organizers say, found 42% reported being told not to wear protective gear by management and 46% said they came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.

The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.

The company disputes the allegations.

Travelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait another 30 days as the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures to curb COVID-19 infections.

Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.

Mnuchin: 'No workers should give their lives' to boost GDP, stock market

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said no worker should die in order to boost the U.S. economy. Mnuchin was responding to a question in an exchange with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, during a hearing on the coronavirus relief legislation.

""How many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow by 1,000 points?"" Brown asked.

""No workers should give their lives to do that, Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,"" Mnuchin replied.

Mnuchin also faced sharp questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., about whether companies would have to keep employees on their payrolls if they received aid from a joint Fed-Treasury program. “You’re boosting your Wall Street buddies,"" Warren told the secretary when he declined to comment.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified Tuesday that the Fed and Congress ""may need to do more"" to help revive the economy.

Coronavirus lockdowns have caused a whopping drop in carbon emissions

The coronavirus lockdowns have had an “extreme” effect on daily carbon emissions, causing a whopping 17% drop globally during peak confinement measures by early April – levels last seen in 2006.

However, it is unlikely to last, according to a new analysis by an international team of scientists published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.

This is the first analysis to measure the pandemic-driven global drop in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from January to April of this year.

While the impact of lockdown measures is likely to lead to the largest annual decrease in emissions since the end of World War II, 2020 is still on track to be one of the five hottest years on record, and the study notes that these reductions are no “silver lining.”

Late last night, Facebook began banning all links from Brighteon.com, regardless of the content of the videos, claiming that videos about gardening and smoothie recipes and backyard chickens now violate Facebook’s “community guidelines.”

The real reason for the banning, of course, is that Brighteon.com hosts the “Plandemic” video featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits who warns about the dangers of the coronavirus vaccine. Users have posted a Portuguese version of the documentary that has achieved nearly a million views, and a Greek language version is also rapidly gaining hundreds of thousands of views.

The rapid explosion in people viewing the video has resulted in Facebook blacklisting the entire Brighteon platform, confirming Facebook is engaged in anti-trust behavior to try to crush competing platforms by starving them of user traffic. This is blatant criminal anti-trust behavior on the part of Facebook, and it is a direct attack on human knowledge and human freedom.

Even more importantly, both Facebook and YouTube now openly claim that any content which contradicts the “official” opinions of the W.H.O. will be banned, meaning Facebook and YouTube are now run by communist China, because that’s the anti-human rights regime that dictates the policies of the W.H.O.

Facebook scrubs all Natural News content posted since November of 2019

Adding to the extreme, punitive censorship, Facebook also banned all links from NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com while scrubbing all the content we have posted, back to November of 2019, which is the month in which the Wuhan coronavirus bioweapon was released by communist China.

Any attempt to post any link from Natural News or NewsTarget is now blocked by Facebook, and Facebook has scrubbed all our posts about the coronavirus in order to cover up communist China’s war against humanity.

In effect, Facebook is now covering up the bioweapons crimes of communist China by banning independent media publishers that are documenting China’s deliberate engineering and release of this weapon against humanity.

This puts Mark Zuckerberg in the same class as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, actively carrying out crimes against humanity and defending an anti-human regime that builds weapons of mass destruction to cause mass death on a global scale. Mark Zuckerberg is an enemy of humanity and a criminal against all who value life and liberty.

We repeat our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and other tech giant CEOs that have engaged in malicious, anti-human censorship that protects communist China and the vaccine industry.

How to share the Plandemic video on Facebook and other platforms without getting banned

Because of the extreme level of criminal censorship being carried out by Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and even Vimeo, the only current way to share Plandemic videos from Brighteon.com or other targeted platforms is to embed the videos on another website page, then share that page.

Each video on Brighteon.com has a “share” link at the bottom right-hand corner:

From the share link, you can copy either the direct link to the video play page or get embed code that embeds the video into any web page. This code can be pasted into the HTML code of any page, including pages that are edited in WordPress or other page editors.

Here’s an example of the embed code for the Plandemic video from the “Jesus Social” channel on Brighteon:

<iframe src=’https://www.brighteon.com/embed/45c1558c-4163-4961-9f92-11c7c4c1af21′ width=’560′ height=’315′ frameborder=’0′ allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here’s the embedded video it produces when you add this code to your web page:

Once the video is embedded in your page, you can then share that page on Facebook or other platforms.

You can also, of course, share Brighteon links on Gab.com and other alternative internet ecosystems that aren’t run by evil globalists working for communist China.

In the future, we will also have alternate URLs and domain names that will allow you to share Brighteon videos, but those domains will of course be eventually banned by Facebook and the other tech giants, all of which are criminal operations that are complicit in communist China’s war against humanity.

The tech giants will not stop until they succeed in destroying humanity and achieving mass death across the globe

We have now arrived at a very dark chapter in human history where the gatekeepers who control online speech are protecting the very communist regime that has declared war on humanity through the deliberate deployment of engineered bioweapons. Mark Zuckerberg and other big tech globalists are criminals against humanity, and they no longer even pretend to support free speech. Instead, they brazenly censor all platforms and publishers that are working to blow the whistle on global criminals who wield weapons of mass destruction against the innocent.

This is why today, we are repeating our call for the arrest and prosecution of Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Google, YouTube, Twitter and Vimeo for their conspiracy against humankind and their deliberate, malicious crimes against human freedom and human survival.

Human freedom cannot coexist with these evil, anti-human regimes. We either dismantle the tech giants and imprison their architects and leaders, or humanity dies in darkness.

Even if it is his last act, President Trump must deploy military police to arrest the CEOs of the tech giants and prosecute them under military tribunals for their crimes against humanity. Trump must order the US State Department to seize the domain names of all the tech giants engaged in malicious censorship, halting their operations until they restore First Amendment protections on their platforms. In just 24 hours, Trump could order the US government to seize Google.com, Apple.com, Twitter.com, YouTube.com, Vimeo.com and all the other domains run by the techno-fascists, and he could force them to either respect the First Amendment or be permanently put out of business.

And no, that isn’t tyranny on the part of government, not when the only demand is that tech platforms must respect the freedoms described in the Bill of Rights. For the free world to thrive, Sec. 230 must be dismantled and free speech must be affirmed across the internet, or humanity has no future other than death and tyranny.

That’s the whole plan behind the coronavirus, of course: To unleash mass death, tyranny and censorship, carrying out a new holocaust against billions of innocent people so that globalists can achieve their depopulation dreams.

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Shares of Target stock were down more than 2% as of 10:45 a.m. Wednesday.

“This year, and there is no way around it, we will witness a historic economic downturn,” DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association’s latest survey of industrial companies.

The DIHK’s expectation for an economic plunge in the double-digit percentage range compares with the government’s forecast for a record contraction of 6.3% in 2020.

“German businesses are facing their biggest challenge since the end of World War Two,” Schweitzer said, adding that many industrial companies were facing massive liquidity problems.

The DIHK survey, conducted among some 10,000 industrial companies between May 4-6, showed three-quarters reported declining demand and 80% expected a substantial drop in sales.

Nearly 50% of German industrial companies are putting investments on hold and are planning to cut their budgets because of the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

Due to the disruptions caused by the outbreak in many countries across the globe, almost a fifth of German industrial companies are currently reorganising their supply chains, the survey showed.

“World market shares are currently being redistributed,” Schweitzer said.

DIHK trade expert Volker Treier said he expected German exports to decline by 15% this year, due to weaker demand from major export markets such as the United States.

For 2021, DIHK is expecting the economy to grow by roughly 5%, Schweitzer said.",real

I shouldn’t admit this, because age discrimination for older women searching for work, as I now am, is real. This makes me, at 54, one of the oldest of the Gen Xers. Like many in my generation, I have spent the past 32 years hopping over the Frogger logs of an unforgiving gig economy. The sociologist Allison Pugh has dubbed this the “tumbleweed society,” in which “job insecurity is rampant and widely seen as inevitable.” If COVID-19 can be said to have any upsides, it is that its devastating economic ravages have finally unmasked the truth of late-stage American capitalism: It is a system in which every worker is as expendable as every shareholder is sacrosanct.

At 3 p.m., having regained my composure, I clicked on the Zoom link. A Doom link, I thought, as my image appeared vertically between the CEO’s and our head of HR’s. In Brady Bunch terms, I’d be Alice, my boss would be Carol, and our head of HR would be Mike.

Read: Notes from a videochat memorial

“I’m so sorry,” my boss said. Her eyes watered anew. She had made this same call several times over the course of that day: seven times out of a staff of 44, so a 16 percent reduction in headcount. Many of us let go that day were among the higher earners, meaning our loss would allow more runway for the company than if they’d dismissed those earning less. In the end, with venture-capital belts tightening and deals falling through left and right because of the virus, the company’s survival was all about runway. I understood this, even if it pained me to accept it.

“I’m so sorry, too,” I said, choking back my own tears. “But this is an unprecedented time, and I get it. Are you okay? I’m worried about you.”

Hyper-empathy, my last shrink once labeled this propensity of mine to avoid my own pain by over-identifying with the pain of others: a trait that is simultaneously both self-protective and self-destructive. Were we not in a pandemic, I might have fought harder. Been angrier. Demanded more severance. Then again, were the economy not evaporating, I would not have been laid off. I had to keep reminding myself of this fact. Plus I was being offered the chance to keep working on a contract basis, with reduced hours, so I am in better shape than most. “When this pandemic is over, do you imagine me coming back as a full-time employee?” I asked.

Absolutely, my boss said. Her pained expression was hurting me. In fact, being fired over Zoom, without the normal visual cues and eye contact of in-person communication, only magnified the surreality of the moment. I found the whole experience of managing the disembodied pain of others emotionally draining. “Zoom fatigue,” it’s been dubbed, this simulacrum of human interaction in which we’re all now living. Had the three of us been sitting in a room in person while I was getting fired, instead of floating along as lifeless pixels on a screen, the pain I knew each of us was feeling in that moment—yes, even our head of HR, who spoke touching words about my work and value—might have seemed equally shared. Instead it felt as if I was taking it all on myself.",real

Some states, like Texas, have already seen a surge in new cases.

But it's still too early to draw definitive conclusions about the effects of loosened restrictions, since data on confirmed cases and deaths lags behind the on-the-ground reality.

These interactive charts show how many new COVID-19 cases are being reported daily in 20 states.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Across the US, 30 states have relaxed aspects of their stay-at-home orders and allowed certain businesses to reopen, hoping the worst is behind them. Meanwhile, 18 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam remain under lockdown.

Public-health experts have repeatedly warned that lifting lockdowns too early could lead to more waves of coronavirus transmission, which could force states to implement new lockdowns to curb the virus' spread.

Some states have already seen cases spike. Less than two weeks after its stay-at-home order expired, Texas reported its largest daily increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths. Others states, including Florida and Georgia, eased restrictions in recent weeks even though case numbers weren't declining, but have seen them hold relatively stable so far. States like New York and Washington, where outbreaks hit earlier and lockdowns are still in effect, have reported steady declines in new cases.

However, we don't yet have definitive answers as to how states' decisions to loosen restrictions are impacting their outbreaks. That's because new case data can lag several weeks behind what's actually happening — people who get COVID-19 take an average of five days to develop symptoms, then may need to wait multiple days for test results. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has estimated that numbers we see today reflect infections that occurred about two weeks ago.

In states that aren't doing extensive testing, many cases might also not show on public health officials' radars at all.

Still, based on our best current information, here's what the progression of new cases reported each day looks like in 20 US states that have had significant COVID-19 outbreaks.",real

But despite the staggering job losses, the stock market has climbed well off its recent lows.

While this may seem confusing, here's the deal: Investors think April was the low point for the economy and things could start to improve — or at least not get worse — from here.

April was the worst month for job losses in the history of the US.

More Americans lost their jobs last month than during the entire financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 — or during any downturn in the past 80 years.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

Our official unemployment rate is now 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression. Moreover, as Insider's Carmen Reinicke explains, this rate counts only people who are actively looking for work and not finding it, so it most likely is a significant undercount, as it excludes the Americans who want to be working but aren't even looking.

Andy Kiersz / Business Insider

The ""employment to population"" ratio also dropped to a record low. Only about half of Americans — 51% — are employed right now. The peak of this measure was about 64% in 2000.

7.7 million restaurant, bar, and hotel workers lost their jobs.

2.5 million health-services and education workers lost their jobs.

2.1 million retail and store workers lost their jobs.

And so on.

The only bright spot is that about 18 million of the 20.5 million job losses are considered temporary. At least for now, these folks think they'll be rehired when the economy improves.

This devastating jobs report raises a reasonable question that has come up often in the past few weeks:

Why, in the face of this economic and social calamity, is the stock market going up?

Back in February and early March, as the pandemic ravaged one industry after another, the stock market plunged by a third in five weeks.

Since then, the news has seemed to have only gotten worse.

And yet, since bottoming in mid-March, the stock market has risen steadily. Now, six weeks later, it has recovered about two-thirds of its losses and is not far below its all-time high.

So what gives?

Well, first, stock prices generally reflect investors' assessments about the future, not the past. As horrific as the economic news has been over the past six weeks, it has actually been better than some investors expected it might be back in mid-March.

Some economists, moreover, believe that we've already experienced the worst of the impact of the pandemic and that the economy will improve from here.

Second, the government's fast, aggressive financial response to the crisis — in the form of emergency aid packages from the Treasury and Congress and emergency liquidity from the Federal Reserve — has significantly limited the potential economic damage.

The government aid packages haven't saved all jobs (by a long shot), and they won't save all US businesses, but they've helped save a lot.

In fact, one of Wall Street's best economists, Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, estimates that the various forms of government aid — including enhanced unemployment benefits — will actually more than offset the income Americans have collectively lost this year. This aid will not be shared equally, so there will still be plenty of individual pain, but, in aggregate, a lot of the economy's consumer spending should be maintained.

Goldman Sachs

Last of all, the market has done well because many of the most valuable companies in the index have been shielded or actually even benefitted from the crisis.

The Charles Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes that more than half of the value of the S&P 500 comes from companies in the tech, healthcare, and communications-services industries. These companies have done fine or even well in the past few months.

The so-called FANG+ companies, moreover — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, and other internet giants — make up a bigger percentage of the market than ever before. And they have collectively risen.

So, in short, for now, the reason the stock market is rising is that some investors believe we've seen the worst of the impact and that the situation will improve from here.

Other investors, meanwhile, think there's more bad news to come and those hoping for a quick recovery will be disappointed. The most famous investor on the planet, Warren Buffett, appears to be in this camp.

Which investors are right?

We'll see. No one has a crystal ball, and the endless challenge of trying to make better predictions than other investors is one reason the stock market is so fascinating.

In the meantime, our sympathies to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs in this crisis. We all hope that the optimists are right, that the worst is over, and that we can rebuild our economy quickly from here.

1577,99,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-money-unemployment.html,2020-03-18,Your Money: A Hub for Help During the Coronavirus Crisis,"
If your income has fallen or been cut off completely, we’re here to help. This guide will connect you to the basic information you’ll need to get through this, including on government benefits, free services and financial strategies. This guide has been updated with the details of the $2 trillion relief plan that has been enacted by Washington.
If you have a question that we have not answered about various forms of relief — or something you can offer that large numbers of people can access — please write to hubforhelp@nytimes.com. Ron and Tara will read every message.
Stimulus ChecksThe giant economic stimulus package will enable the federal government to begin making the payments, though the amount you receive will depend on your income.
Single adults who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full $1,200, while married couples with no children and earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, you get another $500.
People who earn more will see their payments decrease until they phase out completely. That happens for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. There are other situations that make certain people ineligible — college-age children who were claimed as dependents on their parents’ returns won’t receive a check, for example. And you generally need a valid Social Security number to collect as well.
Many people don’t have to do anything to receive the payment. If the Internal Revenue Service already has your bank account information from your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, it will transfer the money to you via direct deposit based on the recent income-tax figures it already has.
Payments started landing in mid-April, but it could take a few months more for some people to get them, despite the government’s removal of some hurdles. You can find out more about checking on the whereabouts of your payment here.
Unemployment InsuranceThe new relief package made significant, albeit temporary, changes to the way the unemployment insurance system works and increases benefit amounts until July 31.
Under the plan, these state programs now cover far more people than are usually eligible, including self-employed people and part-time workers.
The plan also makes exceptions for people who cannot work for a variety of coronavirus-related reasons — and you don’t necessarily need to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — if you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment insurance.
States set many of their own rules, including for benefit amounts, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces roughly 45 percent of your lost income.
Most states pay benefits for 26 weeks, though some states have trimmed that back. (This primer provides more information about how the program usually works when the country isn’t struggling to contain a pandemic; eligibility rules have changed since this was last posted.)
The new law temporarily increases the amount of benefits by $600 weekly. It also extends by up to 13 weeks the time period for which state-level benefits are available for many workers. Here’s a helpful illustration that breaks down how the program works in New York state.
Paid Sick Leave and Family LeaveThe coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the outbreak, but there are lots of exceptions.
Most workers at small and midsize companies, as well as government employees, can get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a day.
Some workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.
Part-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed — including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.
There are gaps, though. Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses, and companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.
And these changes aren’t permanent — the leave law expires Dec. 31.You can find out more from the Department of Labor, which has posted a fact sheet for workers and a Q&A.
Federal Student LoansIf you have a federal student loan, you should automatically receive some relief without lifting a finger: Borrowers will be placed in so-called administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making payments from March 13 until Sept. 30.
No interest will accrue during the administrative forbearance period. (Usually interest continues to pile up when borrowers pause their payments because of a hardship.) Interest you accrued before the period began will also not be rolled into your loan principal,  according to a Department of Education spokeswoman.
Borrowers who want to continue making loan payments can do so — and you may end up paying the balance down faster if the full amount of your payment can be applied to your loan’s principal.
The Education Department says loan payments that are skipped under the administrative forbearance will still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in income-driven repayment and public service loan forgiveness programs, as long as the other usual requirements are fulfilled. Your loan servicer will have more details.
But keep in mind that for now, this relief applies only to federal student loans owned by the Education Department, such as direct loans (including those in default). Loans issued through state agencies and others, including big private lenders like Sallie Mae, are not covered. Other loans not covered include the majority of Federal Family Education Loans, which are mostly held by commercial lenders, and school-held Perkins loans.
Some private lenders are offering relief programs. Sallie Mae said it was offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit. Another, Navient, made an identical offer for “qualified” borrowers; a spokesman said you just need to contact the company and explain how your financial situation had changed. A third big private lender, Wells Fargo, says it will offer help, but a spokesman said the bank would not commit to a set number of months or any other specifics.
If you have more questions, check out the Education Department’s Q&A here. It addresses what to do if you have auto-debit payments (they’re suspended during this period), are trying to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, and more.
To see if your loans are eligible for this temporary pause, try contacting your loan servicer — the company where you send monthly payments — online or by phone. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact it, go to StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; T.T.Y. for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for more help.
Mortgages and RentMillions of homeowners have already pressed the pause button on their mortgage payments, now that their financial lives have been upended by the pandemic.
Under the CARES Act, homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government are permitted to temporarily suspend their payments, a move called a forbearance, for up to a year. This covers about 70 percent of mortgage holders and includes loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (known as F.H.A. loans), and those guaranteed by the Department of Veterans and the Department of Agriculture.
After the forbearance period is over, however, the skipped payments must be paid back. And how that is done will vary depending on your personal circumstances — and who owns your loan. About 30 percent of mortgage holders have loans owned by banks or private borrowers, and their options aren’t always clear.
If you have a federally backed loan, you should be presented with several different ways to become current on your mortgage — and none of them require you to immediately pay the money back in a lump sum (but you can if you want to). If you can afford to resume your regular payments, you might pay the money back over several months, for example, or settle up when the home is sold, refinanced or when the mortgage term is up.
People who cannot afford to make their mortgage payments after the forbearance period expires will probably have to modify their loan (to lower the monthly amount), a more formal process that will require an application.
To find out which entity may control your mortgage, you can search your address on various government websites. And if you don’t feel like you are being treated fairly — or are simply overwhelmed by the process — it might help to find a housing counselor. For more information, check out our short resource guide here.
Federal housing officials have also announced a nationwide eviction and foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with loans backed by Fannie, Freddie and the F.H.A. This includes foreclosures that are already in progress.
A coalition of mortgage industry groups representing banks, finance companies and others has said it will also grant payment suspensions of at least three months — and up to 12 months — to homeowners whose loans are not owned by Fannie or Freddie, but they have said their effort requires a federal backstop.
If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. Just Shelter’s founders are Matthew Desmond, the author of the book “Evicted,” and Tessa Lowinske Desmond. Mr. Desmond is also the founder of Eviction Lab; it is publishing a list of local and regional actions to pause evictions of renters.
The emergency stimulus bill put a temporary, nationwide eviction moratorium in place for any renters whose landlords have mortgages backed or owned by Fannie, Freddie or the F.H.A. This will last through the end of July, and landlords can’t charge any fees or penalties for nonpayment of rent either. The moratorium applies only to eviction for nonpayment; tenants can still be evicted for other reasons.
Regulators have also told landlords whose own mortgages are owned by Fannie or Freddie that they too can use forbearance, just as long as they do not evict tenants after they pause their mortgage payments. The challenge for renters is figuring out whether their landlord has such a mortgage. This information sometimes appears if you look up the address in the National Housing Preservation Database.
If the landlord’s mortgage is not in forbearance, renters who skip payments could be risking eviction if there has not been a local prohibition. (New York, for example, has suspended eviction actions until further notice.)
Utility BillsSome utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment.A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small business customers who can’t pay their bills: AT&T, Comcast, Cox, RCN, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. A full list of companies is available on the Federal Communications Commission site.
It is not yet clear whether companies want customers to call to invoke this relief and provide proof or whether they will offer it automatically to everyone. People who need help should call and ask.
A number of water service providers have either suspended shut-offs for nonpayment or don’t shut service off for late payments generally, according to a ProPublica roundup. They include Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Long Beach, Calif.; Los Angeles; Newark; New York City and St. Louis.
In Washington state, the main Seattle area utilities are suspending cutoffs as well. In addition, the provider of electric and water service in Seattle is allowing people to self-certify their recent income reductions in order to qualify for at least half off their bills.
In California, Pacific Gas and Electric has, until further notice, stopped shutting off its services to consumers and businesses who have not paid.
In New York, Con Edison also has temporarily suspended any electric and gas service shut-offs.If utilities in other areas follow suit, they are likely to publish alerts somewhere on the top of their websites or in the news release section of their pages.
More Helpful AdviceYou have three extra months to file your federal income taxes. The federal government has moved the tax filing deadline to July 15. You don’t have to file your return or make payments until then. If you are owed a refund, you’ll still receive it as normal when you file your tax return, no matter when you submit it.

Loeffler gives documents to Justice Department,"Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., her husband Jeffrey Sprecher participate in Loefflers swear-in reenactment for the cameras in the Capitol on Monday, Jan. 6, 2020.

Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, refused to say Friday whether it has given federal law enforcement agencies information related to stock sales by CEO and Chairman Jeff Sprecher and his wife, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler.

Intercontinental Exchange formally declined to comment after a flurry of news about a probe into stock sales in trading accounts related to four senators.

That news included Loeffler revealing that she has given documents and information to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee about the sales from accounts she had with Sprecher.

Those sales came in the weeks before financial markets plunged as the Covid-19 pandemic spread in the United States.

Intercontinental Exchange has not said in regulatory filings that either the company or Sprecher are the subject of criminal or civil probes or have turned over information to investigators about the CEO's trades.

The FBI and Department of Justice appears to be eyeing trades by Loeffler and Sprecher, as well as by Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and by the husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.

Accounts connected to those senators cumulatively sold millions of dollars worth of stock in the weeks before financial markets crashed in late February as Covid-19 cases in the United States began spiking.

Starting on Jan. 24, Loeffler and Sprecher sold stocks over the next three weeks that were valued at between $1.3 million and $3.1 million, according to disclosure reports filed by the senator.

All four senators say they did nothing wrong, and that the trades were not connected to non-public information they received.

That includes private briefings for lawmakers in January and early February by top federal health officials who warned senators about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak before the United States began seeing large numbers of officially reported cases.

Sprecher and Loeffler's sales began on the same day that Loeffler attended a senators-only briefing on the coronavirus.",real

It's the creative concept that an Ocean City, Maryland, restaurant unveiled over the weekend to keep patrons at least 6 feet apart once the governor gave the OK for restaurants and bars to reopen.

Shaped like oversized inner tubes, the tables were custom made for Fish Tales, where employees rolled them out of a large box truck for their Facebook live debut over the weekend, reports the Salisbury Daily Times, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.

One week after reopening:Ocean City packed on sunny Saturday

""It's like a bumper boat, but it's actually a table,"" owner Shawn Harmon said of the design, which was developed by Revolution Event Design and Production in Baltimore.

A customer will stand in the center of the circular table surrounded by a rubber barrier that keeps them safely separated from other patrons in accordance with social distancing guidelines. The tables sit on wheels that allow them to stay mobile.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had restaurants and bars across Maryland shuttered – with the exception of carryout and delivery service – since mid-March in an effort to curb the virus's spread.

Now that the state has eased into stage one of its gradual Roadmap to Recovery, eateries are itching to one day soon hopefully resume dine-in service.

Fish Tales is providing curbside and carryout service seven days a week and has also put significant distance between its outdoor tables in anticipation of being able to wait on patrons again.

""We've taken this very seriously from the beginning, and we just want to let everyone know what we've done in the interim to make sure that everybody stays safe and Ocean City can stay open,"" Harmon said in a social media video about the measures the establishment has taken.

This has been a common theme throughout the US as well as the World.

Reflect On: Is the new coronavirus being made out to be more dangerous than it actually is? Are the death numbers even accurate? Why has there been so much controversy and so much evidence of foul play?

The idea that deaths being attributed to the new coronavirus are greatly inflated has been a common theme all around the world for the past month or so, and it’s gaining even more traction. There are many reasons why this belief has been circulating, and one of them is the fact that health professionals, as well as those within politics, have been emphasizing this point.

For example, not long ago Dr. Ngozi Ezike, Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health stated that, even if it’s clear one died of an alternative cause, their death will still be marked as a COVID death. She explained that this is how coronavirus deaths were being calculated and was quite clear about it.

Vittorio Sgarbi, an Italian politician and Mayor of Sutri gave an emotional speech at a hearing on the 24th of April. He emphasized that the number of deaths in Italy due to COVID-19 are completely false and that the people are being lied to so that the government could impose more authoritarian measures on the citizenry. According to a study out of Italy, 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities that were examined specifically for this study were people who suffered from previous medical conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease. The study provides insight as to why their death rate may be much higher compared to other countries.

The point is, there are a number of examples as to why coronavirus deaths around the world might be very inflated. What’s listed above isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. You can read more about this topic and other examples I’ve written about, here.

The Colorado Example

The latest example of this comes from state Rep. Mark Baisley, who asked asked 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler to investigate whether the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) broke the law by classifying several deaths at a Centennial senior living facility as coronavirus deaths when they really weren’t the result of the coronavirus, as first reported by 9News. In a separate report by CBS4, Montezuma County Coroner George Deavers said CDPHE classified an alcohol-poisoning death in his county as a coronavirus death. Both men accused CDPHE of changing death certificates to add COVID-19.

“Falsely inflating the number of deaths due to COVID-19 adversely impacts the professional reputation of nursing homes, hospitals and healthcare workers while creating undue fear for families.” – Baisley

The number of deaths attributed to the coronavirus in Colorado recently passed 1,000, but after these accusations were made by Baisely, the CDPHE has stated that the number does not actually represent the number of people that have died due to the new coronavirus.

Are they simply trying to cover their tracks? Were they instructed to classify deaths as a result of the new coronavirus just because someone who dies of another cause simply dies with the coronavirus? Are they simply correcting and clarifying confusing data? Why is there so much confusion? Why are death numbers including people who didn’t actually die as a result of COVID-19? Why are changes being made to the Colorado numbers only when these facts are being brought to light, and are the revised numbers even accurate?

According to Dr. Eric France, CDPHE’s chief medical officer, the state’s surveillance-system reporting is in line with federal guidance and matches how other states are also reporting deaths. He also said that changes to clarify its public death-reporting have changed. The CDPHE has announced that going forward, cases in which people had COVID-19 and died of another cause will be recorded separately from the deaths that were caused by COVID-19.

But how many deaths have been attributed to this disease have already been used for the “official” statistics?

The issue even drew a pointed response from Gov. Jared Polis at his own news conference on Friday. “What the people of Colorado want to know is not who died with COVID-19, but who died of COVID-19,” said Polis.

Another interesting thing to note is that multiple studies have found that the infection rate of the new coronavirus is significantly higher than what’s been recorded, meaning that the infection fatality rate, according to these studies, is in the same ball park as seasonal influenza. With death numbers also coming into question, fewer deaths from the coronavirus would drive infection fatality rate even lower.

Furthermore, controversy has surrounded the testing kits, many have been found to be contaminated with the virus and other bacteria, and the Tanzanian president expressed that fruit they tested with the kits came back as positive, hinting to foul play and corruption.

The Takeaway

Never in history have we seen so much controversy surrounding a major global event since 9/11. Edward Snowden also recently expressed that many measures were put into place after 9/11 that still remain until this day, sharing his belief that governments are using the coronavirus to push even more authoritarian measures upon the citizenry. You have to ask yourself, why are some of the world’s leading scientists/epidemiologists in the field, as well as many doctors, getting censored for simply sharing their research and opinions. Why are their YouTube videos taken down, and why have people like Bill Gates become the official health authority regarding the coronavirus, what’s going on and the actions humanity should implement? This alone should raise a red flag for people.

I’ve said it many times, and I’ll say it again, there is a digital authoritarian Orwellian “fact-checker” going around the internet and censoring so much information. This effort is combined with a digital campaign of hate and absolute ridicule of anything that provides an opposing view/narrative in order to sway minds and control human consciousness.",fake

The safety of elected officials during the pandemic is front and center now that a valet to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary — whose husband is one of Trump’s closest advisers — have tested positive for the coronavirus.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker is working from his Gold Coast mansion after a member of his senior staff tested positive for COVID-19.

The infected staffer worked “down the hall” from the governor and attended daily meetings with Pritzker at the Thompson Center while following safety protocols, including wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and undergoing daily temperature checks, the governor said.

Across the street at City Hall, Lightfoot has taken similar precautions with employees in the mayor’s office.

“We have not had any cases amongst the senior staff. But like every other organization, we’ve had someone in the kind of larger mayor’s office … of over a hundred people,” the mayor said.

“The person was diagnosed, went into quarantine and isolation. We notified all of the people the person had come in contact with. This has been some weeks back. So we have a very specific protocol on how to handle these cases. We are doing temperature checks. And we are looking at other safety measures.”

Lightfoot said most of her staff has been working from home for weeks along with many other employees who normally work out of City Hall.

“We do have a small group that remains in the building. We’re being diligent about who comes in and who doesn’t. Most people are wearing masks. We’ve got hand-sanitizing products all over the office,” the mayor said.

“But we’re also looking at some additional measures, particularly as we start to think about the possibility of bringing staff back to City Hall. Those are ongoing conversations that we’re having.”

The mayor did not say how often she has been tested for the coronavirus or when she was tested last.

Lightfoot is frequently seen wearing a face mask that looks like the Chicago flag, with the words, “Stay Home. Save Lives.” Like the governor, she takes it off while speaking publicly.

On Tuesday, she congratulated 88 new firefighter EMTs by offering elbow bumps.",real
1594,862,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-coronavirus-waves-economy/,2020-05-13,"Former CDC chief Tom Frieden warns of ""many waves"" of COVID-19 if economy reopens too soon","CBS MoneyWatch spoke with Dr. Tom Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009-2017, about the challenge of reopening the American economy even as COVID-19 deaths continue to climb and before any effective treatments are available to combat the disease. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?

Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.

The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.

We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.

How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?

I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.

We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it — also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.

Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?

I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned — it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.

We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease — the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.

You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?

[We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day — that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.

Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""

What are the risks — to public health in the U.S. and to the economy — of reopening too quickly?

We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.

We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.

There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.

Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?

If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.

This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.

How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine — those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process — how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.",real
1598,287,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/10/21216845/coronavirus-covid19-abbott-rapid-swab-test-nose-nasal-how-it-feels-jayant-pinto-molly-erickson,2020-04-10,COVID-19 tests: What it feels like to have one,"Government and health officials are talking a lot about coronavirus testing. So what does it feel like to undergo one of the not-yet-widely-available nasal swab tests for COVID-19?

With testing still limited, we can’t offer a firsthand report. But Dr. Jayant Pinto can.

“It’s not comfortable, I’ll just be honest,” says Pinto, a University of Chicago Medicine otolaryngologist who’s had similar tests done on himself. “There’s a little discomfort. It’s not long-lasting. It’ll sting for a minute.”

It isn’t pain like you feel from a shot. Instead, think about how it felt if you’ve gotten chlorinated water up your nose in a swimming pool.

The complex nerve endings in your nose told your brain: That’s not right, there’s something bad in there. And that burning sensation makes you want to blow the water right back out.

Well, the swab test for COVID-19 is more intense than that.

“It’s a deep burning, and it often elicits tears and sometimes coughing,” says Molly K. Erickson, a nurse practitioner at Rush University Medical Center who helped set up the Chicago hospital’s testing sites. “That discomfort really comes with getting an adequate sample.”

So, if you didn’t feel anything, it means the test probably wasn’t done right.

There are several types of coronavirus tests. All involve collecting a sample using a swab.

That’s followed by molecular analysis to look for the presence of the virus’ genetic material.

Blood tests, in contrast, look for a person’s antibodies to a virus, which show past exposure and possibly future immunity. So far, one blood test for coronavirus has been approved by the U.S. government. Others are under development.

Most swab tests aim for the virus’ preferred hiding spots in the nasopharynx, located about seven centimeters straight back into the nose, or in the turbinate area, about 2.5 centimeters inside the nose.

The person administering the test will wear PPE — personal protective equipment — including a mask, face shield and gown, to protect against possible exposure from your breath or a sudden sneeze or any airborne particles that get stirred up.

Once the swab is inserted, it needs to be swirled around for about 15 seconds. Depending on the test, the same thing might also be done through your other nostril.

The discomfort you feel typically goes away quickly, and there’s usually no bleeding.

President Donald Trump, who’s been tested at least twice, described it as “not something I want to do every day, I can tell you that.”

U.S. testing got a boost late last month when Abbott Laboratories, based in Lake County, was given expedited approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration to roll out its new rapid COVID-19 test. It uses a portable machine about the size of a toaster to provide results quickly — as quickly as five minutes for a positive result and 13 minutes for a negative result.

The White House was one of the first locations to get the Abbott tests. Since the beginning of April, guests visiting Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been required to get a test even if they feel healthy, the Washington Post reported.

Most other people will have to wait a bit longer. Chicago-area facilities using the new Abbott test or other types of COVID-19 tests are offering them only to patients who go through a screening process and are found to have symptoms or to medical personnel and first-responders.

Erickson says Rush is using a combination of the Abbott kits, its own in-house tests and tests sent to private labs. The testing process is “very orchestrated” and not set up for walk-in visits by the public. Everyone must first be screened via a video visit or by a clinic, emergency room or hospital personnel and deemed a good candidate for testing.

Dr. Warren Wollin, senior director of Physicians Immediate Care, which has five drive-up centers in Chicago and elsewhere in northern Illinois, says the tests are limited to screened, symptomatic patients and first-responders.

“We try to keep it as low-risk as possible by keeping it outside the clinic,” Wollin says of the drive-up sites.

With the rapid test, patients get results while they wait in their cars, and medical professionals can act immediately if someone needs urgent care, Wollin says. Those who test positive but aren’t feeling ill might be directed to have a telehealth visit online.

What isn’t known yet: exactly how accurate the various COVID-19 tests are. Normally, reems of data have to be submitted to the FDA before a test is approved. But the usually stringent requirements were waived to more quickly bring testing to the public.",real

Economists agree that the US is already in a recession. Now, they're weighing what shape a potential recovery might take.

Many reports this week hit fresh records. But some showed glimmers of hope that a recovery may be coming as some states begin to reopen.

Here are seven economic signals that flashed warnings this week.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In just two short months, the US economy has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping shut downs to contain the spread of the disease.

Last week's April jobs report showed that the US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs and the unemployment rate spiked to 14.7%, the highest since the depths of the Great Depression. Since the eye-watering report, more have been released showing further damage to the US economy.

Economists and industry watchers agree that the US has been thrown into a recession from the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns. Now, all eyes are watching US economic data to gauge the extent of the damage and weigh what shape a recovery might take.

Initially, some argued that a swift, V-shaped recovery was possible. But as coronavirus-induced layoffs persist, and many consumers are still stuck at home, it now appears that any rebound will be more muted.

There have also been a few glimmers of hope as many states across the country slowly reopen. For example, even though April's jobs report showed devastating losses, 18.1 million workers were classified as temporarily unemployed, suggesting that they may be able to quickly re-enter the workforce when lockdowns are lifted.

In addition, some reports this week — while dismal — may represent a low point before a rebound. For example, April retail sales posted a second record slump, but may not record a third.

""This report was always going to be terrible,"" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a Friday note. ""But it likely marks the floor, given the gradual reopening now underway or soon to be underway.""

Andrew Cuomo plans to ""reimagine"" New York's public schools when they reopen in the fall, and Bill Gates is going to help him do it.

New York's public school system, the largest in the country, has been closed since March 16 and will remain closed through the rest of the school year as the city battles the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the country. Though Cuomo did not provide many details on his plans for the school system or the collaboration with the Gates Foundation, the governor did allude that major changes to New York's classrooms may be on the way.

""The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom, and teaches that class, and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms — why with all the technology you have?"" Cuomo said during his daily press briefing on the pandemic Tuesday.

The Gates Foundation told Business Insider in a statement the organization had ""committed to work with New York State on its efforts to ensure equitable access to education for its students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" and will soon provide more details about the partnership.

The collaboration with Cuomo won't be the first time the Gates Foundation has experimented with education. The billionaire-led organization spent $1 billion and seven years working on an initiative to improve test performance for students in low-income schools by closely monitoring teacher effectiveness. A report by independent think-tank RAND reviewing all the Gateses' education efforts in the US found in 2018 that the program ultimately didn't improve test scores or drop-out rates in the long-term, Business Insider reported at the time. In some cases, the program even ""did more harm than good,"" Jay Greene, a professor of education at the University of Arkansas, wrote on Education Next.

Cuomo also outlined other forthcoming changes to the state, including closing the city's previously 24/7 subway system nightly for cleanings and initiatives to make its healthcare system more resilient.",real

Find all our Lessons of the Day here.Lesson OverviewFeatured Article: “Welcome to the Virosphere” by Carl ZimmerSARS-CoV-2, also known as the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, was isolated and identified by Chinese virologists in January. However, it is only one of 6,828 named species of virus, among thousands, or even trillions, that have yet to be named.
In this lesson you will learn about the history of identifying viruses and how virologists identify and classify viruses today. Then you will participate in a citizen scientist project that involves identifying the different stages of a virus.
Warm UpWhat do you know about the structure and transmission of the coronavirus?Look at the images below from left to right. The first image shows the coronavirus and the second image illustrates what happens as the virus enters a vulnerable cell.
Can you label the rest of the images? Here are some key words you will need to use: viral RNA, viral protein and viral copies.
Hint: The fifth image illustrates a close-up version of the fourth image.
Once you have labeled the images to the best of your ability, check your answers using the original article, “How Coronavirus Hijacks Your Cells.”
As you read the featured article, apply your knowledge of the coronavirus to understand and visualize how other viruses can be identified.
Questions for Writing and DiscussionRead the article, then answer the following questions:1. How do virologists search for new viruses? How do today’s approaches differ from earlier methods of researching viruses?
2. What does the research of Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, demonstrate about the diversity of viruses in the sea?
3. How did Chinese researchers and virologists isolate and identify the virus that causes Covid-19 earlier this year? How did the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses name the virus?
4. How do viruses infect and affect humans compared to other species?5. Why is it so hard for virologists to classify viruses?
6. Why did Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland, and his colleagues create the “megataxonomy”? How have other researchers responded to his creation?
Going FurtherNow that you know about the process that virologists undertake to identify and classify viruses, you are going to participate in a citizen scientist project to identify the stages of a virus.
Diamond Light Source is the United Kingdom’s national synchrotron. The synchrotron produces bright light that scientists can use to study anything from fossils to jet engines to viruses and vaccines. In 2019, Diamond Light Source began a virus factory and enlisted the participation of the public, as citizen scientists. The first stage of this research is complete; however, you can still participate in the work of citizen scientists to study reoviruses.
According to Diamond Light Source’s Science Scribbler:Reoviruses belong to a large family of viruses that infect a wide range of animals and plants. Some members of the family cause widespread disease, notably Rotaviruses, which are responsible for serious gastroenteritis. In contrast, reoviruses themselves, whilst they pervasively infect humans, do not typically produce symptoms, indeed they are being trialled as possible anti-cancer agents, since they specifically replicate in many cancer cells activated for division. They are therefore a good starting point to try to understand the life-cycle of this family of viruses.Now you will identify and classify the four stages of the virus, following the instructions provided. Once you have completed several tasks, you can look at some of the other biology and science-related citizen scientist projects on Zooniverse and try another.",real

Biden’s Campaign Vetting Klobuchar As Potential Running Mate,"The Senator from Minnesota has been asked by the Biden campaign to submit materials for consideration. No word if she threw the binder at the staffers.

Senator Klobuchar(D-MN) is officially going through the “invasive” vetting process as a potential running mate for Joe Biden.

Klobuchar is just the latest in the list of candidates being floated.

CBS News broke the story yesterday.

Trending: After ‘Suffering In Hell’ During His COVID Treatment Coma, Drummer Rejects Satanic Beliefs The request for information from potential running mates like Klobuchar “is underway,” a senior Biden campaign aide tells CBS News. If a potential contender consents, she should be poised to undergo a rigorous multi-week review of her public and private life and work by a hand-picked group of Biden confidantes, who will review tax returns, public speeches, voting records, past personal relationships and potentially scandalous details from her past… …Biden has publicly credited Klobuchar for strong debate performances and for helping him win Minnesota, a victory that came only after she and other contenders dropped out just hours before March’s Super Tuesday primaries that helped propel Biden into the lead. He is on track to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination next month after several states hold primaries rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic… …”I need someone who’s going to be, as Barack said, ‘simpatico with me,’ who is a real partner in progress and is ready to be president on a moment’s notice,” Biden said recently. “There are a lot of women out there with the experience to do that job.” Source: CBS News

The question isn’t “Is America ready for a female Vice President”, it’s “Is America ready for a female Vice President that ate salad with a comb and made her staffer clean it after she was finished?”

Klobuchar’s anger problems are legendary–it’s the stuff of NYTimes columns and mockery in The Atlantic.

This might be the very first zero personality ticket for president in the history of the United States.

Don’t believe me? Check out Amy Klobuchar’s “joke” that she keeps telling.

Amy Klobuchar has a joke she'd like you to hear pic.twitter.com/5mh5IQepva — The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) September 6, 2019

On the plus side, Klobuchar seems to have a very good memory and if Joe forgets what he’s doing, she’ll just throw a stapler at him–or maybe one of Speaker Pelosi’s commemorative pens. (After all, she’s going to be the one pulling Joe’s strings.)

As for Joe, he’s just a shadow of his former self.

Not only can he no longer be “flirty” with women with unwanted touching and hair-sniffing because of the MeToo era and a sexual assault accusation against him, he’s just falling apart.

Here is his April 2019 video announcing that he was entering the race for President:

Joe has always been gaffe-prone, but clearly something has changed in just the past few months.

There has been a distinct decline in Joe’s mental acuity and having him locked down in his Delaware home due to coronavirus is helping him hide it. Unfortunately, he still has to do some campaigning, and when he does, it’s pretty clear that things are not so great with Joe.

Here he is forgetting who the health experts briefing him on coronavirus are–despite his near-constant use of notes.

Yikes!

He’s literally got a binder with all of his information in front of him–unless Klobuchar got her hands on it and threw it at some staffer for the Biden Virtual Rally “glitches.”

Don’t get me wrong, Klobuchar is perhaps the least insane of the Democrats that decided to run for the nomination, and wouldn’t actually be the most awful pick. She just has the likeability of a turnip. She’s also a “moderate” from a purple state and that may not go over well with the Bernie Bro/AOC/”Democratic Socialist” wing of the Democratic party. But perhaps its because “moderate” Joe has morphed into Bernie Lite and needs someone moderate to balance him out.

Whoever wins these “Veepstakes” it’s clear that their primary job will be to prop up Joe Biden.

His last two albums debuted atop the country and rock charts and each won him a pair of Grammys.

But he recorded his new album, ""Reunions,"" in what now seems like another time. It will be released Friday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

""That's not what I planned on, but I would have been super disappointed if I had to wait,"" Isbell told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Anthony Mason. ""And I think, you know, people don't need music any less right now than they will a year from now.""

He needs it even more now, he said. ""I need to feel a connection with people.""

On their farm outside Nashville, Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, have been hunkering down at home with their 4-year-old daughter, Mercy.

Mercy can tell something is different, Isbell said.

""She even kind of misses being on tour 'cause, you know, she goes on tour with us. So she's said a few times, 'Can we pretend we're in a hotel today, Daddy?' I'm like, 'Yeah, we can do that,'"" he said.

Isbell said he doesn't know when he will be back on tour.

""Sometimes I let myself think about how nice it will be to play shows again with my band and with an audience and ride around and see new things, but I don't stay there for too awful long 'cause then I get sad,"" he said.

He has found this time challenging, he told Mason. ""You know, we lost John Prine a month ago, and that's been devastating for us.""

Prine died of the coronavirus in early April. Isbell and Shires both had performed on his final album, ""The Tree of Forgiveness,"" and had toured with the revered singer-songwriter.

""When John passed, it occurred to me that, you know, there's no such thing as overreacting at this point because if John's loss had been the only one, it would still be enough to keep us in the house for however long it takes,"" Isbell said.

So, he's been performing his new music from the studio in his barn. Isbell has said that he dealt with a lot of ghosts on his new record.

""I didn't know that's what was happening while I was writing the songs,"" he said.

One of those ghosts was his own: the alcoholic Isbell before his recovery eight years ago.

""For the first few years after I got sober and straightened my life up, it was dangerous for me to forgive myself,"" Isbell said. ""Because I didn't want to turn back into that guy.""

""You're okay being with that guy again?"" Mason asked.

""Yeah, for once, and it's taken a long time 'cause, I mean, everybody has that friend that, you know, they can't hang out with 'cause it's like, if I go out with that guy tonight, I'm going to wind up in trouble. Well, that was my own self, you know?"" Isbell said.

Isbell said the pressure to live up to his earlier albums also meant ""Reunions"" had a somewhat tortured birth.

""We could have had a better time, but I don't think we could have made a better album,"" he said. ""And, you know, now the album's done. We can have a good time now.""",real

Eight Washington counties have received the OK to move forward with the second phase of reopening, which includes allowing restaurants to offer dine-in service at 50 percent capacity, according to the Seattle Times.

Gov. Jay Inslee's rules require restaurants that reopen to keep a daily log of customers, including their names and contact information. The logs are to be kept for 30 days, when they can be used to trace coronavirus infections.

There have been 17,773 confirmed cases and 993 deaths from COVID-19 in the state, according to date from Johns Hopkins University.

As businesses in the counties cleared for limited reopening get rolling, there are 13 regulations that they must adhere to.

In addition to the log, they will also be required to move tables far enough that there is a 6-foot distance between guests at different tables.

The state is also urging restaurants to require face coverings even when guests are not seated at their tables. Bar seating and buffets are not permitted.

Restaurants are required to provide hand sanitizer to staff and guests and screen employees for signs of COVID-19 at the beginning of each shift. A COVID-19 supervisor must be assigned to enforce the site's safety plans.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Voting by proxy — without being ""present"" as the Constitution requires — is an unprecedented move, which wasn't even resorted to during other challenging moments in US history.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being ""present,"" as the Constitution requires. That's about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.

The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it's partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, ""working from home.""

Members Congress clinb the steps of the House of Representatives for final votes, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, July 31, 2014. AP

""This House must continue legislating,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. ""And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.""

Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

Democrats argue the House can rely on technology for remote work as the pandemic drags on. But Republicans objected to what they see as a power grab during the crisis. The vote was 217-189.

Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the rules panel, warned the changes will fundamentally alter the nature of the institution, ""and not for the better.""

One by one Republicans lined up Friday to speak against it.

""We should all get to Washington, do our jobs,"" said Rep. Bradley Byre, R-Ala.

Under the new rules, House lawmakers will no longer be required to travel to Washington to participate in floor votes. They will be allowed to vote by proxy — assigning their vote to another lawmaker who will be at the Capitol to cast it for them. Eventually, a provision allows for direct remote voting, once the technology is approved.

Just as important, the House committees — the bread and butter of legislative work — will be able to fully function remotely. Committee hearings are prime-time for lawmakers — the chance to grill officials, spar with colleagues and have much of it captured on C-SPAN. House lawmakers will be able to draft bills, conduct oversight and even issue subpoenas from the comfort of their homes.

""This is about allowing the people's House — and the people's representatives in committees — to work,"" Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who has helped lead the effort, testified before the Rules Committee.

With the Capitol physician warning it could be years before Congress resumes full operations, lawmakers are anxious to chart a new normal and not be sidelined.

Rep. Mary Scanlon (D-PA) tweeted this ""surreal"" photo of the House chamber as members of Congress practiced social distancing during a Friday vote. Twitter/Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon

An earlier proposal was shelved two weeks ago as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted she wanted any change of this significance to be bipartisan. She tapped a task force to try to reach a bipartisan compromise.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy proposed a ""hybrid"" plan that would allow the committees to conduct work remotely but stopped short of allowing the proxy voting on the floor.

A key Trump ally, McCarthy argues if other Americans are at work, Congress should be, too. ""It's a very sad day inside this House,"" the California Republican said. He mocked Pelosi for having claimed the House would serve as the ""captain"" of the ship, last to leave during the crisis, only to go home.

The changes are expected to be temporary, only through the remainder of this session of Congress, at the end of the year. Democrats insist the changes should be used only under times of crisis.

But Republicans warn there will be legal challenges to legislation passed during this period, questioning the constitutional legitimacy of proxy votes. The House has never allowed proxy floor votes, even during some of the most challenging eras in the nation's history. Lawmakers convened during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic and only stayed away a short time after the 2001 terror attacks. Proxy votes had been allowed in committees, but that ended decades ago. Under the new rules, one lawmaker can carry up to 10 votes by proxy to the Capitol.

""You got to be here,"" said another Trump ally, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. ""You can't phone it in.""

But Hoyer, quoting President Abraham Lincoln, told his colleagues, ""We must act and think anew.""",real

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim and chief medical officer Tal Zaks dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement of what it described as 'positive' results from its vaccine trial.

The two executives pocketed almost $25 million in profits in a day's work before experts cast doubt on the vaccine's success and sent shares tumbling.

Kim exercised 241,000 options for $3 million Monday, then instantly sold them for $19.8 million, taking a tidy profit of $16.8 million, SEC filings seen by CNN Business show.

On Tuesday, Zaks exercised $1.5 million stock options before making a profit of $8.2 million when he immediately offloaded them for $9.77 million.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, after it released promising results of its COVID-19 vaccine trial

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim (left) and chief medical officer Tal Zaks (right) dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement over its vaccine trial

The biotech company released results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial Monday, after it became the first US company to start a clinical trial for a vaccine back in March.

This sparked hope that a vaccine for the deadly virus could make it to market by January and sent Wall Street investors into overdrive.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, and the company's market value climbed to $29 billion.

While investors raced to get a slice of the firm, the two insiders CFO Kim and CMO Zaks dumped the near-$30 million of shares between them on Monday and Tuesday.

According to filings, Kim also offloaded stocks in the days before the results of the trial were announced, selling 20,000 shares worth $1.3 million on May 15.

The timing of the sales may appear suspicious but Moderna insisted this week's sales from the two insiders were executed under automated insider trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.

Such plans lay out future stock trades at set prices or on set dates, with transactions typically being carried out without the insiders taking any action.

'These transactions are executing automatically pursuant to these trading plans,' the company said.

Experts have said this means the deals are perfectly legal.

Andrew Gordon, director of research services at Equilar, told CNN Business the executives' actions would only pose a 'legal issue if they created or modified their 10b5-1 plan while in possession of material insider information.

'It's not uncommon for insiders to sell shares they own, nor is it bad for them to capitalize on the current stock price.'

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the apparent success of the vaccine trials.

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the success of the vaccine trials. Dr Fauci called the trials 'optimistic'

Health website Stat cast doubt on the vaccine Tuesday, saying not enough information was available to understand if the phase one trial was a success and sending shares down to $71.67 that day.

Shares fell further to a low of $67.05 Thursday, down 16 percent from its Monday close.

Other experts have also voiced their skepticism over the trials.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Nature.com he was 'not convinced' by Moderna's claims.

'I'm not convinced that this is really a positive result,' Hotez said.

Shares then went up again Friday to $68.60 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna's vaccine.

'Although the numbers were limited, it was quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That's the reason why I'm cautiously optimistic about it,' Fauci said at a CNN town hall on Thursday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci is head of, is developing the vaccine in collaboration with Moderna.

Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of medicine which is testing Moderna's vaccine, echoed Fauci's optimism in an interview with CNBC Friday.

'I am cautiously optimistic. We are developing at a pace that has never been done before,' he said.

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19

'Trying to think that, a year after a virus has been identified, we will have a vaccine ready to deploy and ready to go into massive distribution, it's simply mind-boggling to me.

'I have to be a little cautious and say I hope it happens, but I don't want to be - I want to make sure we do it the right way.'

Moderna's phase one study of 45 participants and measuring the antibodies in eight participants found all eight had developed antibodies to the virus at levels at or above the antibodies found in people who have recovered from COVID-19, the company revealed.

Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting Chinese “disinformation” about the novel coronavirus outbreak, although WHO officials denied the accusation and China said it was transparent and open.

""If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,"" Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a letter posted bit.ly/3bNB3R7 on Twitter.

Earlier, Trump said the Geneva-based WHO had “done a very sad job” in its handling of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, and he would make a decision on funding soon.

Trump said in the letter the only way forward for the WHO was for it to demonstrate independence from China, adding that his administration had started discussing reform with Tedros.

Trump also made various accusations against China in the letter including that it tried to block evidence the virus could be transmitted between people, pressed the WHO not to declare it an emergency, refused to share data and samples and denied access to its scientists and facilities.

China hit back on Tuesday with its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, saying the letter was slanderous.

“The U.S. leadership’s open letter is filled with phrases of suggestions, maybes, and potentialities, and is trying to mislead the public through this specious method, to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,” Zhao told a regular briefing.

Zhao said the U.S. decision to stop contributing to the WHO was a violation of its international obligations.

‘REVIEW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE’

A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said on Tuesday the agency had no immediate comment on Trump’s letter but expected to have “more clarity” and a reaction to it later in the day.

On Monday, the WHO said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible and it had received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China.

The WHO, a U.N. specialized agency, is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

More than 4.75 million people have been infected globally and 314,414 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget.

This year, the United States has already paid the WHO about $58 million, senior Trump administration officials said last month, half of what it is required to pay for 2020 - known as an assessed contribution.

1697,331,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html,2020-04-15,New York Orders Residents to Wear Masks in Public,"
Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.
The order will take effect on Friday and will apply to people who are unable to keep six feet away from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, on a crowded sidewalk or inside a grocery store.
“Stopping the spread is everything,” Mr. Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”
The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.
Maryland also announced on Wednesday that it would require people to wear masks in public.Mr. Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that riders without face coverings would not be ejected from public transit. The pandemic has devastated New York’s public transit system, with 59 workers having died of the virus and 2,269 testing positive for the infection.
The state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who fail to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties: “You’re not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask,” Mr. Cuomo said.
Permitted face coverings include proper masks, as well as scarves or bandannas, the governor said.A similar rule was issued in New Jersey last week. The order, issued by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, made it mandatory for all people inside stores and other essential businesses to wear face coverings unless they are under 2 years old or have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.
Signs have popped up at stores throughout New Jersey warning customers that they will not be allowed in unless they cover their faces. Some stores have taken a stronger stance, asking people without coverings to leave.
“These restrictions that I have laid out must be followed throughout the state,” Mr. Murphy said last week. “We are taking the step to protect both customers and essential workers.”
The mandates were the latest public safety measures from two states that are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. New York and New Jersey have worked in tandem since the outbreak reached the region, shuttering nonessential businesses at the same time and recently forming a coalition with neighboring states to coordinate the reopening of their economies.
In announcing Maryland’s order on masks in public settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said, “The wearing of masks is something we may have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.”
New York, New Jersey and Maryland are so far the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the most recent information from the National Governors Association. Puerto Rico and Guam have implemented similar measures.
Nonbinding guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain to prevent the transmission of the virus. The infection spreads primarily through droplets generated when, for instance, a sick person coughs or sneezes.
That federal recommendation was issued after research showed that many people were infected with the virus but did not show symptoms.
Across New Jersey, businesses were still grappling with the enforcement of the new rules, which some people have flouted, leading to arrests in some instances.
Supermarkets have posted signs on their doors telling customers they cannot come in without a mask, but some shoppers have refused to wear coverings and laughed off the requirement, said Matt Fattah, the owner of a C-Town supermarket in Jersey City.
“A lot of people think they don’t have to follow the rules,” Mr. Fattah said. “My employees are all on board, wear masks and gloves 100 percent of the time. Customers, first few days, it was an issue. Like the bag ban, a lot of customers thought it was a joke, that we were joking.”
Earlier this week, the owners of a toy store in Lakewood, a town near the Jersey Shore, were charged with violating the order after police spotted about 10 people crowded inside the shop. Only three of them were wearing masks, according to the police.
And in Pleasantville, a town just west of Atlantic City, a 35-year-old man was arrested on several charges, including violating emergency orders, after he came into a Dunkin’ Donuts without a mask and refused to leave after employees asked him to.
Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said the police would continue to cite and arrest those who ignored orders mandating social distancing and the wearing of masks.
“Because lives are at stake, enforcement action will be taken without hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others at risk,” he said in a statement.
Mr. Murphy, the New Jersey governor, said it was up to businesses to set their own policies on how to deal with customers who do not wear a face covering.
The state order does allow people who refuse to wear a mask for medical or other reasons to enter a store and spend a limited amount of time shopping for essential goods, Parimal Garg, the state’s deputy chief counsel, explained during Mr. Murphy’s briefing on April 8.
“I think that’s benevolent,” Mr. Murphy responded. “I’d prefer to even be tougher than that.”K.C. Rondello, a disaster epidemiologist at the College of Nursing and Public Health at Adelphi University in New York, said the mask requirement would ensure compliance from those who would otherwise ignore voluntary guidelines.
“If ultimately these laws lead to greater compliance with social distancing recommendations, then they will have a very real and quantifiable effect on morbidity and mortality,” he said. “It may be difficult for people to understand or appreciate the value of a face covering. They may think, ‘What could a bandanna possibly do?’ But it can make an enormous difference.”
In New York, Mr. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, the three-day average of the number of virus patients in hospitals — considered one of the most reliable measures of the virus’s impact — fell for the first time since the outbreak began.
“All people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, “You’re now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you’re going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on.”
He added, “You don’t have a right to infect me.”Kevin Armstrong and Lauren Hard contributed reporting from New Jersey.",real

This article was originally published by John W. Whitehead at The Rutherford Institute.

“You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”—Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”",fake
1703,1495,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/05/19/trump-coronavirus-rally-open-up-lock-down-hydroxychloroquine-266476,2020-05-19,Opinion | Give Trump All the Rallies He Wants,"Given the early findings on coronavirus contagion—it spreads most readily when people are in close quarters in enclosed spaces and engaged in full-throated singing or yelling—how likely is it that even a Republican governor would do Trump a favor and approve one of his traditional rallies in his state?

Not very. Could it be that the Democratic conspiracy to shut down the rallies has co-opted the Republicans, too? Or is it just a matter of Eric Trump being full of political beans? Occam’s razor would suggest the latter and that the younger Trump’s mouth simply got out in front of his brain and lapped it a couple of times.

But maybe Eric Trump is onto something. Maybe he isn’t pitching the rally idea just as a pretext to poke his opponent in the eye. If he’s sincere about thinking the rallies should go on, maybe the president shouldn’t wait for an invitation. Maybe he should just browbeat one Republican governor into okaying a big rally and have him throw open an arena’s doors. He might want to approach Florida’s Ron DeSantis, a Republican governor who is giving some gyms and restaurants permission to open at half-capacity and has invited major sports leagues to resume play in his state. The Republican governors of Texas and Georgia, Greg Abbott and Brian Kemp, might give him a thumbs up for a rally if their efforts to restart their states is any indication of their mindsets.

Think of the potential for Trump, who has chafed under the strictures of his White House press briefings. It’d be like a mini vacation from the Covid-19 grind. No one would be nagging him with “nasty” questions about whether he was going to wear a mask on stage. No one would be wearing one. They’d probably be burning masks in the parking lot! And none of that distancing either. Let the show run for a couple of hours, make sure there’s lots of spittle-laden call-and-response between the president and his supporters; high-fives; low-fives; hand-crusher handshakes and not a bottle of sanitizer within sight.

Good for Trump’s mood and some invaluable scientific value to boot. If no one gets sick, all the MAGA-world conspiracy theories will be proven true. But if and when the Covid-19 cases arrive (and I’m betting they surely would), the contract tracers could collect data for a study that shows exactly how safe a big assembly like a rally, a sporting event, or a concert really is. The main cost would be the potential deaths of dozens or maybe hundreds of Donald Trump supporters, but it’s a risk Eric Trump seems willing to take. Come to think of it, the president might want to think twice about trying this in Michigan, where his margin of victory was just over 10,000 votes; how many supporters can he afford to lose?

In another Pirro show passage, Eric Trump called “the media” a partner in the Democrats’ strategy to use the lockdown to wound the president. The media, he said, “is effectively a propaganda arm for the Democrats.”

While it’s true that the liberal commentariat has backed the lockdown, it’s a reach to claim reporters are getting their assignments from DNC headquarters. Even so, some of the Trump faithful have long adhered to the idea that the press works for the Democrats. In the past, the president’s supporters have physically attacked journalists, most notably from the BBC, the Orlando Sentinel, and OC Weekly. Earlier this month, Trump supporters harassed reporters for wearing masks as they covered the president’s visit to the Honeywell plant in Arizona. “You’re on the wrong side of patriotism—you’re like communists,” one supporter said. On May 14, a local TV reporter got heckled while covering a right-wing group’s Long Island rally calling for the reopening of businesses. Trump himself encouraged the harassment when he retweeted the reporter’s video account and added this commentary: “People can’t get enough of this. Great people!”

On Monday, the president announced that he is taking doses of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that he has touted as a treatment and a prophylaxis for the coronavirus. “Good things are being said about it,” Trump said, despite multiple reports that it has limited to no effect and might even be harmful in combination with other drugs. As a way to strengthen the bond between himself and his supporters, Trump could pass out complimentary pills to the audience at his rallies. What could go wrong?

Living with a small crew, they will conduct scientific research with the help of virtual reality and artificial intelligence.

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration is seeking volunteers who will spend eight months locked up in a lab located in Russia's capital Moscow as part of NASA’s study on social isolation. Participants will live in small groups and the isolation may last up to a year. The project is a collaborative effort between NASA and the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

According to NASA's statement, the simulation ""will help NASA learn about the physiological and psychological effects of isolation and confinement on humans in preparation for Artemis exploration missions to the Moon and future long-duration missions to Mars"".

NASA said that all participants will be paid for the experiment. However, not everyone interested can be part of the study. Candidates should be US citizens of 30-55 years of age and speak both Russian and English fluently. They must hold an M.S., PhD, or M.D. or have completed military officer training. Nonetheless, the agency clarified that US citizens with a bachelor’s degree and relevant education and experience may also be considered.

The participants will be challenged with environmental aspects that are similar to those expected on future space missions. Living in a small crew, they will conduct scientific research with the help of virtual reality and artificial intelligence.

""Results from ground-based missions like this help NASA prepare for the real-life challenges of space exploration and provide important scientific data to solve some of these problems and to develop countermeasures”, NASA said in a statement.

Despite most people being tired of confinement within their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, social media users expressed keen interest in the project.

The trade association for the world's airlines said that demand for air travel had dropped more than 90% in Europe and the U.S. since the start of the pandemic, and warned that recovery will be even slower if lockdowns and travel restrictions are extended. ""We are asking governments to have a phased approach to restart the industry and to fly again,"" Alexandre de Juniac, the IATA's director general and CEO, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. De Juniac is hopeful that some flying will resume by the summer. ""We are aiming at reopening and boosting the domestic market by end of the second quarter, and opening the regional or continental markets — such as Europe, North America or Asia-Pacific — by the third quarter, and intercontinental in the fall,"" he said. ""So for summer we hope that you will see flights within Europe coming back, with I hope interesting prices and very safe processes of control."" The European Union's external borders remain closed to non-EU nationals until mid-June. The European Commission has recommended a phased approach for its member states to reopen borders that would start with countries with low levels of coronavirus infections.

The comments from the IATA com as travel groups are desperate to bring operations back to life and some are already rolling out plans to do so. United Airlines has expressed its aims to schedule Europe and China routes in June, Dubai's flagship Emirates Airline will recommence nine outbound routes starting May 21 and European low-cost carrier Ryanair expects to have 40% of its flights running by July 1. Budget carrier Wizz Air will restart routes from London's Luton Airport starting June 16, Lufthansa is planning service expansion in June and IAG will resume some flights in July, among others.

Mandatory quarantine 'useless'

But any hopes for a boost to the industry with some resumed travel will be dashed if governments institute mandatory 14-day quarantine periods for travelers upon arrival, de Juniac warned. ""We are advocating with governments not to implement quarantine measures that will retain people for two weeks that will arrive anywhere,"" he said. ""We think that it is useless provided we have implemented the health and sanitary controls that we are discussing with governments. It is absolutely key for the tourist industry which is so important for so many countries in Europe."" Scores of countries including Australia, New Zealand, China, Spain and potentially the U.K. are requiring international travelers to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, with varying degrees of enforcement: in Australia, arrivals are escorted to a hotel where they must remain for 14 days, while in other countries they are expected to ""self-quarantine"" at home. Hong Kong issued state-monitored tracking bracelets that arrivals must wear to ensure they do not leave their area of quarantine. Such policies will no doubt deter many people from wanting to travel. De Juniac believes quarantine periods are simply not necessary as long as airlines and airports uphold stringent sanitation and monitoring practices. ""Is it possible to have an aircraft full and without risk of contamination? Our answer is yes,"" de Juniac said, ""provided we implement control and sanitary processes for passengers just before the flight — by asking for temperature control, by the obligation to wear a mask, by cleaning the aircraft properly and disinfecting properly, by limiting the distribution of food to prepackaged food, by limiting cabin luggage to one luggage to avoid disembarking and embarking process to be too overcrowded."" With such a multilayered approach, he argued, ""you limit the risk of contamination. ... And then the quarantine is not useful from our point of view in this case.""

Women’s Aid Federation of England (Women’s Aid), which provides direct services to domestic abuse victims and engages in research and policy campaigning, has given an interview to Sputnik, outlining how the situation with domestic abuse has changed amid the pandemic. The organisation, however, underscored that the “true impact” of the lockdown may not be known until it is lifted and more abuse victims are in a position to reach out for help.

Sputnik: There have been reports of substantial increases in domestic violence in places that have implemented COVID-19 lockdowns, including in Wuhan, China, and Paris, France. Has the UK seen an increase in domestic abuse/violence since the lockdown was declared, and if so, by how much?

Women's Aid: 10 women and two children were killed by men in the first two weeks of the lockdown (between 23rd March and 6th April). This is three times higher than the average of three women killed every two weeks.

Additionally, data is not yet available to show the true impact of Covid-19 on survivors. Firstly, because it is a crime that takes place behind closed doors. Secondly, many women experiencing domestic abuse may only be able to reach out for help when lockdown measures lift.

Survivors are telling Women's Aid that abuse is escalating during Covid-19; our Survivor Survey found that 67% of survivors who are currently experiencing abuse told us that it had got worse since Covid-19. We are deeply concerned about the increased physical and emotional harm women and children experiencing domestic abuse may be facing during this period.

Sputnik: Can you explain exactly why the lockdown might exacerbate domestic abuse or violence?

Women's Aid: It is important to be clear that Covid-19 is not a cause of domestic abuse - only abusers are responsible for their horrific actions. The pandemic is clearly, however, escalating abuse, and closing down women's escape routes to safety, such as friends and family or the specialist support of domestic abuse services.

It's vital that women know that support continues to be available for them during this challenging period and that they will be listened to and helped. It is also important survivors know that domestic abuse is a crime and if you are in danger, always call 999.

Sputnik: Is there any difference between the nature of support you are providing to people during the lockdown to that which you would provide during 'normal' times?

Women's Aid: Support services are working around the clock to adapt to these unprecedented times. Refuges are supporting as many women as they can whilst facing new challenges such as staff sickness and the spread of the virus within shared accommodation. However, less than half (48.5%) of refuge service providers were able to comply with government guidance to stay open for existing service users and new referrals. Most anticipate an increase once measures are lifted, 66.7% stated they were concerned about future increases in demand.

Our direct services, which provide specialist support from domestic abuse support workers to survivors, have continued during this period and, as below, Live Chat has expanded to meet the increasing demand.

Within the first two weeks of lockdown, there was a 41% increase in users visiting Women's Aid's Live Chat site and we have doubled the Live Chat hours available to survivors during the Covid-19 lockdown. From Monday 20th April, the service has been open to survivors from 10am – 2pm Monday to Friday to provide a secure way for women to reach out and get specialist advice and support. Many women feel safer using online instant messaging with Live Chat than a phone call that may be overheard.

The Women's Aid Rail to Refuge scheme means that survivors with a refuge space can travel for free across England, Scotland and Wales. When lockdown started, the Rail Delivery Group were quick to respond to women's needs and launched a temporary, nationwide scheme.

Sputnik: What are the kinds of things that can be done to support victims of domestic abuse during this time period?

Women's Aid: For family or friends who are concerned about someone who may be experiencing domestic abuse, this lockdown period is difficult, as it means opportunities for face to face support and conversation are not available. And for survivors, it means that many routes to support outside the home are closed down [please see here for detailed advice].

Advice includes trying to keep a mobile phone on you and charged at all times and, if possible, keeping safely in touch with people you trust online or by phone – perhaps having a regular safe time they can check in with you.

And the key message is as mentioned above: please call 999 if you feel you are in immediate danger.

Sputnik: Is there a concern that people who may leave their homes seeking respite from an abusive household (as opposed to exercise) but are unable or unwilling to discuss the matter may be inadvertently targeted by the police for being outside without a 'reasonable excuse'? Are you aware of any such cases happening?

Women's Aid: ""Escaping risk of harm"" - including removing yourself from an argument - is an accepted and valid reason for leaving your home. The government and police forces have made clear that, if you are not safe at home, you are allowed to leave. And it's vital that this message continues to be clearly communicated.

Please note that leaving an abusive partner is statistically a dangerous time for a survivor and that survivors should access specialist support to help them leave safely.

Sputnik: In your opinion, are there sufficient resources being offered to organisations such as yours to deal with domestic abuse?

Women's Aid: Specialist domestic abuse services provided by Women's Aid members across the country are facing huge challenges in delivering life-saving work. After years of funding crisis, they are now experiencing a perfect storm of staff shortages, increased costs from remote working, lost fundraising income and challenges in accepting new referrals into refuges because of the risks of the virus spreading.

Together with other violence against women and girls (VAWG) organisations, we have been urging the government to deliver one simple, emergency fund for this life-saving sector.

The government's funding announcements are therefore very welcome. But we are concerned that it will not be enough to sustain the sector during this crisis, and we urge this to be kept under review as the impacts of the pandemic become clearer.

Funding must also be ring-fenced for specialist VAWG services led by and for BME women, deaf / disabled women, and LGBT survivors. These services are essential for fulfilling duties under the Equality Act and Public Sector Equality Duty, as well as meeting survivors' specific support needs, but they have been marginalised and excluded from existing funding systems.

Their inclusion, through a specific ring-fence, is essential for an equitable funding system which does not further entrench inequality and social injustice, which has been exacerbated in this pandemic.

Updated March 19 at 9:25 a.m. ET

The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the U.S. Census Bureau to temporarily suspend all field operations for the 2020 census for two weeks until April 1, the agency announced Wednesday in a statement on its website.

As the country continues to bunker down in response to the spread of COVID-19, the bureau's director, Steven Dillingham, says it is making the change ""to help protect the health and safety of the American public, Census Bureau employees, and everyone going through the hiring process for temporary census taker positions.""

For the next couple of weeks, the bureau is also reducing the number of on-site workers at two facilities in Jeffersonville, Ind., that process paper census forms, the bureau says in a separate statement on its website.

Another facility in Phoenix that also processes paper forms is ""adopting social distancing practices in line with guidance from health authorities,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, told NPR in a statement on Thursday.

Many census advocates are worried that the ongoing public health crisis could jeopardize the bureau's ability to accurately count the U.S. population this year as required by the Constitution.

All U.S. households, however, can continue to respond to the census on their own either online at my2020census.gov, over the phone or by paper form, if they receive one. Official letters with instructions on how to participate in the national head count are expected to arrive at most homes by Friday.

The announcement comes days after the bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that it is delaying deploying door knockers to college towns until April 23 and waiting until early April to start sending out census workers with computer tablets to help people complete online forms.

Still, there has been a lot of uncertainty about how the bureau plans to protect early rounds of census workers expected to go door to door to count residents in remote parts of Alaska and Maine, and in some American Indian tribal territories. Other workers were set to leave paper questionnaires in Puerto Rico and other places recovering from natural disasters. The bureau had also been preparing to conduct an in-person count of people experiencing homelessness.

Recently hired enumerators, also known as door knockers, and other field staff have been gathering around the country for training sessions. The bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that at least one employee, who was hired to be a census field supervisor, has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in quarantine.

""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, said in a follow-up email on Sunday.

While that employee has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau, the census field supervisor was in contact with a ""very limited number of employees"" at a training session, and all of them are in self-quarantine, Cook said on Saturday.

The latest state population counts are due to the president by December 31, according to federal law.

The numbers of every person living in the U.S. determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. They also guide how as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other public services are divided up among local communities.

In the written statement, Dillingham said that as of Wednesday morning, more than 11 million households have submitted a census response on their own through the Internet since March 9, when the online form at my2020census.gov was soft launched.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who helps oversee the 2020 census as the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, says she hopes more households will continue to find ways to respond to the census during the temporary pause in field operations.

""Every American should know that this does not affect your ability to self-respond,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""By responding now, you will ensure that the Census Bureau does not need to send a census worker to your door.""",real

Danish club unveil first-ever 'Virtual Grandstand' to allow fans to attend games via Zoom,"After two months without football, Danish Superliga team AGF Aarhus are now offering virtual tickets to their upcoming game against rivals Randers FC, meaning watching fans will appear on giant screens inside the stadium.

As if the world of sport hadn’t got surreal enough in these unusual times what with spectators being replaced by cardboard cut-outs and sex dolls, fans of one team in Denmark are now able to grab free tickets for their games - and cheer them on inside the ground via online chat platform Zoom.

AGF Aarhus of the Danish Superliga have announced they are erecting giant screens inside 22 sections of their Ceres Park stadium, on which the players will be able to see the faces of watching fans cheering them on from the comfort of their own homes.

Tickets are free, with 22 different sections to choose from 🎫Innovation ⚽️🖥 pic.twitter.com/E4LajIABaN — Owuraku Ampofo (@_owurakuampofo) May 22, 2020

The fans will also be able to pick sections when choosing tickets for the upcoming game against their local rivals Randers FC on May 28 that will allow them to ‘sit’ alongside their friends in the Superliga’s first game back since lockdown due to the coronavirus. So while they may not be able to actually go to the stadium, they will be able to ‘gather’ as the match begins.

The screens and technology involved will take 23 people to operate and the sections will be monitored to ensure home, away and neutral fans aren’t located on the same virtual screen. Although you would imagine the prospect of any fights breaking out must be fairly low.

AGF’s CEO Jacob Nielsen certainly seems excited about the project, saying: “It will be the first tournament match in a long time. We are celebrating that with a historic digital initiative, and we are proud to be the first club in the world to use it.

""Now it seems that we have to do without spectators for a while, so maybe we can inspire a similar initiative at other clubs that can also benefit from it in the coming time.”",fake
1736,672,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/health/coronavirus-antibody-prevalence.html,2020-05-07,"After Recovery From the Coronavirus, Most People Carry Antibodies","
A new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age, sex or severity of illness — makes antibodies to the virus.
The study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts, also hints that anyone who has recovered from infection may safely return to work — although it is unclear how long their protection might last.
“This is very good news,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the work.
Antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some protection against the invader.
Health officials in several countries, including the United States, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings like hospitals, building what researchers call “shield immunity” in the population.
But most antibody tests are fraught with false positives — picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of producing false-positive results.
Several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.
The study also eased a niggling worry that only some people — only those who were severely ill, for example — might make antibodies. In fact, the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.
Having antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But in previous research, Dr. Krammer’s team has shown that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the virus, the key to immunity.
“It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralize virus,” Dr. Rasmussen said.
Researchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be donors of convalescent plasma, antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than 15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the effort.
The new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only mild or moderate symptoms.
“To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with mild disease,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
The criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later extended that to 14 days.
The team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had at least some antibodies.
That suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect the results, the researchers said. “We weren’t looking exactly at this, but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
There was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days, she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well after symptoms begin. “What we’re telling people now is at least three weeks after symptom onset,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
Because tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719 people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been diagnosed.
In this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The majority of these people — 62 percent — did not seem to have antibodies.
Some of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza, another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg said.
“I think literally everybody in New York thinks they’ve had it,” she said. “People shouldn’t assume the fever they had in January was Covid and they’re immune.”
Other experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been diagnosed in them.
The number suggests that “in cities like New York, there are a tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,” said Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University.
An antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20 percent of city residents had been infected.
Another finding from the study — that diagnostic PCR tests can be positive up to 28 days after the start of infection — is also important, Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies, and suggest an active or waning infection.
“As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,” she said. “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.”
She and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus. Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several suspected cases of “reinfection” were a result of PCR tests picking up remnants of dead virus.
Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.
Still, Dr. Wang said, “Until we do know, it’s prudent for everyone to proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Experts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to shield it from the coronavirus.
“The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of which we should presume are yes,” said Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.
In Dr. Krammer’s previous work, to be published in the journal Nature Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.
So everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the virus, Dr. Krammer said: “I’m fairly confident about this.” Another way to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection in an animal.
But perhaps the most urgent question, especially as research on vaccines ramps up, is how long that immunity might last.
Even if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels, people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.
Immune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens, and at least one study has shown that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells. So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.
Ultimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come only with patience.“Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,” Dr. Rasmussen said, “the only way to tell that is by following these patients over time.”",real

James Dean starrer “East of Eden” (1955), crime drama “Bonnie and Clyde” (1969) and disaster film “The Towering Inferno” (1974) are among other titles playing, after Japanese chain Toho Cinemas reopened 10 of its 66 theatres in areas deemed relatively safe from the coronavirus.

The unit of Toho Co, which also runs a film studio, said it would reopen 23 more cinemas on Friday in prefectures where the government has lifted the state of emergency.

Cinemas in Tokyo remain shut.

Toho Cinemas, which had closed all of its theatres as of April 18, has implemented safety measures including keeping every other seat empty and making staff and customers wear masks.

Reopening theatres leads to another challenge, however: what films to show after movie studios delayed new releases because of the pandemic?

Toho’s reopened theatres mostly offer a mix of old Hollywood, recent Japanese hits and holdovers like Oscar-winning “Parasite” that were in cinemas before the closures, although that mix varied between theatres, its website showed.

Its Sendai cinema in northern Japan on Tuesday was screening the American classics mentioned as well as neo-noir sci-fi classic “Blade Runner” (1982), prison drama “The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) and several Japanese films including “Shin Godzilla” (2016).

Its Sun Street Hamakita theatre in central Japan’s Shizuoka skewed more towards local films headlined by multiple screenings of Makoto Shinkai’s animation megahit “Your Name” (2016) and his follow-up “Weathering With You” (2019).

But Sun Street Hamakita was also showing Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi classic “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982), romantic drama “An Officer and a Gentleman” (1982) and musical “West Side Story” (1961).

Western “Rio Bravo” (1959), starring John Wayne, was also playing in some theatres.

Asked about the selection of films on show, a Toho official simply said: “We’re playing films that are popular.”",real
1748,262,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21213159/tesla-salary-cuts-furloughs-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic,2020-04-07,Tesla is cutting salaries and furloughing workers to ‘manage costs’ during pandemic,"Starting April 13th, Tesla is cutting pay for all salaried employees in the US and placing hourly workers who can’t work at home during the coronavirus pandemic on unpaid leave, according to an internal email that was viewed by The Verge.

Salaried employees at the vice-president level and above will have their pay cut by 30 percent, according to the email, which was first reported by Electrek. Directors and above will have their pay cut 20 percent. Everyone else will receive a 10 percent pay cut, and Tesla said that workers outside the US will see “comparable reductions.” The pay cuts will last through the second financial quarter, which ends in June.

It’s unclear how many hourly workers will be placed on unpaid leave. But it is likely a significant number, as Tesla said that anyone who cannot work from home and has not been given “critical work” to do at one of the company’s facilities will be affected by the furlough. Tesla employs around 50,000 people worldwide.

There is no specific mention of CEO Elon Musk in the email. Musk, who underplayed the coronavirus threat in March and tweeted that the “panic” over it was “dumb” is a few years into a $2.6 billion compensation plan at Tesla, though he has not accepted the state-mandated minimum wage salary in the past.

A “shared sacrifice”

Valerie Capers Workman, the company’s North American HR boss, said in the email that these workers will get a specific notice via email with “additional instructions on how to apply for unemployment benefits through [their] state agency,” and that “[f]or the vast majority of furloughed employees, unemployment benefits will be roughly equivalent to normal take home pay.” They will “remain an employee of Tesla (without pay)” while on furlough, and keep their healthcare benefits.

“On one hand we are devastated by this, we all want to get back to work. On the other hand we all know we are going to get way more money from unemployment since all the extras won’t be taken out,” one hourly employee at Tesla’s Fremont, California factory told The Verge. “[We are] happy we will be able to support our families better than when we were working.”

The employee, who was granted anonymity to speak freely about the situation, said their team is also happy not to be putting coworkers’ health at risk during the pandemic.

Tesla temporarily shut down its electric car factory in California on March 23rd, along with its solar panel factory in New York. The company has also already shrunk its workforce at the Nevada Gigafactory, where it makes batteries and some parts for the Model 3, by “more than 75 percent.”

But many of those workers were on paid leave, at least until the new pay cuts and furloughs were announced on Tuesday. And Workman said in Tuesday’s email that the company won’t resume production at its US facilities until at least May 4th, which is the earliest the furloughed workers will be called back. (California’s stay-at-home order currently runs through May 3rd, but can be extended.)

“We know that the uncertainty has not been easy, and we are doing everything we can to keep you safe and informed while also navigating the changes around the world,” Workman wrote in the email. The pay cuts and furloughs are part of a “broader effort to manage costs,” she said. “This is a shared sacrifice across the company that will allow us to progress during these challenging times.”

The cuts come just a few days after Tesla announced better-than-expected sales figures for the first quarter of 2020, thanks in part to the company’s new Gigafactory in China, which was also briefly shut down in February. When Tesla announced the suspension of operations at the California and New York factories last month, the company cited its $6.3 billion cash stockpile and a recent $2.3 billion raise as reasons for shareholder reassurance.

“We believe this level of liquidity is sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty,” the company wrote at the time.

Still, even the legacy automakers are taking similar actions as they head into what is expected to be a far worse second quarter for new vehicle sales. Just hours before Workman’s email went out, Nissan and Honda announced tens of thousands of hourly factory workers were being put on furlough, adding to a growing list of people who need unemployment benefits that’s already 10 million names long thanks to the pandemic.",real

First it was the waitress whose restaurant closed. Then the waiter, the bartender, the substitute teacher, the hairdresser, the tattoo artist and the Walgreens manager.
One after the other, the tenants called and emailed their landlord, Bruce Brunner, to say they were out of work and the rent was going to be late. A week after the bill was due, some two dozen of Mr. Brunner’s 130 tenants had lost their jobs or had their hours reduced. He’s working out payment plans and using security deposits as a stopgap while directing tenants to the emerging patchwork of local, state and federal assistance programs.
“Six weeks ago, you could name your price and you’d have multiple people applying,” said Mr. Brunner, who lives in Minneapolis, where he owns and manages 20 duplexes and triplexes across the city. “Now you’re deferring and working out payment plans, and it’s only going to get worse.”
One week after the first of the month, tenants nationwide are already struggling with rents. In interviews with two dozen landlords — including companies with tens of thousands of units, nonprofit developers who house the working poor, and mom-and-pop operators living next door to their tenants — property owners say their collections have plunged as much of the economy has shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Daryl Carter, chief executive of Avanath Capital, a Southern California company with 10,000 units across the country, said his buildings reduced April rents by 10 percent. Deidre Schmidt, chief executive of CommonBond Communities, a nonprofit affordable-housing provider with about 6,000 apartments in the Midwest, expects as many as 40 percent of her tenants, most of them hourly workers with low incomes, to fall behind on their monthly bills. Joseph Razavian, a part-time landlord in Atlanta who works at a software company but owns a duplex and a triplex as investments, is bolstering his reserve fund by putting off nonessential maintenance like fresh paint and new rain gutters.
“The whole market just changed,” said Gustavo Lopez, a property manager in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Nearly 10 million people have filed unemployment claims over the past two weeks. It’s too early to gauge how broadly these numbers will translate to the loss of rent: Many tenants are within the grace period before their rent is declared late. Some can stitch things together for a while by getting deferrals, applying their security deposits or paying with credit cards.
Still, early findings suggest that April is looking bad and lend credence to Mr. Brunner’s opinion that May will be much worse. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners and developers, compiled data tracking rent payments across some 13.4 million units nationwide. It showed that through the first five days of April, 31 percent of tenants had so far failed to pay their rent, compared with 18 percent in the same period a year ago.
That lined up with surveys released by Apartment List, a rental listing service; Mynd Property Management; and Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage rentals. All showed the share of partial or unpaid rent surging to as much as a quarter of billings, compared with March or last April.
Some tenants are simply moving out. College students are breaking leases to move home. Laid-off workers are showing up at rental offices to exchange their keys for their deposits, saying they are moving in with family members.
And there is Terra Thomas, a florist in Oakland, Calif., who could pay her April rent with savings if she wanted but has decided to withhold the $833 she pays for her studio. With her usually busy wedding season shaping up to be grim, she’d rather conserve her money than pay bills now.
“This could last a long time and be really, really serious, so I don’t want to be asking myself in a few months, ‘Why did I give away my last few paychecks to rent?’” she said. “I need to know that I can eat and pay for health care.”
The $2 trillion CARES Act, signed by President Trump on March 27, should in theory help laid-off tenants keep up with the rent through a combination of expanded unemployment insurance and one-time stimulus payments. The act also included aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
But only a sliver of the money deals with housing directly. About $12 billion in grants will mostly be given to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states to support people who are homeless and sustain or increase housing assistance. There are big gaps in assistance for tenants as well as landlords, because almost all of it is directed to renters and owners already attached to some sort of government program.
For instance, much of the aid to tenants is earmarked for those living in subsidized and public housing, and much of the mortgage forbearance will benefit landlords whose loans are backed by the government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is little help to most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, or small landlords whose loans are often held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
Cities and states have tried to address housing troubles by passing eviction moratoriums, which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn’t resolve what happens in three or four months when tenants who have had little or no income are billed for months of back rent.
“Eventually the moratoriums will be lifted, and we don’t want to create an environment where low-income renters fall off a financial cliff and we have a rash of evictions,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington.
After lobbying for grants to homeless providers in the CARES Act, her group is pushing for $100 billion in direct subsidies to tenants. The National Multifamily Housing Council has called for similar aid. Ms. Yentel, in an interview, cited two objectives: to relieve tenants of rent burden, but also to support small landlords at risk of foreclosure.
For several decades, the nation’s affordable-housing stock has fallen sharply, particularly “naturally occurring affordable housing” — run-down buildings that offer low rents without government subsidy. Since much of this housing is operated by smaller landlords, Ms. Yentel fears that without any aid to landlords, the buildings could go into default and be picked up by investors who will renovate them for higher-paying tenants after the crisis subsides.
“One way or the other, we have to get aid to smaller landlords so that the precious affordable-housing stock we have still exists on the other end of this crisis,” she said.
According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, a quarter of the nation’s 44 million renter households paid more than half their income in rent in 2018. Separate research from the Federal Reserve showed four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering a sudden $400 expense, suggesting that tens of millions of tenants are just a week of missed work away from falling behind on their housing bills.
For the past four years, rent increases have helped stir a nationwide tenant uprising that led to the biggest expansion of tenants’ rights in decades. Rent control laws were enacted in New York, Oregon and California, and tenants organized mass actions, like a group of mothers in Oakland who occupied an empty house for two months to protest house flipping.
Now, after years of coordination, organizers see the coronavirus pandemic as a galvanizing force. Last week, the Right to the City Alliance, a national coalition of tenant and racial-justice organizations, held a digital #CancelRent rally to call for rents to be eliminated as long as people can’t work. Homes Guarantee, a national tenants’ campaign, has been holding weekly strategy calls. On Wednesday, a caravan outside US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis honked horns and waved signs to demand rent and mortgage relief.
“This is a moment of clarity about a broken system in which 11 million people were already paying over 50 percent of their income on rent,” said Tara Raghuveer, a tenant organizer in Kansas City and director of Homes Guarantee.
Ms. Thomas, the renter refusing to pay in Oakland, is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, an activist group associated with the house-occupying mothers. For weeks she has been trying to organize her building in a rent strike, and has gotten tenants in three other units to join her.
One is her upstairs neighbor Andrew Yen, a data scientist at an agriculture company who still has a job and isn’t worried about making his $2,500 monthly rent. He and Ms. Thomas had been discussing some sort of coordinated action, but after weeks of job losses, and walking around his neighborhood seeing “rent strike” posted on telephone poles or spray-painted on utility boxes, he decided the time was now, so he is striking in solidarity.
“I feel like rent striking is the least somebody like me can do,” he said. “I’m the tenant the landlord wants to keep, so the worst-case scenario is eviction, but I probably have a lot more wiggle room than that.”",real

The partnership lets qualified Bandsintown artists bypass the normal qualifications needed to become a Twitch Affiliate and get fast access to the live streaming platform’s monetization tools.

Canceled events are a blow to musicians who depend on income from live shows, and many have turned to “quaranstreams” to try and alleviate the financial damage. SoundCloud recently announced a similar initiative with Twitch.

Bandsintown artists with 2,000 trackers or more are eligible to apply. You’ll then have to create a Twitch channel, link it on your artist profile on the platform, and fill out a short form. (It’s linked in Bandsintown’s post.) Once submitted, the company says Twitch’s Affiliation program will contact you by email within two to five business days to get any other details needed to upgrade your account.

with tours canceled, many musicians have started “quaranstreams”

Affiliate status on Twitch unlocks monetization tools, like subscriptions and the ability to receive tips. Getting fast Affiliate approval can help out artists who need to create additional income now, with swaths of the entertainment industry ground to a halt as a result of the pandemic.

Normally, in order to qualify for Affiliate status, a Twitch user must have at least 50 followers along with at least 500 total broadcast minutes in the last 30 days, seven unique broadcast days in the last 30 days, and an average of three concurrent viewers or more in the last 30 days. This program, like the one between Twitch and SoundCloud, lets artists bypass these hurdles so they can monetize on Twitch within days.

”Twitch continues to be a great place for artists to perform and connect with their fans live,” said Mike Olson, Twitch’s head of music, said in a statement. “We’re excited to partner with Bandsintown to provide artists not only the best live streaming experience, but an opportunity for our community to support them with monetization tools that aren’t offered elsewhere.”

Bandsintown also recently launched its own Twitch channel and added the ability to push out a “watch live” notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will show up on Bandsintown, as well as Facebook pages and anywhere else Bandsintown listings appear.",real

He didn’t know his dad was fading away on a ventilator, diagnosed with coronavirus at the federal prison where he was serving time for a drug charge.

His father, also named Michael, was held at FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles and died April 19. At least half the population there has tested positive, the largest known hot spot in the federal prison system. But the first word the family received of the father’s illness was the day he died, from a prison chaplain asking if the body should be cremated and where the ashes should be sent.

“They just left us all in the dark,” Fleming said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We had to find out from the news what the actual cause of death was. It was kind of screwed up.”

WATCH: How prison has shaped one artist’s view on social distancing

The response from the federal Bureau of Prisons to the growing coronavirus crisis in prisons has raised alarm among advocates and lawmakers about whether the agency is doing enough to ensure the safety of the nearly 150,000 inmates serving time in federal facilities.

And even though officials have stressed infection and death rates inside prisons are lower compared with outside, new figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons show that out of 2,700 tests systemwide, nearly 2,000 have come back positive, strongly suggesting there are far more COVID-19 cases left uncovered.

At the same time, the Bureau of Prisons communication policies are leaving families in the dark about their loved ones’ potentially life-threatening condition.

The 59-year-old Fleming had been serving a 20-year sentence on a drug conspiracy charge. The Bureau of Prisons never notified Fleming’s family that he was taken to a hospital or when his condition declined.

“Not having the opportunity to say goodbye — that would’ve been invaluable,” the younger Fleming said. “We will never have that chance.”

Under Bureau of Prisons policy, the agency is supposed to “promptly” notify the family of inmates who have serious illnesses. But the agency, which confirmed the family wasn’t initially notified, has “discretion when making notifications,” according to a spokeswoman.

Prisons officials say they are doing the best they can under dire circumstances and following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We are doing the right things to manage our population and to keep them as safe as possible at this time when we can’t provide that assurance to our average American free public that everyone is safe and secure right now with this pandemic,” said Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who previously ran the agency twice.

As of Wednesday, 30 inmates, including Fleming, had died of the coronavirus at federal correctional facilities since late March. About 600 have recovered.

Prisons officials have daily calls with CDC officials, and CDC teams have visited several correctional facilities. As part of the plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus, officials have limited inmate movement, set up tents to increase bed space, isolated inmates at some prisons and identified others for possible home confinement.

The Justice Department obtained 20 ventilators for use at hospitals housing federal prisoners, Dr. Jeffrey Allen, the bureau’s medical director, said in an interview.

In the last week, the Bureau of Prisons has obtained more than 5,000 test kits and now has 20 rapid testing machines deployed at hot spot prisons to increase testing numbers, Allen said.

He insisted that testing was in line with current CDC guidance and that officials are working daily to discover new strategies to slow the spread of the virus.

“A lot is yet unknown about how to limit its transmission in a correctional environment, and that’s why we’re collaborating with the CDC to try to identify that sort of data that can inform our management strategies going forward,” he said.

But at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal lockup in New York City housing 1,700 inmates, there were only nine nasal swab test kits late last month, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of inmates there. Just one inmate has been confirmed with coronavirus there, according to Bureau of Prisons statistics.

Deirdre D. von Dornum, attorney-in-charge of the Federal Defenders of New York in Brooklyn, said there was a reason.

“They are not testing anyone,” she said.

At the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, inmate Guillermo Zegarra-Martinez told his attorney in an email that his cellmate tested positive for the coronavirus and was put in isolation for more than two weeks.

But Zegarra-Martinez was not tested even though he was shaking in his cell with a fever during nights while experiencing pain throughout his body in the week before his cellmate was taken out and the week after, the inmate wrote.

The sick inmate was taken out of the cell only “because he was coughing on the face of the guy” who took his temperature, Zegarra-Martinez said, according to his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff.

Advocates and even prison guards have been calling for reforms to head off outbreaks in a prison system plagued for years by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. Nearly 350 staff members have tested positive.

Staff are sent around the country to pick up shifts, and union officials say the shortages are still so severe that officers are sometimes working 24 hours in a row. At a prison in Elkton, Ohio, where seven inmates have died, the governor called in the National Guard to help supplement medical staff.

Officers worry that the protective equipment they’ve been given isn’t adequate to protect them from daily contact with inmates, especially at facilities where dozens have tested positive.

But Hawk Sawyer said the Bureau of Prisons is prepared with ample amount of personal protective equipment and supplies, including soap and disinfectant.

“We are creating and making the masks for the staff, as well as the shields and hand sanitizer and all kinds of things,” she said.

1794,1955,https://www.infowars.com/london-reportedly-set-to-cut-huaweis-role-in-development-of-5g-network-in-uk/,2020-05-23,London Reportedly Set to Cut Huawei’s Role in Development of 5G Network in UK,"A reported move to scale back a deal with Huawei has been interpreted in part as an attempt by the UK government to boost trade talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump ahead of Boris Johnson’s scheduled visit to Washington for the G7 summit in June.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to reduce the involvement of Chinese telecommunication company Huawei in the country’s 5G network rollout, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The move comes alongside plans by the United Kingdom to end its reliance on the eastern Asian country for strategic imports, including medical supplies, amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“He [Johnson] still wants a relationship with China but the Huawei deal is going to be significantly scaled back. Officials have been instructed to come up with a plan to reduce Huawei’s involvement as quickly as possible,” a source said, cited by the newspaper.

Johnson is reportedly intending to scale down China’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023, according to the newspaper.

Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, according to Reuters. Huawei has not replied to a comment request by the outlet.

The report comes ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled June visit to the US for the G7 summit, according to the Telegraph.

Cutting Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s 5G rollout is also considered a step toward boosting post-Brexit trade talks with the Trump administration, which has consistently accused Beijing of being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, The Times reported that Johnson had ordered Downing Street officials to prepare a plan to put an end to the country’s reliance on China for key goods. Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.

The aim of the effort, codenamed “Project Defend”, is said to pinpoint Britain’s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by “potentially hostile” foreign nation’s to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.

London has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.

The UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain “safety-related” and “safety-critical” networks.

Washington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country’s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.

In May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company’s hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.

Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.

The US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.

Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S., January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has given out more than $30 billion in loans to over 250,000 businesses as part of the United States’ coronavirus aid program for small businesses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a memo on Tuesday.

JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, approved more than $45 billion in new credit for its clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April, Dimon said in a memo to stakeholders.

Dimon said the size of the average loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was $122,000 and half of the loans went to companies with fewer than five employees.

The U.S. Justice Department has sent grand jury subpoenas to big banks seeking records as part of a broader investigation into potential abuse of a $660 billion emergency loan program to help small businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus, two people with knowledge of the matter told here Reuters.

Dimon, who has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, also said the bank’s strategy for returning more employees to work on-site hinges on using the latest data and information and prioritizes the health and safety of its employees.

1808,593,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/has-new-zealand-effectively-eliminated-covid-19/,2020-05-04,Has New Zealand Effectively Eliminated COVID-19?,"New Zealand has chosen strict lock downs and austerity but what is next, and what have they done to have virtually eliminated this coronavirus outbreak on their island nation, according to the nation’s leader.

""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Prime Minister Ardern said. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""

The normally very busy and active island is now basically barren in comparison since the outbreak, deserted highways are just one manifestation of their resolute response to COVID-19; under their stringent lock down orders lights are dark and patios empty at every pub, cafe, and business, while there is yellow police tape sealing off parks and playgrounds with swings and equipment being tied up and out of reach to ward off temptation, as well as trails have barriers with closed signs at their entrances.

The emptiness across this beautiful island shows that the residents here are following orders and there is not much risk of transgression other than an occasional jogger or a person out for a brief stroll to get some air. Everything is closed except a few paved paths to and from towns to get essential supplies.

Close to 4 million visitors travel to New Zealand to experience its picturesque splendor and wilderness landscape, that is approximately 80% of the resident population, but this outbreak has forced the country to close all of the sought after landscapes and its borders.

If there is a shiny spot amid the global responses to this outbreak, New Zealand just might be it. While other governments have been more than a little indecisive wavering between different opinions and actions on the best response allowing the ensuing cases of infection to soar, New Zealand has set an uncompromising science driven example.

The country banned travel from China on February 3rd and since then their trajectory of new cases looked out of control until mid March when their austerity measures seemingly have been able to bring the spread of COVID-19 to heel on the island nation.

On March 15 the country began mandatory quarantines on all visitors, the strictest policy at the time, and just 10 days later New Zealand instituted a complete countrywide lock down which included a moratorium on the domestic level. The level 4 restrictions meant that hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations and grocery stores were the only commerce allowed to be open, vehicle travel was restricted, and social interaction was limited to within households.

The Prime Minister of New Zealand made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, and was bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals to help stop any confusion or panic about the sudden austerity, while delivering and supporting the same message. She also announced a few days after the lock down that the country rather than just slowing the transmission of the virus had set a course to eradicate the virus by cutting off the arrival of new cases and choking out any existing ones with these restrictions.

“We must fight by going hard and going early,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement to the nation on March 14. “We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus. But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”

“The virus doesn’t have superpowers. Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone,” said Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, who suggests that the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other countries. “New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”

Looking at New Zealand from the outside perspective it is rather different than the indecisiveness, confusion, and whinging being seen in America, in New Zealand the entire country simply got on board with the idea as it was clearly and concisely explained to them. In this country right from day one of their lock down the streets and highways were empty, stores were closed and everyone stayed home rather than complaining like entitled children having a temper tantrum.

Since their measures were put into place, they appear to be working as their daily infection rate in this island nation of 4.9 million people has been decreasing steadily from the maximum of 146 in March to just a few cases by mid April; in all New Zealand has reported a high of 1,476 cases with 19 deaths, and on April 26th, the country experienced no new COVID-19 cases and no community transmission for the first time in 6 weeks, but 7 new cases appeared on April 30, 2020.

Even with the 7 new cases the low numbers gave the government the confidence to ease up on the country’s social distancing restrictions to lower them to Level 3 at the end of April, and Ardern pronounced that the virus had been eliminated, she later clarified that “elimination doesn’t mean zero cases... we will have to keep stamping COVID out....” Downgrading to level 3 means that most but not all businesses are being allowed to reopen provided they follow safety measures, but all that require face to face contact must remain closed until level 2 is reached.

""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""

Even though New Zealand is sounding fairly confident about eliminating this virus, the success is not guaranteed. For instance other countries such as Singapore that also appeared to have the virus under control have now been struggling with a second wave of infections, and in China which also appeared to stop the spread completely are now contending with a second wave as well.

If New Zealand has managed to contain this virus outbreak, the country will still face a long and hard road, as once they are virus free they will need to maintain the total halt on all arrivals from outside of the country or risk the chance of reinfection until the entire world has managed to snuff out the virus as well. For a country like New Zealand that is largely reliant on tourism in terms of foreign exchange earnings that accounts for 10% of the GDP and nearly 15% of their workforce that is a tough prospect. For the Kiwi economy this puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and it is forecasted that the country will be among the hardest hit nations, which may not recover until at least 2024.

Australia has also been experiencing a decline in their new cases since their peak a month ago, according to their home affairs minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand and Australia are at a comparable stage in their fight against COVID-19.

Recent surveys indicate that 87% of the New Zealand population support the way that their government is handling this crisis, and it may have been easier for citizens to fall in to tow the line in this country because in general the vast majority trusts their leaders. In New Zealand it is reported that the streets remain clean and quiet, public services are functioning, stores are well stocked, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 appears to be remote and diminishing with each passing day thanks to clear and concise leadership and the citizens cooperating by following guidelines to do their part in battling the outbreak.",fake
1815,1033,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-spreader-coronavirus/,2020-05-15,"What is a coronavirus ""super-spreading"" event?","A recent investigation showed that dozens of people were infected with the coronavirus during what is known as a ""super-spreading"" event. After a choir practice in Washington state in March, 52 out of 61 attendees became ill, 32 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus, according to Skagit County Public Health.

The investigation determined that only one person at the practice had ""cold-like symptoms"" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.

The choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events ""underscores the importance"" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a single person infects a large number of other people — sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.



Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.



The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.

""It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,"" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.



The ""world's most famous super-spreader"" was Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.

How do super-spreading events happen?

These events happen because of ""a combination of biology and setting,"" Lessler said.

An infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.

Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.

Could the infected person be asymptomatic?

Yes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.

""They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,"" Lessler said.

What is the average infection rate for the coronavirus?

Doctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered ""over-dispersed,"" Lessler said.

""When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,"" he said.

The number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.

How do we prevent super-spreading events?

The social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.

""We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,"" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.",real
1825,211,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/well/live/coronavirus-symptoms-tests-false-negative.html,2020-04-01,"If You Have Coronavirus Symptoms, Assume You Have the Illness, Even if You Test Negative","
You had some exposures that may put you at risk for coronavirus. A few days later you come down with a bad cough yourself and feel a little short of breath and really tired. You take your temperature: 101 degrees. A fever.
You suspect you might have Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The days roll into each other, and your doctor urges you to stay home unless your condition worsens. You feel pretty bad, though, and finally get an appointment.
They test you for influenza by sticking a swab far up your nose, and you are told the test came back negative, you don’t have flu. They tell you they are saving the Covid-19 tests for those who are even worse off than you are. You go home with a prescription for antibiotics, possibly because they don’t know what else to do, and read about celebrities who are testing positive but don’t seem so sick.
A couple of days later, still with fevers, you go back, and the doctors relent and test you for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. They again stick something up your nose to what feels like the bottom of your eyeball.
They tell you that the results will be available in a couple of days and you go home and wait. Finally, the results come back and you are told you do not have Covid-19. Now what?
This is a real patient’s story. In fact, it is a lot of people’s story — at least some version of it. Across the world, people with signs and symptoms of Covid-19 are testing negative and wondering what it means. They are not showing up in the statistics, and they are left in limbo about what to do next.
The problem may be with the test. Current coronavirus tests may have a particularly high rate of missing infections. The good news is that the tests appear to be highly specific: If your test comes back positive, it is almost certain you have the infection.
The most common test to detect the coronavirus involves a process known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, a jumble of words that describes a method capable of detecting virus particles that are generally present in respiratory secretions during the beginning of an infection. From a technical standpoint, under ideal conditions, these tests can detect small amounts of viral RNA.
In the real world, though, the experience can be quite different, and the virus can be missed. The best the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can say is that if you test negative, “you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected.” The key word there is “probably.”
False-negative test results — tests that indicate you are not infected, when you are — seem to be uncomfortably common. Increasingly, and disturbingly, I hear a growing number of anecdotal stories from my fellow doctors of patients testing negative for coronavirus and then testing positive — or people who are almost certainly infected who are testing negative.
Unfortunately, we have very little public data on the false-negative rate for these tests in clinical practice. Research coming out of China indicates that the false-negative rate may be around 30 percent. Some of my colleagues, experts in laboratory medicine, express concerns the false-negative rate in this country could be even higher.
There are many reasons a test would be falsely negative under real-life conditions. Perhaps the sampling is inadequate. A common technique requires the collection of nasal secretions far back in the nose — and then rotating the swab several times. That is not an easy procedure to perform or for patients to tolerate. Other possible causes of false negative results are related to laboratory techniques and the substances used in the tests.
So, where does that leave us? Even with more testing, we are likely to be underestimating the spread of the virus. For now, we should assume that anyone could be carrying the virus. If you have had likely exposures and symptoms suggest Covid-19 infection, you probably have it — even if your test is negative. We should all continue to practice the behaviors — rigorous hand washing, not touching the face, social distancing — that impede its spread. And we need better information about the performance of these tests — including any new tests that are introduced — in the real world.
Even as better tests emerge, we should always put the test result in the context of the other information we have. It’s a lesson that endures throughout medicine: Look at the big picture, not a single piece of data. Triangulate on the truth, using all the sources of information you have, no matter how good a single test. And don’t be shy about questioning a conclusion that doesn’t fully fit the facts.

CruiseCritic.com

With the coronavirus pandemic shutting down the cruise industry for several months, Caribbean islands have been left in limbo, facing hard choices on what comes next, when and if cruise ships return.

Most islands in the Caribbean are highly dependent on tourism, with cruise ships and the related services that they provide responsible for a large percentage of jobs for residents. While the mid-March shutdown came after the Caribbean's high season, a full summer without the regular work that cruise ships bring in could have lasting economic consequences.

At the same time, most islands have limited health care facilities; an influx of coronavirus cases from tourists, both on land or sea, could prove devastating to residents. Discussions on the islands are centering on that paradox: how to bring back the tourists who fuel the economy without endangering the people who live there.

CruiseCritic.com is checking in with major ports in the Caribbean to see how the conversations are going. Here's what the cruise website is hearing.

U.S. Virgin Islands

Home to St. Thomas, one of the Caribbean's busiest cruise ports, the U.S.V.I. have been under the same health restrictions and warnings as parts of the United States and have been following regulations set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Tourists will be permitted to return to the islands June 1, but cruise ships won't come back until much later, as the lines work out their agreements with the CDC, Joseph Boschulte, Commissioner of Tourism for the territory, told Cruise Critic in an interview.

The mid-March timing of the cruise line shutdown came after most of the islands' high season, which runs from November through the end of March/early April, had already occurred, Boschulte said. Still, the revenues stopped from mid-March on, leaving the island without the crucial spring break income and run up to the Easter holidays, he said.

""We have gone from a trajectory of having a little over 1.5 million cruise customers in the territory for this fiscal year … and then we went to zero,"" Boschulte said. Summer traditionally has been a softer season for the Caribbean, but St. Thomas still averages between 100,000 to 115,000 cruise visitors in May and June; those two months alone represent a loss of nearly $36 million.

The Virgin Islands government and tourism interests have been talking regularly to the cruise lines about their plans to return, both individually and through the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. Discussions center around how lines not only can ensure that passengers stay safe from COVID-19 during port stops, but also how the island can protect its residents from getting ill, Boschulte said.

Testing for the virus has become a cornerstone in requirements for lines returning, but questions remain as to who does it – and when – the minister said. ""What do we do after they come back from touring or on the beach – do we test them before they go back on board or does the ship?""

Any excursion that takes place in St. Thomas will have to follow local health and safety protocols, Boschulte said. ""Even when the bars and restaurants open, the expectation is that you will wear a mask,"" he said. Shore excursion operators and even the popular ferry to St. John could also require masks. ""The next layer of questions become, 'Do (passengers) have to bring their own, or will the shore excursion company provide it?""

Boschulte also notes the island will need time to prepare safely, to make sure that residents who interact with tourists have the equipment they need, such as masks and hand sanitizer. ""That's taxi people, that's people who work the security at the gates, that's people who work the beaches, the restaurants and the bars.""

Another big unknown that will affect St. Thomas: What will capacity be on the first ships that arrive? St. Thomas is a port for some of the industry's largest ships, such as Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, which carries up to 6,000 passengers. ""Now if they only sail at 50% capacity, that's a much different model for us a port to manage,"" Boschulte said.

""Until we get a vaccine, I think we are going to have to err on the side of most caution,"" he said. ""What I can tell you is that we're cautiously optimistic that over the next few months, we will get closer to having adequate testing and a very thorough protocol safety set of initiatives for the cruise industry that we, as travelers, can have confidence in what's being put in place, and also that the residents of a highly traveled cruise ship destination feel comfortable that guests coming back in doesn't jeopardize the quality of their health.""

Puerto Rico

A home port for Southern Caribbean cruises, Puerto Rico was expecting 108 cruise ships in San Juan between May and September 2020. While the island is still evaluating the exact loss in revenue, the impact is being felt by a diverse group of businesses, including retail shops, tour operators, transportation businesses, harbor bunkering services and local suppliers.

The process of safely welcoming visitors again has been a top concern; the island has 80,000 people employed in tourism, which makes up 6.5% of Puerto Rico's GDP, Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, told Cruise Critic.

He noted that the island was the first U.S. destination to implement measures such as an island-wide curfew and thermographic cameras to take temperatures of travelers coming into Puerto Rico at the San Juan airport. Other measures include implementation of intensive screening, enhanced sanitation, quarantine zones, on-site medical personnel and additional disinfection of local facilities.

Expect to see buffets, salad bars and self-service restaurants eliminated in tourism businesses, Dean said. Reusable menus will not be available. Lodging for pre- and post-cruise stays will have island-specific certification cards, and guests will receive a health and safety guide from each property.

Puerto Rico is well poised as a destination that can return in the post-COVID-19 world, Dean said, pointing out the island's abundant outdoor attractions and beaches.

""The Puerto Rican community has hospitality in its DNA and will undoubtedly welcome visitors back with open arms and the warmth that it did following past adversity,"" he said.

St. Kitts

With fantastic beaches as well as UNESCO historical sites, St. Kitts has become an important and popular stop on Caribbean cruise itineraries, on both Eastern and Southern routes.

The island was projected to receive 45 cruise calls between May and September 2020, with 166,936 projected passengers. The loss of that income, based on cruise passenger spend alone, is more than $18 million, according to Racquel Brown, CEO of the St. Kitts Tourism Authority.

""We began to see an impact as early as February and March to our cruise sector, which makes up a significant portion of our tourism industry as a whole and contributes approximately $136 million in passenger spend alone to our economy per year,"" she told Cruise Critic. ""Add to that about another $7 million including passenger fees, fuel charges, taxes, navigation services and so on, so the scope of the economic impact becomes very clear.""

Cruising has helped St. Kitts grow a bustling summer tourism season, with at least two ships a week. ""There are many of our nationals who depend on the cruise industry, and the impact has been felt greatly. It has affected our vendors, who depend on the industry for their daily living, our beach vendors, our water sports operators, our taxi and tour bus operators and our hotels. Business owners have had to reduce staff hours or lay off staff. This has been difficult, as they have grown over the years from St. Kitts' vibrant cruise industry and at present there is no demand to sustain the amount of business they have grown accustomed to transacting.""

The island country, which includes sister Nevis – a port for small and luxury cruise ships – has been working with the FCCA and other Caribbean countries for a ""careful and phased"" reopening plan, she said.

""The ability to meet the established CDC guidelines will be our first step to the cruise sector resuming business,"" Brown said. ""As a destination, we will adhere to CDC guidelines and protocols for the cruise industry as well as the guidelines provided by our Ministry of Health,"" which follows World Health Organization protocol.

""Of course, we know that social distancing protocols will have to be observed, the use of hand sanitizers, the washing of hands and the use of personal protective equipment in order to ensure the safety of our guests and our citizens and residents.""

What makes the COVID-19 crisis different from the hurricanes that often disrupt Caribbean tourism is the sheer scope, she said. With hurricanes, governments have emergency plans in place, and tourists often visit as soon as they can to help support the destination, which gives the country some level of control.

""The entire cruise industry is closed, the borders are closed. We have never had a no-sail order that has restricted the entire cruise sector,"" she said.

While some islands might take the pause to consider issues of overtourism, Brown said that St. Kitts built cruising gradually and sees its growth as controlled. ""The people of St. Kitts enjoy and appreciate the cruise industry and look forward to the time when we can safely welcome visitors to our shores again.""

He was never alone for long.

Inevitably, someone would spot the legendary high school football coach and stop by to say hello, to share a story, but most often to ask his advice.

“He couldn’t be out there 10 minutes before someone would come up,” said his son, Wayne Reese Jr. “I would hear the stories all the time. Just the other day someone told me, ‘You know, your father is the reason that I am the man I am today.’”

In New Orleans, a city weathered both by natural and socioeconomic storms, Coach Reese was both a pillar and a safe harbor.

He knew success on the field – amassing 250 career wins and seeing players like hall-of-fame running back Marshall Faulk reach the NFL – and off it, where he coached generations of young people – now lawyers, general contractors, bus drivers and educators – on how to win at life.

Spring was typically the time when Reese and Frank Daggs, 42, his longtime assistant coach at McDonogh 35 High School, took their players around the region to watch college scrimmages. They were opportunities for the kids to see what it took to play at the next level and to connect with coaches and scouts who might have scholarships to offer.

But by March 13, the day Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered all state schools to close in response to the coronavirus, Reese was suffering the symptoms of what he thought was a cold.

Less than three weeks later, on April 2, he took his last breaths from a ventilator in a makeshift coronavirus wing of Tulane Hospital in New Orleans. He was 75 and is survived by his wife, Stella Chase Reese, and four children and six grandchildren.

A month after Reese’s death, current and former players said they miss their coach’s presence the most. “When Coach Reese talked, you listened,” said Clifford Chattman, now a 22-year-old senior defensive back at Texas A&M.

Chattman was 13, a shy, indifferent student, when Reese came to his seventh grade class and spoke with the boy, already a star on his rec league football team. During the meeting, the coaches didn’t talk with him about football, and they didn’t try to recruit him. Reese simply asked the boy about himself and how he was doing in school.

“He didn’t even know whether I would be playing for him then,” Chattman said. “So for him to already be known as this legendary coach, and he shows up at my school, and he’s there to see me? That told me a lot about him right then.”

After Chattman came to play at McDonogh 35, Reese was unrelenting about the importance of good grades and taught Chattman to ask his teachers for help if he struggled in class. When colleges came recruiting, Reese urged him to pick the school where he felt most at home. Chattman will earn his bachelor’s degree this summer in youth development.

“Coach told me, ‘No matter the situation in life, just be yourself. You’ll always go the furthest in life by being yourself,’” Chattman said.

For Reese, that meant being the rock that everyone around him could lean on. They saw it three years ago when one of his players, Devin “Duke” Winters, passed away from a sudden heart attack the morning he was supposed to leave for a visit to Syracuse University.

Reese was returning from a coaching seminar when he heard the news, his friend and athletic director Kevin Sanders said. Instead of going home, Reese and the other coaches huddled at school to brainstorm how best to support Duke’s family and classmates.

Sanders said he never saw Reese shed a tear for his fallen player; he was too busy being the shoulder for others to cry on. “The school is a safe haven for most of the kids,” Sanders said. “As a PE teacher, (Reese) basically touched every student in the building.”

Up until the day Reese left his office for the last time, Sanders said the coach had a photograph of Winters in his window. His voice welled with emotion as he recalled his son recently pointed out that April 2, the day Reese died, was also Duke’s birthday.

“He said ‘Duke got the best birthday present ever,’” Sanders said. “‘He got his coach back.’”

In the end, Reese never told his son anything was wrong. Wayne Reese Jr. always had to go to his mother to learn if anything was wrong. She told him his father wasn’t feeling well.

The last time he spoke with his father, Reese Jr., also a high school head coach who twice went head to head with his father’s teams, had to hold back his own tears as his father told him that all he wanted to do was go home.

“I had to tell him: ‘You’re not the coach right now, you’re the player. And the doctors, they’re the coaches. So if they say you have to stay there right now, then that’s what you have to do.’”

After his death, Reese’s students, colleagues and friends organized a drive-by caravan around the school to honor him within social distancing rules.

A trumpet player from the school’s band played the alma mater next to the school’s marquee, which bore Reese’s name along with a tribute that read: “The man, the legend, our coach!”

What breaks his son’s heart is that his father, who spent most of his life surrounded by people, died in the hospital bed without family and close friends.

Even now, he says, his father's spirit is not far from him. Its echoes are in the words he shared with generations of students and with those who couldn’t pass without stopping by the coach’s front porch to seek his counsel.

“With things I’ve dealt with just these past few weeks, in my mind, I’m thinking, what would my dad do?” Reese Jr. said. “And sometimes I’ll just look up and say ‘Daddy, talk to me.’ Because he always had all the answers.”

Thirty-two companies responded to the survey, and that’s just a fraction of the state’s dance organizations. In Chicago alone, See Chicago Dance reports having more than 88 members, and at least 100 additional companies use its marketing resources.

Put simply, the state’s dance scene has taken a body blow. Indeed, industry leaders fear that some companies won’t recover from this crisis at all and others could come back in a weakened or reduced form.

“Not only the Joffrey, for all of us, it’s a precarious time,” said Ashley Wheater, artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet. “And the arts are so fragile as it is.”

Kevin Iega Jeff, co-founder and creative director of Deeply Rooted Dance Theater, believes his company can get by as long as the restrictions related to COVID-19 conclude by May. “If it goes beyond that, then we are starting to get into real trouble.”

One ray of hope could come Wednesday. State and city officials are expected to announce a relief fund for the Illinois cultural sector to be administered by the Arts Alliance. Funds would come from the City of Chicago and private and corporate donors.

In addition, the recently passed $2.2 trillion stimulus bill includes $75 million each for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for Humanities. These agencies will distribute 40 percent to state and regional arts agencies for re-granting, and the rest will go directly to applicant organizations nationwide.

Moreover, according to Americans for the Arts, qualifying arts organizations will be able to apply for other emergency help contained in the stimulus bill. Such aid includes $5 billion in community development block grants and $350 billion in emergency loans from the Small Business Administration.

“I do think if there is not a concentrated effort to support arts organizations through this, they will be missed,” said Vershawn Sanders-Ward, founder and artistic director of the Red Clay Dance Co. “People won’t really realize it until we’re on the other side of this and they see who is no longer there for their community.”

According to the Arts Alliance survey, nearly 2,500 dance performances and programs statewide have been affected by the COVID-19 shutdown. Here is a quick look at its impact on six Chicago companies:

Deeply Rooted Dance Theater (annual budget, $1.1 million) . The company, which marks its 25 th anniversary in 2021, expects to take a $700,000 hit. It announced March 25 that it was postponing “GOSHEN,” an ambitious new collaboration with Broadway in Chicago that was to include possible touring.

Ensemble Español Spanish Dance Theater (annual budget, $1.2 million).

The company, which champions classical Indian dance, has been forced to cancel performances set for March, April and May. It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July.

It hopes it won’t have to nix its annual summer dance camp, which earns the company $130,000, in late July. Red Clay Dance Co. (annual budget $311,000). The company has had to eliminate its spring program, “Visions and Voices,” and its annual fundraiser, which annually nets as much as $10,000. If it cannot restart its programs by the end of June, it expects to take a $70,000 hit.

With all these cutbacks, dancers are hurt the most. Deeply Rooted, for example, has had to furlough its dozen dancers and is trying to find a way to give them at least some partial remuneration. Joffrey is keeping its 46 dancers on salary through April 3, then hopes to shift the remaining three to four weeks of their 40-week contract to the summer.

To get through this tough time, dance companies are falling back on cash reserves and slashing expenses. Ensemble Español is considering a GoFundMe campaign, and Red Clay plans to seek emergency help through on-line and texting fundraising platforms it already has.

At the same time, organizations are looking to their long-time supporters for supplemental assistance. Joffrey’s canceled spring fundraiser, Center Stage, has turned into what Wheater calls an “un-gala,” because many attendees are still giving the amounts they committed to the event.

Besides turning to the internet as a way to simply stay in touch with their audiences, some companies, such as the Natya Dance Theatre, are using Zoom and other on-line platforms as a way to keep classes going and maintain some revenue. But artistic director Hema Rajagopalan concedes it has been tough for many reasons, including students not having viable spaces to move at home.

Despite all these challenges, company leaders are trying to stay as positive as possible. Perez is already looking ahead to Ensemble Español’s upcoming 45th anniversary.

“We’ve got to continue to do that,” Perez said. “Move forward. Think ahead. I know this is a setback. It is a new normal that we’ve been hit with, but I think it is so important to keep the art form going.”

We have become part of a mass scale human experiment in government control and it turned out that stripping away our freedom wasn’t all that difficult. Under the guise of concern for our health and well-being, tyrants came out of the woodwork. Our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and our lives are being destroyed as the left solidifies and expands their oppressive powers. We’ve been herded around like cattle, threatened, isolated, confined, silenced, and arrested. You name it, it’s happening.

You tell me if what follows sounds like the United States, or China.

We’ve been told who can work and who can’t, with language that separates us according to who is and who isn’t “essential” as the almighty State supersedes individual rights and the family unit.

We’ve been physically and verbally harassed, threatened, fined, detained, arrested, jailed, and/or placed in forced quarantine. Business licenses have been revoked. Going to work without the permission of the government is now a crime. So is going to the park or a beach. Children playing together is also in defiance of the government. So is placing flags on the graves of veterans. The list of infractions goes on and on and on and on. Examples read like the manifesto of a demented madman. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

A talking drone warns Savannah, GA residents to maintain social distancing (YouTube screen grab)

Stay home. Do not go out. Do not earn money. Do not pay your bills, feed your family, maintain your credit rating, live your life. Do not make a single move without permission from the State or you will be punished.

Do not dare go to church. They have been shut down, some threatened with permanent closure. Even services that maintained social distancing were not tolerated. (here, here, here, here, here)

Religion cannot thrive in a totalitarian state, as the state must reign supreme.

Meanwhile, as churches are closed, jails are opened -- criminals are released en masse, including child predators, rapists, and murderers. Prisoners, wise to the ruse, are now intentionally infecting themselves so they can be released early. And the left can’t get enough of it. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

In several places, our right to protest has been stripped away as has our right to promote protests. Tech tyrants are involved, shutting down social media for those trying to spread the word about peaceful gatherings. The Bill of Rights has been set on fire and tossed off the top of a skyscraper as a police state rushes in. (here, here, here, here, here, here)

We’ve been subjected to inhumane separations, as the oldest among us are left to suffer alone in nursing homes, senior care facilities, and hospitals where there is often an impenetrable wall of secrecy surrounding patients.

Meanwhile, “contact tracing” has become the next frontier to advance the police state as fascist tech gets in on the act, tracking our every move. The government will hunt you down, find you, and force you and other members of your household to stay in your home, even if there’s no food in the house. The quarantine cycle could leave an entire household locked up for weeks and weeks on end, with no end in sight as we are essentially placed under house arrest. Strategies for how to identify people who’ve met certain criteria have been discussed, including government issued armbands. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

To help the government keep us in line, we’ve been encouraged to snitch on our neighbors and hotlines have been set up for us to do just that. (here, here, here, here, here)

And in keeping with the good for me, but not for thee reality of all oppressive regimes, many prominent leftists have broken their own rules so they could meet their lover, go golfing, take a walk with their family, get a haircut, and so on, all the while pointing their fingers and admonishing us little people to stay inside and do as we’re told. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

For the most part, law enforcement has been willing to follow these tyrannical orders, often with multiple officers arriving on the scene.

As for the American Civil Liberties Union, not only are they missing in action, they’re part of the cabal of tyrants with upside down values, evidenced by the message featured on their home page which states their priorities as follows:

“…protect voting rights, demand that vulnerable people in prisons, jails and immigration detention centers be released, and fight to ensure reproductive health care remains open and accessible to all who need it…”

In other words, voter fraud, prisoner release, illegal invader released, and abortion. (here)

All of this unfolds against the backdrop of an aggressive media campaign to parrot China’s talking points, replete with lavish praise for the communist regime that waged war against the entire world. There’s been a cascade of fools eager to align themselves with WHO and China, including many prominent individuals. The rush to embrace our enemies has resulted in silencing speech, as words such as “Wuhan flu” are deemed “hate speech.” Punishment to be determined. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

And while the lust for power underpins this shocking spectacle, it’s wrapped up in the guise of “safety.” Who could possibly question a doctor in a white coat touting such an idea? No good totalitarian regime would be without its idealized worldview to sell fools down the river.

And so we’ve sailed, as our economy has collapsed, Americans have been controlled, law enforcement has complied, and people are bombarded with fearful messages every hour of every day – messages riddled with distorted information and lies, from bogus models to inflated mortality rates and everything in between, all of which serve to strengthen the left’s case against Trump while corrupt hospital administrators rake in money from cooking the books on cause of death. But perhaps more than that, it’s easier to control people who feel desperate and afraid. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

An exhausted and increasingly impoverished populace does not a healthy nation make. In fact, if you think this is bad, what could await is even more terrifying. As Dennis Praeger wrote in March:

…Economic disasters rarely remain only economic disasters. To give a particularly dramatic example, the Nazis came to power because of economics more than any other single reason…Nazi success at the polls was almost entirely related to the Weimar economy. Communist parties don’t fare well in robust economies, but they’re very tempting when people are in dire economic straits. Only God knows what economic dislocation the shutting down of American and other Western economies will lead to. I am not predicting a Nazi or communist ascendancy, but economic and political disaster may be as likely, or even more likely, than a health disaster.

It is quite apparent by now that even if the most horrific scenario as described above does not unfold, we have already sealed our fate with respect to a disaster of monumental proportions that runs the gamut from increased drug and alcohol addiction, increased domestic violence, suicide, and avoidance of medical care, among other concerns. Tragically, the things that put human beings at risk for many of these dire outcomes are the very things that are being thrust upon us: unemployment and isolation. At the same time, one of the most powerful forces that serves as a protective factor offering comfort and hope has been denied us, as Americans have been barred from attending church. (here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here)

As for the oft-cited idea that we are at war with an invisible enemy, I would say, no, we are not. When nations go to war, they do so to defend their culture and way of life. Instead, we are destroying ours.

But there is a war being waged. The left is determined to take this nation down and the perfect time arrived to go in for the kill. Maximum suffering, pain, and destruction is on the menu and they’re serving it up every day as they plunge small towns, cities, counties, and states into protracted lockdowns and shifting goalposts.

The scale of human suffering and the long-term effects of this are incalculable. They will not be seasonal, like a virus. They will be long-lasting. And the left cares not a bit.

There is one thing and one thing only they desire: power. And they’re having at it. So far, the police state has been a wild success.",fake

But nature can be a guide to us at this time, providing a model of cooperation, a place to heal, and ways to connect, even at the recommended distance.

Opinion

In nature, cooperation abounds.

As author Peter Wohlleben, of “The Hidden Life of Trees” explored, “[trees] send distress signals about drought and disease, for example, or insect attacks, and other trees alter their behavior when they receive these messages.” While social distancing feels like a sacrifice now, the stay at home order has saved countless lives, from high-risk populations to medical and service professionals. Altering our behavior at this critical time, just as nature does in the face of challenges, is community resilience in action.

Even at a safe distance, nature heals.

One study after another documents its positive effects on physical and mental health for people of all ages and backgrounds. Nature offers balm and solace to the weary — being a source of beauty, wonder, and inspiration. And nature can be found everywhere — including in the trees outside your apartment or home.

Nature connects us.

Looking out your window you can see it, as the birds have begun their grand migration through our region. Living in a major flyway, residents can experience this annual spectacle, just as those thousands of miles away experienced it, reminding us just how interconnected we are.

As we collectively wade through this worldwide pandemic, nature’s resilience should serve as our guide. Through collective cooperation, connection and healing, we will overcome this moment and thrive as nature blooms today.

It is only right that we take this time to reconnect with it.

On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a joint plan to boost EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis after weeks of discussions on how to deploy the billions of euros needed to end the economic shock and recession.

The plan promoted by France and Germany calls for the creation of a €500 billion recovery fund able to offer grants to the worst-affected countries and regions.

IFO Institute President (Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich) Clemens Fuest has supported the German-French initiative to help the EU and offered his views on the matter during an online press conference with the Association of Foreign Press in Germany (VAP).

Sputnik: What do you think of Macron and Merkel’s new plan to restore the EU through the European Commission? We can already see resistance to these plans. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden insist that the EU only issue repayable loans, not subsidies. How can you explain the changed position on the part of the federal government? The federal government also spoke out against the so-called corona bonds.

Mr Fuest: What has been agreed here doesn’t really concern corona bonds. Corona bonds were not a clear, clearly defined concept, while what has been proposed is a clear, feasible concept. I very much welcome it. I think it’s important that Germany and France have come forward with a common initiative, the two states that quite often have different positions regarding EU finances, the two states that are very important to promote issues. Of course, other countries are also important and should be involved in this matter.

If we compare this with corona bonds, the corona bonds initiative, in my view, was a domestic policy initiative of the countries that presented this plan. They publicly demanded something from other states, knowing that they would refuse. It originally was something non-working. And such a policy, in my opinion, is taking place in Europe for domestic political reasons and is not constructive at the European level.

I think that this initiative is constructive. A model has been agreed that can be implemented. The huge challenge that we are facing regarding this fund is to show that the costs that are coming up here have added value due to distribution at the European level.

This means that it’s necessary to show that if the EU spends this money, it will be more beneficial than if member states lend money and spend it themselves. They could do that too. Member states must guarantee these debts. And the EU has virtually no income of its own.

Therefore, it’s all based on member states guarantees. And it must be shown that this European fund, the money that is given out, is more useful, that this money is used on things that national expenses cannot provide.

There is considerable potential for the aforementioned European added value. For example, the added value may consist in the fact that all this will become insurance. That money will go to countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis. We have some ideas in this regard. But we still don’t know exactly how much states will be affected.

According to the IMF forecast, Germany has a negative growth of seven percent, and France has a negative growth of eight percent. In Italy, negative growth is nine percent. According to the IMF forecast, this means that these three states have been affected to a similar extent. We don’t know whether things will get to this; it’s still unclear who will get this insurance money and who will pay it.

If the whole thing is organized in such a way that those who are hardest hit, but who can insure themselves against this crisis, get something, it is creating added value. A nation-state cannot insure itself.

But it wouldn’t help if all member states were hit equally. An insurance community where everyone suffers the same doesn’t help. However, added value will appear if the crisis is asymmetrical.

In the end, solidarity is also added value. This means that there is interest on the part of all European states that no country will collapse economically or destabilize. And that could also be European value-added. But, nevertheless, it won’t be easy to try to really spend money better than national money. This will need to be well demonstrated. If it works, this is very good.

I think the initiative for this fund at the European level is so important because it is a political signal that the EU is alive, that the EU is acting in a crisis like this. That is a very important signal. A signal that the EU will still be there after the crisis is a signal to everyone. It’s vital for the EU that certain actions are being taken here and that we can count on success.

On Political Debate

I expect political debate in parliament, as well as in other European countries. They are also very important, namely regarding where the will money be used and how it be determined that added value appears. What does this mean for future debt policy in Europe?

We need to understand that Rubicon is crossed here. It is fundamental reform, extensive debt financing at the European level. This will raise the question of whether the whole thing will be a dam break, whether we’ll have a sharp rise in public debt because we have a new level at which we also incur government debt, namely the European level.

It’s a very serious question. The answer given in the German-French document is correct. It says that there will be a repayment plan for these debts. And member countries must pay for it.

There will be such a repayment plan that, I hope – that would be right – in the event of the next crisis, the state debt quota in Europe as a whole – national, regional and European – won’t be higher than before this crisis. It will be better if it is lower. All of these issues will be discussed.

Question from France: Is this initiative Merkel’s answer to Macron?

I don’t think this is Merkel’s response to Macron, because this is the response to the crisis. The German-French document says a lot about European health policy. It’s necessary to create response groups.

It would be great if we had them when the pandemic broke out. This fund is a unique thing, a unique debt mechanism. It remains to be seen whether it will remain unique. After a while, new requirements for further debts will appear.

And this will lead to contradictions. Critics both in France and in my country, of course, will say that this is a dam break. Today they borrow, and tomorrow someone will want to borrow again. I think this is one of the risks you are taking.

I personally think that having weighed everything, it’s right to take risks.

Question from France: Is this the best initiative?

You can put down lots of possibilities on a blank piece of paper. I think this is a very good initiative. But many questions remain open. The package’s effectiveness will depend on how long it lasts. We must remember that EU decisions need to be ratified.

This begs the question: should it be ratified? Could it be that we will have a long-term ratification process, and these funds will come when the crisis has long ended? One can only hope that everyone understands this; there is an urgency for everyone involved.

But these are all open questions. This concept should be specified.

The EU needs to show signs of life. The fund should be created and it should become successful because it’s very difficult to imagine that the EU won’t do anything in this crisis. Critics will need to be convinced by showing that added value is created for everyone.

Question from Ukraine: is €500 billion a lot?

€500 billion amounts to about three percent of the EU’s GDP, maybe a little more. This is the amount paid over several years. This means that this is not a giant fiscal package, but it is a lot of money, first of all, compared to the current EU budget, which is a little more than one percent of GDP per year. For three years, this would be a doubling of costs.

The money should go to European programmes and it will be spent as part of the EU budget. Compared to what we are doing in Europe today, what is the EU budget, this is a lot of money.

Compared to national budgets, this, of course, is not that much. But the concept that money needs to be spent correctly is more important than the amount. In the German-French initiative, I understand it this way: here we are talking about spending within the EU budget, not about loans to someone there.

But the Silicon Valley automaker fought to keep the factory open after that announcement as well, according to new emails obtained by Protocol. It also came after the county’s health officer decided that keeping the plant open was a “public health risk.”

The emails were sent by the local police chief to Tesla’s senior policy advisor, Dan Chia. Each one includes a letter memorializing calls and virtual meetings between Tesla and local city and county officials. They help shed light on the deliberations between the company and the authorities about whether the factory was an “essential business,” which would have allowed it to stay open following the county-wide (and eventually state-wide) shelter-in-place orders meant to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tesla’s argument to those local officials, and to its own workers, has been that the company believes it should be considered “national critical infrastructure,” according to public guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA. CISA issued guidelines outlining what it considered to be critical infrastructure in 2015 that included “vehicles and commercial ships manufacturing.” But in a March 28th memorandum about the novel coronavirus pandemic, vehicle manufacturing is not specifically listed in the “critical manufacturing” section of CISA’s guidance. At the same time that Tesla was making this argument, every other major automaker ceased manufacturing operations in the US.

Tesla wanted to stay open because it believed it was “national critical infrastructure”

Tesla tried to convince city and county officials of this in the days leading up to the shutdown announcement, and asked to be deemed an “essential business” so it could keep producing the Model 3, Model S, Model X, and the Model Y (which the company had just started delivering) at the California factory.

Kimberly Petersen, the chief of police in Fremont, California (where the factory is located), told Chia on March 18th that the county’s interim health officer had decided Tesla’s factory was not essential, according to the emails, meaning it would have to abide by the March 16th shelter-in-place order and stop operations. The county health officer also told the city that keeping the manufacturing plant open and making the 10,000 or so workers report in would be a “public health risk,” though it’s unclear in the emails if this was specifically communicated to Tesla. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The next day, Chia and a number of other Tesla executives told the city in a virtual meeting that the company would comply with the order. “I would like to reiterate that the City of Fremont highly values Tesla as a partner and appreciates what you do for our economy and our community,” Petersen wrote in her email memorializing the meeting, which was dated March 21st. “We are extremely grateful for your willingness to collaborate in our fight against the spread of COVID-19 by placing public health ahead of all other priorities.”

Later that day, though, Chia told the deputy city manager that he felt Petersen’s letter was “not fully accurate,” and the two sides had another virtual meeting on March 22nd. During that meeting, Tesla’s acting general counsel told the city that he believed the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued by Gov. Gavin Newsom superseded the county order, and that the language of the state order left room for Tesla to remain open. In another memo sent to Tesla on March 22nd, Petersen writes that she nonetheless felt “bound to uphold [the county health officer’s] interpretation” of the county-wide order.

Tesla ultimately decided to keep winding down its operations at the factory, save for basic operations like payroll. It also told the city that it would keep bringing in some factory workers to perform so-called “end-of-line” work, and the Fremont police department found Tesla to be “in compliance” during a post-shutdown inspection, as was first reported by The Verge last week.

The company has since gone on to scale back operations at the Gigafactory in Nevada by more than 75 percent, and has also shut down its solar panel factory in New York. Curiously, Petersen told Tesla in one of the emails that if the company “transition[ed] to manufacturing ventilators, or other equipment intended to aid in the fight against COVID-19,” it could have kept the factory open. Tesla is currently sourcing and delivering desperately needed ventilators in California and New York, along with surgical masks, and CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to manufacture ventilators with help from Medtronic. But Musk has said he plans to make the ventilators at Tesla’s New York factory, not in California.",real
1854,1448,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/19/new-political-battleground-over-coronavirus-math/,2020-05-19,The new political battleground over the coronavirus? Math.,"The graph became so ubiquitous that even President Trump at one point stood beside an iteration of it as his team advocated for broad social distancing efforts.

As the virus has continued to spread, experts and more casual observers have tracked daily numbers to evaluate the progress being made. Seeing a gap in data on daily testing, a group of volunteers established a project to compile individual state reports. Dashboards like the one created by researchers from Johns Hopkins University became go-to destinations for information about the virus’s spread. More sophisticated users tracked the reproduction number for the virus by state, a measure of its effective contagiousness. And when the Trump administration decided to encourage a scaling back of the containment measures, which had left a number of businesses closed, it established numeric benchmarks that states were supposed to meet before doing so.





When numbers and politics overlap, though, tension often emerges. If facts are stubborn things, numbers are nearly immobile — but not irreplaceable. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of occasions when the numbers related to the coronavirus pandemic have been misrepresented, altered or made a focus of efforts at reinterpretation as the inertia of political motivation has pushed against mathematical reality.

On Monday evening, Florida Today reported that the head of the Florida Department of Health’s data team claimed to have been forced from her position earlier this month. Rebekah Jones helped create a localized dashboard of coronavirus information used to track the spread of the virus in the state. A few weeks ago, though, control over the information was taken away from the department.

In a farewell note, Jones offered a word of caution about the data still being presented on the site.





“I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”

Once the White House gave the green light for states to scale back distancing measures at the end of April, Florida quickly moved forward with doing so. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a strong Trump ally, announced that the state would begin to reopen on May 4 — one day before Jones was removed from her position. The state did not reply to questions from Florida Today about the change in management of the data.

In Georgia, a different data-based kerfuffle emerged late last week. The state, which moved even more rapidly than Florida to scale back social distancing measures, has been a subject of scrutiny about whether it moved too quickly. So far, neither Georgia nor Florida has seen a significant increase in new infections — but things have not gone quite as well as one graph from the state’s Department of Public Health made it seem.





Political reporter Stephen Fowler noticed an anomaly in the graph showing a consistent downward trend in new cases in several large counties. That trend was a function of the data being shown out of order — May 1 was followed by April 30, which was followed by May 6, for example. The state claimed it had made a mistake, seeking to show data in a more readable way, without success. As Fowler noted, this wasn’t the primary graph detailing the spread of the virus on the site, bolstering the idea that it was simply a mistake, albeit a mistake that, at first glance, bolstered Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen Georgia.

As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, though, this was only one of a number of data mistakes or changes made by the state government. To some extent, this is a natural function of the fluid, shifting pandemic. It nonetheless raises questions about the validity of the numbers being used to evaluate Georgia’s progress and introduces the possibility of outside influence.

Trump and his allies are certainly aware of the focus on the numbers undergirding the pandemic. The president has consistently focused on the number of new cases of coronavirus and the death toll from covid-19, the disease it causes, as measures of his administration’s success. At times, he has been explicit about his efforts to keep the numbers from being inflated, as when he said at the beginning of March that he preferred to keep passengers on a ship anchored near San Francisco to prevent the number of cases in the United States from spiking.





Earlier this month, Axios reported on a different effort by the administration to tweak the numbers. Worried about a continually increasing death toll from the virus, Trump — echoing voices on Fox News and in the conservative media — argued that the totals were being overcounted. In reality, the death toll is almost certainly being significantly undercounted, but that is far less politically useful to a president seeking reelection in November.

Again, there is a natural uncertainty to a number of these metrics, offering cover to efforts to shape what they say. In Nebraska, counts of new infections at meatpacking plants were climbing quickly — until the state stopped reporting the numbers. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) argued that some of those who had been infected were misreporting their places of employment, making the numbers seem worse than they were. Public pressure eventually helped prompt the companies to release information about new infections.

Nationally, the data show that the number of new cases each day and the number of deaths from covid-19 have each declined. That’s obviously good news and bolsters the idea that the nation can cautiously begin relaxing some containment efforts. The question that arises, however, is whether states and the federal government will respond if those cases begin to rapidly increase again. Will there be a new push for social distancing rules?

Despite only boasting what could be describing as an average record in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the 26-year-old VanZant has become one of the faces of the female fight game.

Her profile has grown considerably in recent years owing to being featured on the US version of 'Dancing With The Stars', as well as stripping off for the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.

However, VanZant has apparently being increasingly of the opinion that her UFC pay-packet doesn't quite match her profile outside of the Octagon and appears keen to demonstrate her value to the organization ahead of an upcoming showdown with the 9-1 Brazilian Amanda Ribas.

It was reported by ESPN that VanZant will take on the surging Ribas on July 11. A location hasn't been officially confirmed, though a post on VanZant's Instagram stated that she will be ""coming to an island near you,"" in an apparent reference to Dana White's novel 'Fight Island' concept.

The UFC president has remained steadfastly tight-lipped as to the specifics of 'Fight Island', but it is thought that the idea will become a reality this summer and is designed as a method to have fighters based within the United States compete against athletes from outside the country as a means to bypass travel restrictions into the country amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Injury has kept VanZant out of the cage since a January 2019 win against Rachael Ostovich. She was scheduled to fight Ribas in March before being forced to withdraw with an arm injury, with the Brazilian fighting and defeating Rando Markos in VanZant's place.

The fight will represent that final bout on VanZant's UFC contract, after which she has suggested she will test the free agency market where it is likely she will receive interest from other MMA leagues. However, VanZant's growing reputation - coupled with an impressive performance against Ribas - could force the UFC's hand in handing her an improved deal.

""I want to prove my worth,"" VanZant said last month. ""You truly can’t find what your value is until you’re a free agent. When you’re locked into a contract, the only people that can set your value are the people that you’re signed with.""

""Change is very hard, but I’m looking for the best opportunity for my future and I don’t know what that is,"" she explained.

""I think it’s going to take negotiation with the UFC and negotiations with other organizations to know who’s going to offer me the brighter future. It might come down to other factors outside just a dollar figure. It’s really about who’s going to propel me to the best of their ability.""

VanZant garnered significant attention online in recent months by posting a series of semi-nude photographs alongside her husband, Bellator welterweight prospect Austin Vanderford - and has admitted that the money she receives from Instagram endorsements outstrips that of her UFC deal.

""If I were to stop everything I do outside of fighting and just fight, I would be at a loss. By a long shot,"" VanZant said in 2019.

And it seems likely that if Dana White is unwilling to cut the star an improved check, there is a realistic scenario where VanZant lines up alongside her husband as the latest UFC refugee to move to Bellator in pursuit of a sturdier salary.",fake

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images

Some of the most senior government officials assigned to the coronavirus crisis briefed House lawmakers Friday, and assured them that the Trump administration is not impeding their work or their communications with the public.

Representatives on both sides of the aisle have lauded some aspects of the outbreak response, while voicing frustration with others.

""I support the administration's declaration of a public health emergency,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., in her opening remarks to the briefing. ""That said, I have grave concerns about the lack of transparency and unwillingness to allow public health experts to speak freely about what is happening. ""

After reports Thursday that Vice President Mike Pence's office would be coordinating all government communications about the virus' spread, Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers at Friday's briefing that he would be backing out of a series of T.V. interviews this weekend.

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and is among the country's leading experts on contagious diseases. He told lawmakers that the decision had to do with the changing leadership around the coronavirus this week.

On Wednesday, Pence was tapped by Trump to spearhead the administration's response, and the vice president's office announced Thursday that it had named a separate coronavirus coordinator.

""Dr. Fauci said that when everything changed over to the Vice President being given the authority to lead the effort, Dr. Fauci had been already booked on a number of programs,"" said Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif. ""He said to everyone — I am not being muzzled, I want to clear that up.""

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is among the Trump administration's most vocal critics, said he believed Fauci.

""The President has made so many false statements on so many things you can't really rely on the White House, but thankfully we do have good career people at the agencies and we are going to rely on them to be candid with us,"" Schiff said. ""At the same time, I think [Fauci] should have been permitted to keep the commitments that he had made... He's among the most knowledgeable in the federal government.""

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday that there was ""no hard and fast process"" about requiring permission from the vice president's office before making public comment, but that the administration was trying to ""coordinate our messages.""

""No one's being stifled, no one's being told what to say,"" Kudlow told reporters inside the White House. ""You've got veterans in [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC with immense knowledge of these things, they've been through this before, and we're all ears.""

""We want to hear what they have to say,"" he said, adding, ""there's a big difference between stifling and coordinating.""

In an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Democratic members of Congress were only complaining about transparency regarding the coronavirus in an effort to ""bring down the president.""

He said the administration was holding sparsely attended hearings about the outbreak weeks ago, but Democrats only started caring once impeachment proceedings were over.

""Is [coronavirus] real? It is absolutely real,"" Mulvaney said, before also noting that the fatality rate of the virus is lower than other recent global outbreaks like Ebola and SARS.

Mulvaney also bemoaned how media organizations have covered the outbreak, saying he recommended one way to calm the financial markets that have been in freefall this week is by ""telling people to turn off their televisions for 24 hours.""

Testing concerns

After Friday's briefing, many members voiced frustration with the slow response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specifically related to testing for the coronavirus.

California representatives like Rep. John Garamendi, whose district includes one of the military bases where people who have been evacuated from China are being quarantined, says health officials say they have updated policies that made it difficult to test a wide range of people who presented symptoms associated with the COVID-19 virus.

""They had very strict protocols that said you cannot get tested unless you can show that you were coming from China and then exposed to those who were here that came from China,"" Garamendi told reporters after a briefing. ""That protocol prohibited testing. Ultimately, can they explain why they did it? Stupidity. That's my word, not theirs.""

Garamendi and others say they are also frustrated that there is a shortage of accurate tests available to health care workers in the U.S.

""They sat on their hands for two months,"" Garamendi said. ""Tests are readily available from Korea, now.""

Others, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, who was a practicing physician until his election in 2003, says he is concerned that the number of cases in the U.S. will inevitably grow and the number of tests available is insufficient.

""We have kind of moved from the days of containment to mitigation,"" Burgess said. ""My understanding is that two weeks ago there was a test that was being distributed and then there was a question about the efficacy.""

Indeed, a problem with one ingredient in test kits that the CDC distributed to labs around the country created a frustrating bottleneck in testing, requiring most testing to occur at the CDC in Atlanta, as NPR's Rob Stein has reported. The CDC announced Thursday that it had resolved the issue.

Congress is in agreement that emergency funding is needed to address the outbreak, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and more than a dozen people in the U.S., but House and Senate leaders are still haggling over the exact figures.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that his chamber will consider a supplemental funding plan for the coronavirus within the next two weeks, and Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress was ""coming close to a bipartisan agreement.""

The number two Senate Democratic leader, Sen. Dick Durbin, tweeted Friday that Pence reached out to him about working together.

And on Friday, lawmakers still tried to project a sense of calm about the virus.

""People shouldn't panic,"" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y. ""The risk right now in the United States is very low.""",real

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed zero new cases of the virus on Saturday – a first since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported only two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

Good News! Chinese mainland reports ZERO daily new #COVID19 case! 2 suspected cases reported – 1 imported case in Shanghai and 1 domestic in NE#China's Jilin. pic.twitter.com/6SElh7UxUX — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) May 23, 2020

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

Press TV, Tehran

For the first time in their history, International Quds Day events have gone online as a result of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.

But according to organizers of Quds Day rallies, the forced cancellation of the annual events in Iran does not mean that Iranians have forgotten Palestinians at this important period of time.

To mark the occasion this year, applications have been made to stream messages from a wide array of community leaders, activists and public figures. In this campaign, all truth-seekers in Iran have been asked to choose an anti-Israel slogan, and then join an online rally on social media to show their support for Palestine.

International Quds Day is an annual event during which demonstrators express their solidarity with the Palestinian people and their opposition to the occupation of Palestinian territories by the Zionist regime of Israel.

The day is seen as the legacy of the late founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran Imam Khomeini who officially declared the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan as International Quds Day back in 1979.

Although this year’s Quds Day rallies have been called off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the support for Palestinian cause remains high. This shows that despite all difficulties Palestine will remain the first issue of the Islamic world forever.",fake

The report, based on a study of COVID-19 exposure by six different age groups, found that almost in every age category, Latinos, African Americans and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have higher case rates for COVID-19 than whites. This is an indicator that these racial populations are experiencing varying degrees of greater exposure to the virus than whites, said David E. Hayes-Bautista, professor of medicine and the center’s director.

For example, in the 0-17 age group, Latinos have the highest number of cases, with 31.8 per 100,000 people compared to 8.6 cases among whites. In the 18-34 age group, Pacific Islanders have nearly 300 cases per 100,000 compared to 72.9 among whites. The number of coronavirus cases gets higher among Latinos, African Americans and Pacific Islanders as the age of the individuals increases.

Latinos, in particular, are vulnerable because they serve in a lot of jobs at essential businesses, Hayes-Bautista said.

“They are the farm workers who grow and pick food, meat packers, truck drivers, grocery stockers, checkout clerks, auto mechanics, bus drivers and attendants in nursing homes,” he said. “They have a high rate of exposure. But they were also the last ones to get personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. So it’s not surprising at all that they have higher case rates.”

Latinos and Asians also tend to “live more densely,” and often multiple generations share the same home, Hayes-Bautista said.

“The cost of housing in California is horrendously high and wages for these essential workers are not very high,” he said. “So you have senior citizens, younger wage earners and children living together. When the wage earners or essential workers go to work and come back home, they are likely infecting the others in the home.”

New statistics released by the APM Research Lab on Wednesday, May 20, titled “The Color of Coronavirus,” showed that, nationwide, African Americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people compared with 20.7 for whites, 22.9 for Latinos and 22.7 for Asian Americans. Nationwide, more than 20,000 African Americans have died from the coronavirus.

Minority populations also suffer as a result of not being able to afford health insurance or obtain it because they are undocumented. Luz Gallegos, community programs director at the TODEC Legal Center, a Perris-based immigrant assistance group, said Latino immigrants, in particular, have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic because of the Trump administration’s public charge rule that could deny green cards to immigrants who use social services such as food stamps, cash assistance or public housing, she said.

“People don’t want to get tested or be on the radar as having tested positive,” she said. “So they are spreading the virus within their families or within local communities.”

To understand why, we broke down census, labor, and healthcare data between the two New York City boroughs.

We found that COVID-19 is not the great equalizer.

While Manhattan, on average, has higher incomes and better access to healthcare, the Bronx is up against generations of food deserts, income inequality, crumbling public housing, and poor clinical care. Plus, more frontline workers and subway riders are coming from the Bronx right now.

With 50% more Latino and black residents in the Bronx than Manhattan, you begin to see why being a person of color living in the Bronx makes COVID-19 two times deadlier.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Following is a transcript of the video.



Narrator: Why is COVID-19 hitting some communities harder than others? And who exactly has been hit hardest? We're seeing this happen across the country. But to better understand the divide, we zeroed in on two New York City boroughs: The Bronx and Manhattan.

Even though Manhattan has more people, The Bronx has more cases and more deaths. We wanted to understand the reasons for this gap, so we compared the boroughs based on three criteria: why more people are getting infected, being hospitalized, and dying from COVID-19. And it's revealed this pandemic is attacking two very different Americas. Let's look at why there's a difference in infection numbers between the two boroughs. We'll start with income.

The Bronx is the poorest borough in the city, with a median income of $38,000, compared to Manhattan's $82,000. Almost 60% of people in the Bronx are paying more than they can afford for housing, which has led to more multigenerational housing in the Bronx and more residents in public housing than any other borough. For every apartment in the Bronx, there are 2.8 people living in it. Compare that to the two people living in every apartment in Manhattan. More people at home likely means more people get sick.

Overall, there's 350,000 more housing units in Manhattan than the Bronx, and better-quality housing. See this map? Most residents in the Bronx are dealing with maintenance problems, like leaks, rats, cracks, plumbing, and broken toilets. These issues alone make it more challenging to live at home, not to mention having to work from home because of COVID-19. That is, if you can work from home.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, of those Americans making less than $33,000 a year, which are these neighborhoods in the Bronx, 9% of people could work from home. Whereas of those people making more than $79,000 a year, all of these neighborhoods in Manhattan, 60% could work from home. On the other hand, in the Bronx, residents who can't work from home are most likely out of a job and tight on money, or they're essential workers.

Think grocery-store clerks, transit employees, trash collectors, healthcare workers, many of those people you see daily out on the front lines. 17% of frontline workers in New York City are coming from the Bronx, while just 12% are from Manhattan. And for the majority of these essential workers, getting to their job means taking the subway. Subway ridership has dropped across the city, but not by the same amount. In Manhattan, 75% fewer people are riding, but in the Bronx, ridership has dropped only 55%. So trains to and from the Bronx can be packed, especially with reduced subway services. Plus, people from the Bronx face longer commutes than people in Manhattan. On average, 12.7 minutes longer of standing body to body with that person who's maybe coughing.

OK, let's move on to the second criterion. Let's say someone in each borough does get the virus. What will influence whether they become hospitalized? The Bronx has had over 10,000 hospitalizations. Manhattan? About 6,000. Every year, New York counties are ranked based on their health. Last year, Manhattan was sixth best in the state. The Bronx? Dead last, out of 62 counties. This is based on things like access to clinical care, the environment, and preexisting conditions.

The Bronx has higher rates of preexisting conditions like asthma, heart disease, and obesity, conditions that increase the risk of a severe COVID-19 case. To explain why this is, we're gonna have to go deep. We'll start with obesity rates between the two boroughs. Studies have shown that poor diets and lack of exercise are linked to obesity. And in the Bronx, families facing money problems or limited time are forced to turn to cheaper, prepackaged foods. 87% of kids in the Bronx rely on free or reduced school lunches, which are packed with salt and fat. Plus, the Bronx has almost double the amount of food stamps per individual compared to Manhattan.

But the greatest contributor to diet, though, is access. And the Bronx has historically had some of the worst food deserts in the country, where it's hard to find affordable and healthy food close to home. All of these factors have created a lack of healthy resources for generations in the Bronx. They lead to unhealthy eating habits and high rates of obesity and diabetes, both preexisting conditions that increase your risk of death from COVID-19. On the other hand, in Manhattan, life expectancy and access to healthy food is much higher. People not only have more access to grocery stores, they also have more gyms to choose from. Simply put, these things and disposable income make it a lot easier to be healthier here.

Another preexisting condition that skyrockets risk of COVID-19 hospitalization: asthma. In big cities, studies have shown pollution is a major cause of asthma. Pollution is bad across New York City, but the Bronx has the highest rates of asthma-related emergency-room visits. There's even a place nicknamed Asthma Alley in the South Bronx. It's surrounded by four highways and sanitation and sewage facilities. There's also a bunch of trucks coming and going from all of these distribution centers, these food wholesalers, and the FreshDirect distribution center here and the Wall Street Journal and New York Post printing press here. At last count, asthma hospitalizations were 27 times higher in this area than the rest of the city. Bad asthma equals a higher risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19 and needing a ventilator to help you breathe. But it gets worse when you take into account how accessible medical professionals are in these areas.

In Manhattan, there's one physician for every 750 people. In the Bronx, there's one physician for every 1,770 people. There are also fewer hospital beds in the Bronx. Manhattan has almost double the amount of hospitals for only a 15% larger population. That brings us to our third and final criterion. Why are more people dying due to COVID-19 in the Bronx? In Manhattan, four emergency hospitals were constructed to combat coronavirus. While the Bronx was promised one, the borough hasn't gotten it yet. Quality care also isn't as accessible in the Bronx. On average, Manhattan hospitals received three out of five stars. Bronx hospitals received 1.2 out of five stars. Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx is one of the five worst-rated hospitals in the nation.

Add in the effect of preexisting conditions we talked about earlier, and the Bronx has had 2,800 deaths of people with underlying conditions. Manhattan? Almost 1,300. Altogether, as of May 10, Manhattan's death toll was 1,946, while the Bronx hit 3,177 deaths. And when you break down New York City's death toll, people of color are two times more likely to die of coronavirus. In the Bronx, the population is 85% black or Hispanic. Whereas in Manhattan, 64% of the population is white. This is why you're seeing headlines that a disproportionate number of people of color are dying of COVID-19. But these deaths go beyond coronavirus.

For the Bronx, cycles of income inequality, food deserts, poor healthcare, fewer hospitals, and crumbling housing have harmed communities of color for generations. And we see this pattern repeat itself again and again with black and brown communities across the country. Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles. This disease is not the great equalizer. Yes, anyone can get COVID-19. But not everyone is as vulnerable to dying from it. That has everything to do with the problems in place long before this ever started.",real

The Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2. The company said comparable sales, which included online purchases, increased 10.8% for the quarter.

""Throughout the first quarter, our team and guests faced unprecedented challenges arising from the spread of COVID-19,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said in a news release. ""In the face of those challenges, our team showed extraordinary resilience as guests relied on Target as a trusted resource for their families.""

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Weary of more than two months of lockdowns, lost jobs, vanished income, and emotional distress, Americans are practicing a bit of Irish Democracy, shopping, dining out, gathering, and trying to carry on as before the pandemic arrived without approval from authorities. It was bound to happen.

As has been widely noted, we were initially told that we needed to shut down and shelter in place so that we would “flatten the curve” of infection growth to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed by people sick with COVID-19. That benchmark was met a little more than a month into the lockdowns. Time magazine reported in late April that “The U.S. Has Flattened the Curve.” This New York Times chart clearly shows that the flattening began early last month.

Yet many Americans are still under shelter-in-place orders, some of which have been extended. We hate to use a cliche, but politicians have been moving the goalposts. Flattening the curve isn’t good enough. They want to keep people home until there’s a vaccine; or science, which has sadly become a loose term that means whatever the user wants it to, has established an effective treatment; or maybe until there are zero coronavirus cases.

This has rankled more than a few. The masses are fed up with huddling in their homes and are yearning to breathe free.

The center of the “resistance” might be, oddly enough, in California, which has three “Free Counties.” Sutter and Yuba, just north of Sacramento, and Modoc, in the state’s far northeast corner, have reopened without Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approval. More counties quickly followed, rushing, reports the Sacramento Bee, “to persuade state health officials they are ready to reopen key segments of their local economies on a fast-track basis.”

In Southern California, Orange County engaged Newsom in a bitter battle over reopening beaches there. Newsom closed the shoreline when he saw photos that he didn’t like of people on the sand in Newport Beach. County Supervisor Michelle Steel called it an “act of retribution against Orange County.” But beachgoers eventually won by kicking up such a fuss that Newsom and state authorities were pressured into making a decision they otherwise would not have made.

Meanwhile, Michiganders are chafing under the boot of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has issued arguably the harshest lockdown orders in the country, and has even extended to May 28 her initial closure order for some businesses. The capital in Lansing has been the site of demonstrations by some deeply restless, and in many cases angry, protesters.

“We haven’t had any bloodshed yet,” one member of a Facebook group called Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine recently wrote.

We hope there is none. But tempers are short. One man has already been charged with making death threats against Whitmer and the state attorney general. And we’ve seen members of the Michigan Militia swear they aren’t going to allow law enforcement to arrest an Owosso barber who reopened his business because he had no other income. How long can she hold back demands for freedom — in America?

Other developments include:

Palm Beach County, Florida, reopened before it had met federal guidelines, according to a weekend story in the Florida Sun-Sentinel.

“Lockdown-weary New Yorkers ditched the distancing to get social instead this weekend — transforming parts of the Big Apple into a raucous, late-season Mardi Gras,” the New York Post reported last week.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has struck down Gov. Tony Evers’ orders, immediately lifting “all restrictions on businesses and gatherings imposed by the administration’s order” while keeping “in place the closure of schools until fall.” The suit was filed by the Republican leadership in the Wisconsin Legislature.

A group has filed a lawsuit against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the attorney general for using the “pandemic as an excuse to revoke a long list of natural rights” guaranteed by the Constitution, and “recognized in the Declaration of Independence.”

Stephen Kruiser, who writes PJMedia’s Morning Briefing, suggested Monday that the lockdown governors need to be locked up. “The ‘never let a crisis go to waste’ crowd continues to overplay its hand, which is why this would be the perfect time to begin some real push-back against them,” he writes. They “need to be reined in for the financial well-being of the people whose lives they’re ruining.”

Law enforcement officers showed up Monday at a New Jersey gym that opened without permission. One of the officers read a notice informing the members they were in violation of the governor’s orders. He then said “on that note, have a good day. Everybody be safe,” before turning and walking away.

A few days after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said that counties and businesses that plan to reopen without state approval were committing a “cowardly act,” protesters rallied on the capitol steps in Harrisburg, chanting “open us up” and “let us work.”

Other protests have been seen on Long Island, and in Sacramento; Annapolis; Washington, D.C.; North Carolina, Rhode Island, Ohio, Minnesota, and Livermore, California.

The control that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who are advising them have been exerting is clearly slipping away, and they are facing a choice: They can work with the people who feel suffocated and expeditiously restore as much normalcy as possible, or they can remain on their present course, which increases the chances there’ll be violence because either a protester or someone in a security line will make a poor decision of out anger or fear, and then pay the price on Election Day.

As Adm. Josh Painter said in “The Hunt For Red October,” “this business will get out of control. It will get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.” There is that much raw emotion out there.

Opinion contributor

The coronavirus projections coming from experts have two major components: How mobile we are (that is, are we leaving home) and how well we “socially distance” to six feet or more unless we are wearing a mask. The other parts of the models are important, but all are easier to predict on the basis of what happened in each locality when 100% of the country was supposed to be on “lockdown.”

This isn’t that complicated. Since the projections are based to a real extent on mobility and distancing, by definition the projections will change as we open up the economy and how we do it. We will be heading right back toward the same deadly peaks unless we socially distance — because social distancing is how we got the curves to go down in the first place.

Wear a donut or use a hockey stick

►This 6-foot separation is not a joke and people are just plain irresponsible if they don’t pay attention to it. A man in Italy has created a 6-foot donut to wear; Canadians use hockey sticks. In Germany, a restaurant gave patrons hats with pool noodles on them to remind them to distance. We need an easy foldable device; patent it and make millions.

“It won't happen to me!” That’s not the issue. Everyone gets counted in the projections – including the people on the beach. We are already seeing it. The latest projections are 147,000 U.S. deaths by August. This is more than double the projections just a month ago. What happened? Better modeling? No. Massive uprising against social distancing? Yes. If we don’t social distance, and soon, numbers will reach the tipping point and locality by locality, we will all be forced to stay home — just like last time. No one wants that!

►That 6-foot distance has been determined scientifically, but I am concerned with the effectiveness of the masks we are wearing at distances less than six feet. If they don’t work then this is the worst case of more certain transmission. We should only be able to buy masks that prevent transmission to, say two feet, when worn correctly. Each mask should have instructions enclosed for how to wear it. I have an N95 mask, and it is difficult to breathe. Hopefully other masks can be effective for those who are not first responders.

When do negative tests expire?

►Testing for presence of the virus. As we increase testing (and hopefully make it more accurate), we of course need to understand that just the math will decrease the number of cases per million people. A nationally-comparable statistic must be developed and continually published that accounts for increased testing or we will develop a false sense of security “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing. Publishing each state’s number of tests per million people and number of positives per million people will help to avoid the false sense of security by “blaming” the increase in positives on increased testing.

Coronavirus pause: People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon

There is an important issue raised by people in the White House not wearing masks and turning positive. All had been tested negative – until they weren’t. So we must ask the question, “How long is a negative test good for?” Maybe three days or five days? At least food in the grocery store has an expiration date. No one has told us the expiration date for a negative test.

Nobody is no-risk in Russian Roulette

Everyone who is tested once as negative has to be re-tested very frequently. Same for the contact tracing. Have we dialed those numbers into our testing procedures? If we don’t test this frequently, then we are kidding ourselves that testing means anything: you are negative until you are exposed to the next positive person who may be asymptomatic.

Does everyone need to be tested for the virus, or for antibodies? Some have said no. But if not, then how do we deal with the five presumably low risk people who contracted the virus recently at a birthday party where no one was social distancing or wearing a mask? Seems like a game of Russian Roulette; you can't predict who gets the bullet.

Reaching teens:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Pay close attention to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York, which has returned to where it was March 19 in deaths and hospitalizations. New York is re-opening extremely carefully. If the hospitalizations and deaths in New York, start back up, I believe we will see that for the rest of the country.

From what we know today, until there is a vaccine that is available and works for all, we are stuck with this virus and must socially distance and wear masks. Every one of us can do that right now. If we don’t, it won't be their problem, it will be your personal problem when we are all shut back in. Right around election time.

In an interview with the Chinese news network CGTN on Saturday, Wuhan Institute of Virology Director Wang Yanyi once again rejected the Trump administration's claims that the coronavirus came from the institute's lab.

""This is pure fabrication. Our institute first received the clinical sample of the unknown pneumonia on 30 December last year"", she said, adding that after institute experts ""checked the pathogen within the sample, we found it contained a new coronavirus, which is now called SARS-CoV-2"".

""We didn't have any knowledge before that, nor had we ever encountered, researched, or kept the virus. In fact, like everyone else, we didn't even know the virus existed. How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?"", Wang pointed out.

She also recalled the ""current consensus of the international academic community"" on COVID-19 which suggests that ""the virus originated from wild animals"", but added ""we still don't clearly know what kind of viruses that all different wild species carry across the globe and where the viruses that are highly similar to SARS-CoV-2 are"".

""This is why cooperation between scientists all over the world is needed to find the answers. Therefore, the issue of origin-tracking is ultimately a question of science, which requires scientists to make judgments based on scientific data and facts"", Wang underscored.

Beijing Rejects Washington's Virus Origin Claims

Her remarks come as Washington continues to assert that COVID-19 came from a Wuhan biolab, with President Donald Trump claiming earlier in May that ""probably it was incompetence"" and that ""somebody was stupid"", in an apparent reference to Wuhan Institute of Virology staff.

He was echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who blamed China for covering up the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and pointed to alleged ""enormous evidence"" that the coronavirus originated in a Wuhan biolab.

The allegations have consistently been rejected by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which called on the US to ""handle its domestic affairs properly first"", rather than shift blame and the focus onto China.

The Ministry also pointed out that World Health Organisation officials have ""repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab"".

""Now [US officials] are again hyping up the issue of origins, insinuating that the virus had something to do with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It's not difficult to see through their tricks which intend to muddy the waters, deflect attention, and shift the blame to others"", Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last month.

Also in April, Yuan Zhiming, vice director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, told CGTN ""there is no way"" that the coronavirus was man-made, adding, ""we have a strict regulatory regime and code of conduct of research, so we are confident"".

""It's bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people. […] The Washington Post and several other reporters wrote about the virus coming from the Wuhan lab. They have no evidence, or knowledge, this is entirely based on speculation"", Yuan stressed.",fake

Enlarge this image toggle caption HarperVia HarperVia

In her now-world-famous writing, Chinese author Fang Fang implores: ""The departed are gone, but the living must go on. As before. I just hope we can remember.""

The writer's detailed account of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, originally published in Chinese as a daily diary as the virus rapidly spread there, becomes available in English on Friday as Wuhan Diary: Dispatches from a Quarantined City. Bits and clips of Fang Fang's writing on the situation in Wuhan made it out of China and into English as the outbreak was unfolding, but now the full account will be available in English.

Memory is central to Fang Fang's diary. So is making sense of the complete absence of things: of life as we knew it; of any and all economic activity. Like tens of millions of other readers, I read Fang Fang in the monotony of self-isolation, looking for a common understanding of how the pandemic had changed the country we were living in — China.

Before the novel coronavirus engulfed the Chinese city of Wuhan, Fang Fang was already an award-winning novelist of realist fiction. But her chronicle of the lockdown of her hometown Wuhan might be her most lasting work.

Fang Fang penned her first entry on January 25, two days after the city was suddenly sealed off from the rest of China, to let friends and anyone curious understand ""what is really going on here on the ground in Wuhan."" Over the next 59 entries spanning more than two months, her writing veers from a collection of the quotidian aspects of life under lockdown to her mounting frustration with local officials — no small gesture of bravery in China.

Out of necessity, her diary supersedes any kind of traditional literary work, in both content and form.

By early February, China's Internet censors were working overtime, during the height of the epidemic, to erase critical content. Fang Fang's diary thus often serves as an archive, describing videos and news items usually deleted by the time she managed to publish her daily entry. As her online diary begins to attract millions of readers, she begins incorporating information gleaned from text messages and phone calls from well-connected friends in the arts and medical fields, forming a kind of written collage of Wuhan.

Eventually, the censors came for Fang Fang. Loyal readers took screenshots of her entries before they were deleted, or helped repost entires on various other social media channels.

Unfortunately, the English translation of her diary in book form is not able to capture this multidimensionality. Wuhan Diary loses much of its engaging, real-time nature by condensing her 60 entries into a single tome. Nonetheless, it is a heroic feat of speedy translation from veteran Michael Berry.

""You have that whole connecting universe extending from her diary entries...of course, reading it now, after the fact, is a very different experience,"" Berry, who is also translating Fang Fang's last novel, Soft Burial, told NPR. Still, readers in the U.S. will likely find many of her gripes about local officials and the burden of social distancing all too relevant.

Fang Fang's Wuhan diary remains significant as a document of the trivial, tragic and absurd during Wuhan's 76 days of lockdown. Such a document is especially important now, when so much of how the coronavirus spread — and what governments across the world did or did not do to contain it — is already being contested by the U.S. and China.

""Imagine this: the author Fang Fang did not exist in today's Wuhan...What would we have heard? What would we have seen?"" asked writer Yan Lianke in a widely-shared online talk in late February. Memory, Yan goes on to say, is the most basic hedge against future injustice: ""While memories may not give us the power to change reality, it can at least raise a question in our hearts when a lie comes our way.""

Fang Fang's diary, then, is an important record how Wuhan's people suffered and ultimately persevered, even as the state wants to erase its initial fumbles from the official record.

Raising questions does not make one popular in China these days. Nearly immediately after she began publishing her entries, an online army of ultra-nationalists deluged Fang Fang, indignant that in airing doubts about the superiority of China's coronavirus containment she was betraying her motherland. That her diary could be published in English only months after the Wuhan lockdown was lifted, they hinted darkly, meant Fang Fang was deliberately aiding Western countries to smear China and to profit off the suffering of Wuhan. Berry says even he has received thousands of angry emails and death threats for simply translating her writing.

One anonymous letter, allegedly written by a high school student, lambasted Fang Fang for airing China's dirty laundry out for everyone to see. ""My child, I also want to tell you that when I was 16 years old, I was much worse off than you are. At that time, I had never even heard of words like 'independent thought,'"" Fang Fang gently wrote back.

China today is more globalized and more confident than ever. It has also become more hostile to foreign ideas, suspicious they are Western designs to stop China's rise, and has demonstrated its willingness to engage in bare-knuckles diplomacy.

Voices like Fang Fang's — who remember well the brutal decade of the Cultural Revolution, when adolescent Maoists tortured, persecuted and beat to death the politically incorrect, as well as the subsequent prosperity of economic reform and opening— are increasingly rare in China. But in the context of larger conversations being had about China and its place in the world, American readers would do well to remember they exist.

1900,1713,http://sputniknews.com/india/202005221079387293-covid-19-recession-in-india-is-given-question-is-how-deep-the-crisis-is-analysts-say/,2020-05-22,"COVID-19: Recession in India is Given, Question is How Deep the Crisis is, Analysts Say","New Delhi (Sputnik): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week announced a $266 billion economic stimulus package in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actual fiscal stimulus in the package is about $24 billion, which is less than one percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - equivalent to India's total goods and services.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown has brought the economic activity to a complete standstill for about two months now. Even as lockdown relaxations have been eased by the Indian Home Ministry, the country's apex bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday hinted at negative Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the current financial year, which ends next March.

This represents the first recognition by any Indian government entity of the fact that the country is staring at an economic recession, which is technically two consecutive quarters of negative growth.

Without providing any guidance or range in which the Indian growth will contract in the current financial year due to the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in negative territory, with some pick-up in growth impulses from the second half (October 2020 – March 2021) onwards. Much will depend on how quickly the COVID curve flattens and begins to moderate”.

Experts, however, believe that the fact that there is going to be a recession due to the pandemic is a given. The question is how deep is it going to be?

Indian Prime Minister Modi, in a televised address on 24 March, announced a national lockdown at a four hours’ notice. The economy has remained shut ever since then with some relaxations like allowing factories and industrial units to open up with limited staff.

The Indian railway ministry has also started limited passenger services and the ministry of civil aviation has allowed limited flights to begin operating from 25 May.

Even though the macroeconomic data for April, the first month of the financial year, hasn’t been published yet, the Indian government’s March data on some macro indicators reveals that the crisis is deep.

A week’s lockdown in March completely wiped out the industrial output for month contracting 16.7 percent. This compares with growth of 4.62 percent in the preceding month of February and 2.08 percent in January.

If that is an indication of the severe impact of a seven-day lockdown, Professsor N.R. Bhanumurthy from the National Institute Public Finance and Policy gives us a sneak peek into the depth of recessionary crisis that lies ahead for the Indian economy

“The current quarter (April-June) and the next two quarters are likely to see negative growth according to studies done by us based on financial modelling. All will depend heavily on the manner in which the macro-economic policies and announcements are implemented. Even with the measures taken through the economic stimulus announced recently, growth will come back only in the fourth quarter of the current financial year (Jan-March 2021),” Bhanumurthy told Sputnik.

Referring to the Modi’s $266 billion economic stimulus package announced on 12 May, Bhanumurthy said even if the benefits of the package are taken into account, the Indian GDP growth will remain zero in the current financial year due to the impact of the package. And, had the Indian government not announced the stimulus, the GDP growth in the financial year 2020-21 would have contracted by at least 12.5 percent.

That said, he also points towards deep recession claiming that even with the stimulus package in place, there is hardly going to be any relief until December.

“We are expecting a 26 percent contraction in growth in the ongoing quarter (April-June) in comparison to the same period last year. And a de-growth of 12.5 per cent each is likely to take place in the both July-September and October-December quarter. However, these assessments may change if government announces further measures in between,” said Bhanumurthy.

It is not that the Indian economy was doing great either before the lockdown. Beginning early 2018 the Indian economy had been slowing down with GDP falling almost every consecutive quarter due to the combined impact its financial sector crisis as well as the US-China trade war. From over 8 percent growth in early 2018, the Indian GDP collapsed by almost half to 4.7 in October – December 2019.

“We expect the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak to weigh on already fragile household consumption which, coupled with sluggish business activity, will result in a sharp decline in India's economic growth in fiscal 2020-21,” said Deborah Tan, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.

“Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the economy had already been growing at its slowest pace in six years. Adding the impact from the outbreak, Moody's now expects India's real GDP to contract in the fiscal year ending March 2021 (fiscal 2020-21) compared with an earlier projection of zero growth,” Tan added.

The stimulus announced by Prime Minister Modi weighs heavily on sovereign backed funding arrangements for businesses from banks and financial institutions rather than acting as a direct fiscal stimulus.

A key lawmaker from India’s principal opposition party Congress, P. Chidambaram, a former finance minister, has criticised Modi’s stimulus plan saying that government opted for liquidity measures to boost supply at a time when fiscal measures should have been taken to boost demand to revitalise the economy.

Challenges, however, remain for the economy. And RBI Governor Das’s statement sums those up.

“Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the 2 months lockdown. The top 6 industrialised states that account for about 60 percent of industrial output are largely in red or orange zones. High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning in March 2020 across both urban and rural segments.

The $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package marks the largest rescue package in American history. President Trump announced Wednesday that it includes $300 billion in direct payments to individuals to alleviate at least a little of the financial pain caused by the deliberate near-standstill of the U.S. economy.

But despite promises that the one-time funds will be distributed ""within the next three weeks,"" it will likely be months before the stimulus checks hit bank accounts according to experts.

Under the plan, single people earning incomes below $75,000 will receive as much as $1,200 as ""direct payments into most people's deposit accounts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a news briefing on Wednesday.

Married couples would get $2,400, and parents would receive $500 for each child under age 17. About 90% of households — approximately 165 million — would benefit from the checks, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Payments would be phased out beyond those income limits, and people making more than $99,000 will not be eligible at all.

How soon can I expect my check?

""It really depends on what information the IRS has on you,"" Kyle Pomerleau, a resident fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told NPR.

That's because the infusion of cash will be distributed by the IRS, so those who have previously received tax refunds via direct deposit will be first in line for the rebate checks. Pomerleau, estimates the earliest those payments will go out is three to four weeks after the package is approved.

Alternatively, people who receive tax refunds through the mail will have to hold out much longer.

""I don't think physical checks will be in the mail for another three to four months,"" Pomerleau said, citing delays in the system in 2008 when the government last issued national stimulus payments under the George W. Bush administration.

Back then the financial relief package was signed into law in February but the delivery date for people whose checks were sent through the mail was somewhere between May and July.

There's another group who may have an even longer wait: Those who receive tax refunds in the mail and have moved since filing 2018 taxes.

""So far there's no information on how [the IRS is] going to handle that,"" he said.

What if I didn't file 2018 taxes?

Pomerleau says nonfilers, including recent college graduates, and those who didn't file 2018 taxes because they had no obligation, ""would be left out unless they hurry up and file a return for 2019.""

Americans receiving Social Security benefits are also on file with the government and their payments will be based on those records, he added.

What if I made more than $99,000 in 2018 or 2019?

Those who earned more than $99,000 are not totally shut out from the massive relief package if they expect to make less than that sum in the coming year.

The IRS will allow tax filers to qualify for the relief aid next year, when filing 2020 taxes.

""That of course is no good for someone who needs to pay their bills today,"" Pomerleau said, ""but all is not lost.""

Other holdups

Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, suspects the IRS's infrastructure, or lack thereof, will create even more delays for desperate people.

In the past it has taken several months for the government to develop, test and install the kind of software necessary to launch a rebate program. But it is unclear, what if anything, the administration has done behind the scenes so far.

""It takes several months to get a program like this up and moving,"" Holtzblatt told NPR.

""I hope that they've been building their infrastructure in the days between when they first announced they were going to do this and the day of enactment,"" she said, adding that in 2008, the process took at least three months.

Impact of COVID-19 on the IRS

Another unknown factor, that Holtzblatt says needs to be considered is how the COVID-19 disease is going to affect the capacity of the IRS staff to ensure the timely delivery of the payments.

As she noted in a recent blog post:

All of that may slow distribution of the payments, Holtzblatt said.

She cautioned the public to be patient: ""The IRS will be overburdened and there will be lots of taxpayer confusion ... and all this will collide with the processing of 2019 returns. There will be snafus.""",real

Although sources close to the Palestinian leader told Israel Hayom newspaper that the intentions of the leader to end all cooperation with Israel and the US were ""serious"", they also stated that his assertion was mostly declarative and George Jaqman, Director of the Ramallah-based Institute for Democratic Studies, believes it is unlikely that Mahmoud Abbas will go ahead with the move.

Abbas Cries Wolf Again

""He can say whatever he wants in the media but the truth is that we simply don't know whether Abbas has a strategic plan to implement his declaration. We will only believe it if we see its practical implementation on the ground,"" Jagman explained.

However, that might prove a difficult task. Since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in 1993, Ramallah has cooperated with Tel Aviv on various levels, including that of security, helping the Jewish state thwart major terrorist attacks.

Last November, for example, the PA allegedly handed Tel Aviv ""crucial information"" that led to the tracking and subsequent elimination of a top Islamic Jihad commander, Baha Abu Al Atta.

But the security cooperation has also helped the PA. In recent years, Hamas, which has been competing with Abbas' Fatah, has stepped up its efforts to challenge the Palestinian leadership, planning attacks on their security personnel.

According to reports, the Palestinian leader's life has also been in danger ""at least twice"" with Israel's inner spy agency the Shin Bet helping Ramallah to foil his assassination and keep the militants of Hamas and other extremist groups in check.

That's why, believes the expert, Abbas' declaration -- that has been used on a multiple occasions in the past but has never materialised -- is merely aimed at giving ""a green light"" to the Palestinians, urging them to take to the streets and clash with Israelis, hoping that the escalation of tensions would force Israel to back down from its plans to incorporate more West Bank territory.

Back to Armed Struggle?

According to a recent poll conducted by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, 94 percent of Palestinians expressed their strong rejection of the peace plan rolled by US President Donald Trump in January, that presupposed major land swaps and the extension of Israel's sovereignty over predominantly Palestinian areas.

The same survey found that 77 percent of respondents were supportive of the idea of ending the PA's security cooperation with Israel, whereas 64 percent said they were in favour of resorting to an armed struggle to force Tel Aviv to scrap its expansion plans.

For Jaqman, however, attempts to drive the Palestinians out to the streets are ""not realistic"" simply because the reality on the ground has changed, he believes.

""In the past, Palestinians were able to clash with Israeli soldiers face to face because Israel's security personnel was positioned inside Palestinian towns, whereas now they opt to stay on the outskirts of cities which makes it more difficult for the Palestinians to reach and confront them.""

To minimise losses, Israel has also erected a fence separating its territories from the Palestinians. The 708 kilometre-long barrier -- constructed in the wake of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) -- has managed to significantly decrease the number of Palestinian infiltrations, putting an end to a wave of terror attacks that engulfed the country in the early 2000s.

However, the implementation of security measures is far from the only factor that keeps Palestinians at home, says the pundit. In March, when the first coronavirus cases started popping up, the PA implemented a series of strict measures including a full lockdown of towns and cities to contain the spread of the pandemic, thus bringing the interaction between the Palestinian crowds and Israeli security forces to a minimum.

""Add this to the fact that the economic situation in the West Bank has deteriorated and you will understand why people will choose to refrain from an armed struggle despite polls that show overwhelming support for these tactics,"" explained Jaqman.

""The key for solving the problem and preventing Israel from going ahead with its plans lies within the Palestinian leadership, not the masses. It is only them who can stop Tel Aviv's intentions,"" he added.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to hold a vote on the bill extending sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, that makes up some 30 percent of the predominantly Palestinian West Bank, in early July.

The bill will need to pass three readings before it becomes a law. If it does, the practical meaning of that would be that Israel will not only absorb some 65 thousand Palestinians who live in the area but will also gain full control over an agriculturally important piece of land which is considered pivotal for the economy of an independent Palestinian state.

Sovereignty over this area will also mean that Israel now needs to go through a long and bureaucratic procedure to approve construction and will be able to shorten these processes, enabling a relatively quick Jewish expansion.

US industrial production slid in April by the most since data collection began in 1919 as coronavirus lockdowns slammed manufacturing activity.

Manufacturing output plunged a record 13.7% ""as all major industries posted decreases,"" the Federal Reserve said in a Friday release. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 14.6% drop.

Total production dipped 11.2% after its 4.5% contraction in March. Automobile and auto parts manufacturing plummeted more than 70%, the biggest industry-group decline in the Fed's index.

Capacity utilization, a metric that tracks the amount of a factory being used, declined 8.3 percentage points to 64.9 last month. The rate sits 14.9 percentage points below its average from 1972 to 2019, and slightly below its last all-time low seen during the financial crisis.

Even as the US pivots to economic reopening plans, factories are unlikely to see the smooth recovery hoped for in other sectors. Manufacturing activity declined relatively early in the pandemic's life, as supply chain disruptions slowed production before outbreaks cropped up in the US.

Weakened demand, lasting uncertainty, and fiscal tightening will delay a return to past levels of output by more than a year, Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said Friday.

""The coronavirus causes the gears of industrial activity to grind to a halt,"" he wrote in an emailed note. ""We forecast that industrial output losses will not be recovered until late-2021.""

The bleak industrial data joins several other reports detailing the economic damage sourced from the coronavirus pandemic. Weekly jobless claims reached 3 million last week, the Labor Department announced Thursday, bringing the metric's eight-week total to more than 36 million Americans.

Retail sales data released Friday showed a record 16.4% decline in consumer spending, trouncing the 12% drop expected by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The reading nearly doubled March's then-record plunge of 8.3%.",real

Everything’s fine if it fits the narrative, Bloomberg Opinion editors might have thought when they misquoted World Bank statistics on the number of hospital beds per 1,000 residents, including the misrepresented data in a Russia-bashing op-ed by Clara Ferreira Marques, titled ‘How Putin’s Russia Bungled the Pandemic’.

Taking a swipe at Russia’s efforts to upgrade the Soviet healthcare system to make it less cumbersome and more effective, the piece argued that the endeavor failed, only leading to a drop in hospitals, beds available, and doctors.

To back up the premise, the article featured a graph claiming to be based on 2013 data from the World Bank. However, according to the World Bank’s actual stats, while Russia had over twice as many beds in 2013 (8.2 versus 3.8 per 1,000), the initial version of the Bloomberg story had Russia lagging far behind the OECD countries by the same margin.

The blunder did not go unnoticed by the Russian Embassy in the US, which accused Bloomberg of promoting a new barrage of “politicized allegations” with “fake” stats.

“We demand that Bloomberg Opinion refute, apologize and respect its own customers,” the embassy said in a Facebook statement.

We are convinced that readers and viewers of the leading American media deserve verified, but not deliberately distorted, information.

Several hours after the embassy voiced its protest, Bloomberg Opinion amended the article, embedding a correct version of the graph instead of the misleading one.

The blunder came just days after Bloomberg ran another story about Covid-19 and Russia that raised some eyebrows. “Experts Want to Know Why Coronavirus Hasn’t Killed More Russians,” the initial headline stated, in what many commenters saw as the outlet’s disappointment in the country’s relatively low death toll. It has since been changed twice to sound more neutral.

Other Western media outlets seem to be taking the same misleading doom-and-gloom approach in covering Russia’s fight with the epidemic. Last week, CNN declared Moscow “devastated” based on the number of identified cases, which came with increasingly large-scale testing.

Meanwhile, the New York Times and Financial Times seem to imply that the Russian government is covering up the damage done by the epidemic with the creative use of official mortality statistics. The mystery of Russia’s low death toll was thus “solved” by the Western press. But when the Russian Embassy in the US tried to have the New York Times print comparative statistics for Moscow, New York City, and London to give readers some proper context, it refused, according to the diplomats.

Socialism, Sharia law and Islam are creeping in while we are all distracted with authoritarian Coronavirus lockdown orders.

The Muslim community has been flexing its muscle since government officials have ordered unconstitutional lockdown orders across the country.

Culver City is the latest Southern California city to allow the Islamic call to prayer, or “adhan,” to blare five times a day from a loudspeaker (beginning at 4:30 AM) during the Coronavirus shutdown.

Many residents in Culver City however say the Islamic call to prayer is too loud and made formal complaints to the police department.

The police department revoked the amplified noise permit after numerous complaints from residents.

However, three days later, the city reinstated the permit if the mosque agreed to lower the volume.

Los Angeles Time reported:

Outside the Culver City mosque, some pedestrians stopped in their tracks when they first heard the adhan, seemingly surprised. This was something new, and it was not altogether clear how it would be received — as with many things Muslim in the U.S. But in Culver City, the call to prayer did not go unchallenged for long. After four days, on May 18, the city’s police department revoked the amplified noise permit, citing people congregating at the mosque in violation of the county health order, as well as “numerous loud noise complaints from area residents.” “We have had and will continue to have a great relationship with mosque leadership,” said Capt. Jason Sims with the Culver City Police Department. “We are certainly happy to help with facilitating any type of service that is not in violation of county health orders.” Three days later, the city changed course again, reinstating the permit on the condition that the mosque lower the volume. Meanwhile, on the Nextdoor social networking app, debates raged between neighbors.

Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.,"Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.

Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.

Poll(s) of the week

So far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it’s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.

According to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, “We are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,” which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.

The polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month’s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week’s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality — including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats — believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.

Concerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight’s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are “somewhat” or “very” concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.

And the share of Americans who say they’re concerned about the virus’s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same — hovering at around 87 percent — for the past six weeks.

The share of Americans who approve of Trump’s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he’s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.

Attitudes toward Trump’s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however — according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials’ work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a “good” or “excellent” job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a “good” or “excellent” job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.

However, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places — despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they’re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn’t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.

Other polling bites

According to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters — including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats — said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn’t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).

A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was “something from nature” or “created by people, on purpose,” with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.

Half of Americans said they would be “somewhat” or “very” likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn’t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they’d be likely to use it.

An SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.

According to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.

Trump approval

According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.

Generic ballot

In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).

That is how civilized societies reward teenagers and young adults for wrapping up four years of general education. But the coronavirus changes everything, in the way money behaves in the Cyndi Lauper song “Money Changes Everything.” I wish I could be like the millions of people who can turn out a fulsome praise to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy.

Instead, I’d like to pay honor to the class of 2020 by giving them the precious gift of honesty. This crop of graduates has been lied to, probably more than any other. I should know, because for all the years they’ve lived, I was inside the machine that manufactured the lies.

This year I graduated at the age of forty-nine in my own way. After twenty years of teaching college students, I finally left my last academic job and moved on from academia. I watched twenty classes of students move through the system while these current graduates incubated. My departure was as unceremonious as their non-ceremonies are going to be.

So here’s some truth that needs to be told: Your teachers didn’t know what they were talking about most of the time. I know you may have liked many of them, but that’s a kind of Stockholm Syndrome you get from the deliberate mental work the institutions do on you. You’re in school and they are the ones to whom you are captive. That’s why they may have seemed so kind; they needed you to give them high teaching evaluations so they could be promoted.

The people who taught you English were trained by unhinged Marxists who never made them read much classic literature before throwing them in the classroom to teach you. They rarely studied any foreign languages so had no grasp of world literature or classical literature. They were trained to disregard the Christian Bible so they lacked any meaningful connection to the thousands of years that the Bible and churches influenced artistic expression. The departments that hired them wanted chatty courtiers who could talk about glossy critical theories. Search committees didn’t hire literature professors who had a broad background, largely because the people on the hiring committees lacked the range to understand what they were talking about in job interviews. So you got the teacher who showed up talking about feminist readings of Jane Austen novels, like a million other grad students.

I know this because I sat through graduate school in the 1990s and went to conference after conference with English teachers. They did master’s theses and doctoral dissertations on idiotic pet theories that fascinated their advisors. In order to fund their reckless forays into illustrated children’s literature, erotica, music videos and other esoteric tomfoolery, they held their noses and studied composition and rhetoric so they could get jobs teaching young people how to write papers. So you were the cash crop that funded their dilettantism. If they made Shakespeare, Milton, and Henry James feel accessible to you, that’s likely because they were going off the Sparknotes just as you were. They made it accessible because they only knew as much as you did about the texts.

Most of what they told you about how to write is awful advice. The “rhetorical fallacies” like the straw man, red herring, and post hoc ergo propter hoc, are actually effective forms of persuasion that have served great commentators well from Demosthenes to Malcolm X. Ad hominem attacks make the world go round, contrary to what you’ve heard; the Declaration of Independence, remember, was a long personal attack on King George III. The human mind doesn’t react well to dry, dispassionate five-paragraph essays written by people who were forbidden from using “I” and discouraged from suggesting anything interesting or new. Once you graduate from college, nobody will ever ask you to write a 5-7 page paper with a topic sentence and formulaic presentations of evidence. Your teachers had to consume large amounts of alcohol to read those papers you hated writing.

Some of your English teachers may have followed their own suffocating rules of composition. If they did, they joined the ranks of those who write 25-page articles that take four years to get into print at a peer-reviewed journal, to be read by three grad students who stumbled on it on J-STOR when they were looking for something else. Most of your English teachers, though, broke the rules if they wrote anything impactful. They rolled up their sleeves, jumped on social media, and started flinging irresponsible mud at people over topics they felt emotional about. In other words, they were like Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Emile Zola, Jean-Paul Sartre, and George Orwell. Passionate people worth studying.

But no matter how much you rave about the way your English teachers loved you and changed your life, the truth is they were horrible people. I worked alongside them for two decades. These are people who would strangle kittens for tenure. They pulled childish tricks to rig their student evaluations and nominated themselves for excellence in teaching awards. For all their prattle about sexual and racial equality, they zipped their mouths about colleagues abusing students. They did nothing when tenure review boards went after minority teachers. If it seemed like you had very few teachers of color and all the ones you had focused on ethnic studies, that’s because all the classicists of color were driven out of the academy for being self-hating Uncle Toms. Trust me. I lived that ugly routine at four different colleges.

You may think of yourself as liberal or conservative, but you’re probably neither. If you were a true leftist, you’d be staging protests against the abusive student debt and the hideous labor conditions of academia. You’d care about the adjuncts who teach 70% of your classes. When I was in college we built shanties to protest South African apartheid and some of us shouted at deans over campus governance, instead of working with “deans of diversity” to hold harmless parades about safe spaces for people of color and transgender track and field runners. The left you know is a phony game of distraction, designed to keep you unworried about the tuition they’ve extorted from you. Most of what the left preaches, whether it’s green energy or MeToo, ends up being consumerism and celebrity culture, which is really the same thing. Buy a Taylor Swift CD to show solidarity because someone grabbed her at a concert in Colorado. Log onto Google with your smart phone to learn about windmills and solar. Let’s pretend a Twitter mobbing against someone who said something homophobic in 1991 is left-wing activism… not.

I wrote Wackos, Thugs, and Perverts in 2017 to roll out the three basic flavors of educational progressives: wackos who are simply lunatics, thugs who will engage in all kinds of unethical behavior for a quick buck or power, and perverts who project their unhealthy obsessions onto their academic expertise. That’s the left you’ve seen. You’d be triggered in a nanosecond if you had to speak to an actual radical from the 1970s who wanted to push for social change. You’d probably accuse the person of mansplaining.

Even if you think you’re conservative, you’re probably not that either. Maybe you read the Daily Wire and love hearing Ben Shapiro say “facts don’t care about your feelings.” But if you were conservative, you’d be courageous enough to stand up for traditional values. In educational settings the few self-identified “conservatives” tend to come in three flavors: creeps, cretins, and cowards. The creeps were the libertarian profiteers who saw money to be made in the aftermath of pseudo-liberal destruction in the academic world; they make a living by dressing-up pro-corporate propaganda in Christian platitudes so it can be sold as Reagan’s three-legged stool to people who have no memory of what that was. The cretins were conservatives who had no concept of wolves in sheep’s clothing, and glommed onto numerous creeps (see prior sentence). The cowards were people who knew what traditional values were but didn’t want to jeopardize their chance of going to Harvard Law School or something.

All three of these conservative characters were completely useless. That’s why their movement got nowhere even as Ben Shapiro got invited to speak at campus after campus.

Whether you thought of yourself as conservative or liberal, you were really pseudo-libertarian, which is the default setting of both the Millennials and Generation Z. You wanted the experience of low-cost piety and reckless self-righteous adventures that involved no risk to yourself. You wanted to be able to snitch on your teachers and get them fired but you also wanted a small and non-intrusive government that would allow your gay classmates to make out at the senior prom. This is not your fault. During the last twenty years the entire educational system was rigged to foster that behavior in you because it kept you self-absorbed and ultimately unwilling to question the status quo. Other generations, like mine, rebelled against our teachers to feel cool. Your generations aped and flattered your supposedly progressive teachers to feel rebellious, which wasn’t necessarily cool, just the perpetually new normal.

As you get ready to start the next phase of your life, you are blessed to have had coronavirus overshadow your graduation. You have had a wakeup call that I haven’t seen students receive in twenty years. When I tried to explain to previous classes that experts were not as knowledgeable and all-powerful as people assumed they were, they wouldn’t believe me. The whole system told them that the APA, AMA, NEA, MLA, ALA, NEH, NIH, CDC, DOJ, and the rest were the gold standard. Now you’ve had your commencement canceled because these experts said everyone had to stay home for two months, since they couldn’t think of anything else to do about a virus. You sat at home wasting day after day with nothing to do while the experts couldn’t pull together a large-scale triage system, distribute reliable antibodies tests, or find treatment for people who got infected. After billions in science funding, this. If you’re paying attention, you’ve realized they’re a clown show.

What might feel scary to you could also become a sense of liberation. You hold a golden place of history. God gave you a graduation present: insight into the inner workings of a society that had spent at least sixty years convincing itself that their lies were real. In truth, human beings are still fragile organisms who can’t be saved by experts, degrees, courses of study, diplomas, transcripts, papers, conferences, or grades. People who seemed all-powerful and unquestionable to classes that came before you now stand exposed for being less than a wizard behind a curtain. They’re the bobblehead behind a telescreen (pace Orwell).

Please forgive me for speaking so frankly to you. You’ve been had. But you can’t be had any longer, since everything is breaking down. You didn’t ask for my advice but I’ll give it to you. You should stand up and fight the system at this point, whether you’re left or right. Past generations risked their safety to engage in real civil disobedience. Read Thoreau if it helps. When you’re young and not set in your career, you have more freedom than you can imagine. I wish I’d taken a stand for my beliefs at 19, so I didn’t have to take the stand at 49 with two kids, a wife, and a mortgage to worry about. I don’t regret my choices but my timing. If you don’t avail yourself of your freedom now, chances are you’ll be part of the machine for the rest of your life. And the machine is broken.

1951,1164,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/democrats-push-new-3t-coronavirus-relief-bill-through-house,2020-05-16,Democrats push new $3T coronavirus relief bill through House,"WASHINGTON — Democrats have powered a massive $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill through the House, an election-year measure designed to brace a U.S. economy in free fall and a health care system struggling to contain a pandemic still pummeling the country.

Friday’s 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

Republicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states’ partial business reopenings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.

Republicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.

“Phase Four is going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. “But it’s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.”

Trump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet onboard.

The daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that’s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.

Many members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.

To enhance the bill’s political impact, Democrats named their measure “The Heroes Act” for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.

“Are you kidding me?” said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. “Where do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?”

Republicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry’s access to banks.

“It may help the cannabis industry, but it won’t help Main Street,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

Pelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers’ salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.

Fourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party’s most vulnerable lawmakers in November’s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.

Among them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure “bloated.” Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, “This bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.”

Republicans were already planning to use the day’s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday’s legislation and face competitive reelection races.

Clearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren’t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.

Some congressional aides said the Democratic bill’s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an “employee retention” tax credit for businesses more generous.

Republicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.

“This bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is “going nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.”

Liberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, “I can’t tell them yes.”

The lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.",real
1963,5,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/1/27/21111134/coronavirus-china-deaths-us-evacuation,2020-01-27,China reports 25 coronavirus deaths; US prepares evacuation,"BEIJING — China on Tuesday reported 25 more deaths from a new viral disease, raising the total to at least 106, as the U.S. government prepared to fly Americans out of the city at the center of the outbreak.

Health authorities in Hubei province, where the coronavirus first was detected in in December, reported 24 deaths and those in Beijing reported the Chinese capital’s first fatality. No national toll was announced, but 81 other deaths had been reported through Monday.

The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where authorities cut off most access Jan. 22 in an effort to contain the disease, was preparing to fly its diplomats and some other Americans out of the city. Japan, France and Mongolia and other governments also were preparing evacuations.

China had expanded its already sweeping disease-control efforts by extending the end of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday, the country’s busiest travel season, by three days to Sunday to keep the public at home and reduce the risk infection will spread.

Mongolia closed its vast border with China. Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they were barring entry to visitors from Hubei province. Chinese travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.

U.S. health officials expanded their recommendation for people to avoid non-essential travel to any part of China, rather than just Wuhan and other areas most affected by the outbreak.

On Tuesday, English-proficiency and other tests for students to apply to foreign universities were canceled. Public schools and universities have been ordered to postpone reopening following the Lunar New Year holiday until further notice.

Stock markets around the world were down sharply Monday as investors worried the outbreak could hurt the global economy.

China has confirmed more than 2,700 cases of the new virus, most in Wuhan. More than 40 cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the world. Almost involve Chinese tourists or people who visited Wuhan.

China’s increasingly drastic containment efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. That lockdown has expanded to 17 cities with more than 50 million people — the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

The epidemic has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people. Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.

Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.

The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.

The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and urged people to stop eating meat from them.",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

COVID-19 attaches and binds to target cells through ACE2 protein sites on cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys and blood vessels.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 sites are increased [2] by Ibuprofen, antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBS, Thiazolidedinones, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The most frequent comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases that have been reported thus far in those with COVID-19, and these are typically treated with ACE inhibitors, although this was not mentioned in the studies.

The higher level of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may increase infection with COVID-19 and consequently may also increase the risks for both severe and fatal infection of the COVID-19 virus. However, antihypertensive calcium channel blockers [3] don’t increase ACE2, and should be taken into consideration as a possible alternative drug and may be worth having a conversation with your prescribing physician about.

Examples of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors include:

Captopril (Capoten),

Enalapril (Vasotec),

Fosinopril (Monopril),

Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril),

Moexipril (Univasc)

Perindopril (Aceon),

Quinapril (Accupril),

Ramipril (Altace),

Slate is making its essential coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.

Mr. X had been on a ventilator for more than three weeks when he died for the first time, the second time, the third time, and the fourth and final time. Each time he died, his heart stopped beating. Each time we performed chest compressions, gave him eleventh-hour medications, and resuscitated him, until the final time. None of it would have happened if Mr. X had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

While Mr. X was my patient for only a few days, the truth is that there have been tens of thousands like him across the United States over the past three months, men and women who have died of the coronavirus—more than 85,000 as of this writing. Despite our communal response to COVID-19, I fear there may still be tens of thousands yet to come if not more. For that reason, it is important the story of Mr. X and his death be told. He was a unique person with a singular life, but in terms of dying from the coronavirus, he could have been you, me, or anyone.

He was not a young man, but he was not especially old either. He was in his 70s, the same age as my parents. He had an irregular heart beat for which he took blood thinners and an immune condition for which he took a low dose of daily steroid. Like 1 in 10 of the U.S. population, he had diabetes. Long ago he suffered a mild stroke.

Upon his death, he had already been treated in the ICU with antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia three times. A few days earlier, he had a heart attack on account of the stresses critical illness was placing on his body. This was despite already being on high-dose steroids to boost his insufficient adrenal glands in coping with that stress.

When he came into the emergency department three weeks earlier, he had only been sick for less than a day with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a cough. Six hours later he was gasping for air, intubated with a tube down his throat, and put on a breathing machine like nearly 11 percent of people with COVID-19 in hospitals. Tragically roughly half those intubated people end up dying of acute respiratory distress syndrome, lungs that are so critically damaged by COVID-19 that they cease being able to deliver oxygen into the blood. This was the fate of Mr. X.

For days after his admission into the hospital, Mr. X was also in septic shock. His blood pressure was dangerously low and supported with medication delivered through an intravenous tube placed into the jugular vein in the right side of his neck. Its tip ended in the big vein that fed the right side of his heart, allowing for medication to instantaneously mix into the blood.

Despite all this, there were moments of hope. At some point, Mr. X no longer required medication to maintain his blood pressure. The level of oxygen needed through his breathing tube decreased. His support was weaned. But in this lull, multiple tests of whether Mr. X had the strength to come off his ventilator ended in failure, with hope always lying in trying again the next day.

But after steadily improving over weeks, he quickly began to worsen over a single day. The first time his heart stopped was at noon that day. His blood pressure plummeted, and his heart rate dropped. Everyone in the ICU was at the ready when his pulse disappeared and CPR was started. Six minutes and two doses of epinephrine later, his pulse returned. He was alive again.

Forty minute later, Mr. X died a second time. A “CODE BLUE” was announced over the hospital speakers. Three minutes later, there was a pulse. An emergency ultrasound showed strain in his right heart indirectly pointing toward a massive blood clot in the lungs despite his blood thinner; he received an urgent clot-busting infusion twice.

Then, 20 minutes later, his pulse disappeared a third time as Mr. X’s heart went into ventricular fibrillation, a twitchy, shockable rhythm. In five minutes, he received two shocks at 200 joules each and his pulse returned. But the situation was dire with blood tests showing such profound abnormalities that we all knew we were no longer extending Mr. X’s life insomuch as prolonging his death.

We spoke to his family throughout Mr. X’s ordeal. We all agreed not to start compressions if his heart stopped a fourth time. In three weeks, they were never able to visit him in the hospital. But as his medical team, we called them every day with updates.

Mr. X died an hour after we decided not to start compressions again, at 3:38 p.m. A nurse held his left hand while a doctor held his right hand as his heartbeat gradually slowed before it disappeared forever. His family received their last phone call from the doctor with the sadly expected news.

Mr. X died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The story of his death is his, but I worry there will be many more to come, with stories that start to feel familiar.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Plan To Mitigate The Foreign Born Viral Coronavirus Invasion To America

There are simple and straightforward methods to blunt the coronavirus effects on America, given what we know about the spread of this virus, specific actions need to be implemented immediately. The facts are that the virus cannot spread without it getting access to a victim's mucus membranes via eyes, ears, and nose.

Staff on airplanes and other public transport in high-risk situations of coming into contact with those who are infected, should be issued simple reusable masks and gloves made from an ion infused copper cotton material that is anti-viral on contact. The cotton should be infused with copper ions which kill viruses on contact, and thus wearing a copper infused cotton mask with or without an N95 or N99 filters are a superior protection choice.

Prevention of mucus membrane exposure through contact with the hands or through inhalation along with use of tight fitting glasses will protect against cough droplets in the air, this is protection that can be manufactured inexpensively. Issuing colloidal silver in spray bottles to wash eyes will also greatly reduce risk of infection. A colloidal silver solution at 100 ppm is non irritating and universally viracidal as well as only costing a few cents per gallon to the manufacturer.

Technology now exists using nanotech vibrational tuning rods to detect the most infinitesimal amount of a discrete virus in solution. This technology is accurate to picogram scale. Originally developed in Germany, this technology has been commercialized and is being used for the detection of minute toxins in environmental materials. The same technology could be implemented for a very quick and inexpensive test for the virus, which would be much faster, cheaper and more accurate than the PCR technology currently being used. This would allow for instant screening of large numbers of people in rapid fashion at airports and other transportation ports as well as in the hospital and healthcare environments.

In the past HEPA air filters were in common use because the airlines knew that the air in the cabins was recirculating previously breathed air and could increase the risk of spreading airborne infection. Unfortunately today they do not use these advanced filtration systems, as that raised the modest cost to the airlines per flight, and to save this small amount of money they discontinued use of these air filters. Additionally, the airlines insist on flying with the air vents closed in order to again save on the costs of a small amount of jet fuel being used in heating the air for the cockpit and the cabin. It would be a simple solution to install HEPA filters again in the air filtration systems. Airliners and cruise ships should also open the air vents to allow for less cross-contamination and rebreathing of stale air.

A further solution would be the use of commercially available ozone generating machines between flights and airline cabins to detox and disinfect the cabin air and surfaces. A blast of ozone is a superb disinfectant and could easily cleanse an airline cabin in 20 to 30 minutes; the same technology would be effective for cruise ships and trains as well.

There are thousands of natural drugs, herbals, chemicals, plants and physical substances that have viral inhibiting and viral destructive capacity. A single lab could be used to test out these many products for the potential of a safe nontoxic answer to the coronavirus infection. A single lab with automated viral culture mass screening could quickly show which of the thousands of chemicals, drugs and other products of nature will stop this virus.

Finally quarantine at home does not work and will not work as this virus has a long wait and see incubation period. It is also near impossible to keep people completely isolated. The answer is neighborhood isolation trailers that could be constructed quickly and easily, these could be delivered to a specific location where people in quarantine could be housed in near where they live. These isolation homes where the air would be filtered and the sewage would be kept in special isolated disinfected septic tanks, would allow for families to visit via large windows without risking contamination and delivery of food to their relatives via a two-way isolation door system. This would be a more humane and effective means of maintaining strict isolation, while maintaining people in their own community and not overwhelming hospitals with the burden of highly infectious diseased individuals.

Patients on homecare with oxygen and BiPAP positive pressure airway therapy, would be on constant monitoring via telemedicine and Internet cameras, as well as medical telemetry to monitor their respiratory rate as well as their SA02 oxygen saturation, along with EKG, heart rate and their blood pressure. This monitoring could be accomplished via computer systems so that it was automated, again taking the strain and the stress away from the overburdened healthcare community.

Should a patient’s condition begin faltering, a team of highly trained intensive care technicians in full hazmat isolation gear could be dispatched to the patient’s location in a matter of minutes, or just to ensure that a patient on homecare was receiving good care. This system may be even better than patient care in the hospital and would allow for patients who were deteriorating on homecare, to be rapidly transferred to hospital based respiratory intensive care units.

Realize these technologies are off the shelf and are available at this very moment. The only question is the actual implementation of the system of remote controlled advanced high-tech medical care. This program could be in working status in a matter of days, and the cost savings would be immeasurable... the savings of lives.... would be even greater. All this with the added benefit of patients being able to isolate themselves at home in familiar environments, with the support of their already exposed family members.

Utilizing an advanced use of CPAP, as well as remote teams of respiratory intensive care technicians, virtual reality tele-medicine, health monitoring telemetry, positive pressure oxygen therapy, and airway support could be an absolute game changer never seen before in the annals of healthcare.

We owe the American people the best that we can provide.

This worldwide pandemic is a manageable problem that need not lead to mass disruption or mass deaths. There is certainly a drug or many drugs that can inhibit this virus and prevent it’s furthered deadly outcome. The simplest of which are measures to protect your mucous membranes and to protect your hands from becoming germ transmitters.

The American public deserves a better, more intelligent and more humane public health response from its Government. The above measures would give that to them at minimum cost and could be implemented in the matter of days, with no barriers stopping effective public health responses to this contagion impending threat to our nation.

God bless America and God bless its leaders who take appropriate action to protect its citizens.

As significantly more people are using these videoconferencing services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the domains could be used to pose as official links, potentially tricking people into downloading malware or accidentally giving a bad actor access to personal information.

In just the last three weeks, for example, 2,449 Zoom-related domains have been registered, and Check Point Research determined that 32 of those domains are malicious and 320 are “suspicious.” And in one instance of attempted phishing, hackers sent an email that looks like an official email from Microsoft Teams, but a button in the email to “open” Teams was actually a malicious URL that downloaded malware to the user’s computer.

Francisco Morales Torres has spent the past year and a half locked up at the Dodge County jail in Juneau, Wisconsin, under the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

An immigration judge in Chicago granted Morales Torres asylum in 2019 and again in February, but government prosecutors have appealed both rulings. As those appeals make their way through the courts, Morales Torres — who has anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses — is unlikely to be released from ICE custody.

His lawyers have turned to the District Court of Eastern Wisconsin to win his release, arguing his prolonged detention violates the due process clause of the Constitution and puts him at risk of contracting COVID-19.

“A lot of us in here already didn’t know when we were going to see our families again, but now with the coronavirus, there’s an added fear of dying,” Morales Torres said in a phone call from Dodge County jail Wednesday. “We don’t know what’s going on. It’s only a matter of time before something happens.”

ICE declined to comment for this story citing pending litigation.

Court records show Morales Torres came to the United States in 2007 at age 13. He entered the country without proper authorization and was later taken into ICE custody and placed in deportation proceedings in September 2018 after several run-ins with the law, including a conviction for possession of a stolen vehicle.

While in detention, Morales Torres was granted asylum by Immigration Judge Kathryn De Angelis in April 2019 based on fears of being persecuted in Mexico for his sexual orientation and because he has acute psychiatric illnesses.

Government prosecutors appealed the ruling, and the case was returned to De Angelis in October 2019.

Five months later, De Angelis again granted Morales Torres protection from deportation as “he will face a substantial risk of torture if he is removed to Mexico because of his severe mental health illnesses, his lack of familial support, and his sexual orientation,” she wrote.

Prosecutors appealed De Angelis’ second ruling, which remains pending.

Keren Zwick, one of three attorneys at the National Immigrant Justice Center working on Morales Torres’ case, said it could take more than a year before the courts get through both appeals. Zwick worries that by then the coronavirus will have reached Dodge County.

“These facilities routinely take in people from other county jails or detention centers where outbreaks of the virus have been confirmed,” she said. “Congregate settings like these are ill-equipped to handle the virus.”

As of last week, there were 30,000 immigrants in ICE custody. So far, the agency has tested 995 of them for the coronavirus and 449 tested positive, including 12 at a county jail in downstate Illinois.

SUMMARY: Yes, but what about our plan for the coronavirus? Layoffs are horrible, but kudos to Airbnb for handling them as well as possible. People are increasingly ignoring distancing measures. Dr. Fauci as sex symbol.

What's our plan, Mr. President?

President Trump says we're moving into the next phase of our coronavirus response — reopening. He's acknowledging that the death counts will be much higher than he thought only a few weeks ago. He's urging Americans to view themselves as ""warriors"" and return to their lives.

Trump's motivation for reopening the economy is obvious: Our lives have been upended by the coronavirus, and our economy has been destroyed. The ""cure"" may not be worse than the disease, but it's terrible.

The president's logic is also understandable. We cannot stay ""locked down"" forever. On our current trajectory, it would take us months if not years to crush the virus the way South Korea, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Austria, and other countries have. So continuing with the status quo indefinitely is not really an option.

But giving up on the coronavirus and focusing just on the economy is appalling, especially considering how well other countries like South Korea and Germany have dealt with this crisis.

After all, there's a lot more we could be doing. As Derek Thompson explains in The Atlantic, only a couple of months ago, South Korea and the US had the same number of cases and deaths. Now, thanks to an aggressive and competent government response, South Korea has reduced new cases of the virus to a trickle, while the US death toll is 72,000 and climbing.

We know what the president's economic plan is: Reopen the country.

But it is fair to also ask what his coronavirus plan is.

There are really only two options.

Double down. Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread.

Ramp up the aggressive response that has worked in South Korea and elsewhere: Continue to build testing, contact-tracing, and isolation capacity. Order companies to make more personal protection equipment and healthcare capacity. Give funding to states and municipalities. Form partnerships with other countries. Do whatever else can be done to reduce deaths and sickness and control the spread. Hope for the best. Hope we get a treatment or vaccine or reach ""herd immunity"" before too many more people die.

Trump appears to be pursuing the second option.

What's particularly frustrating and mystifying about this is that the president doesn't have to choose. He could have his cake and eat it, too. He has nearly unlimited resources. He could cautiously reopen the country and double down on mitigation and control measures.

After all, the choice here is not the coronavirus OR the economy — it's both.

Our economy won't repair itself until we all feel safe eating out, traveling, attending events, and socializing in groups again. And it won't be a government mandate that makes us feel safe. It will be seeing the number of infections and deaths continuing to drop.

So let's hope the president does more than just hope for the best.

Airbnb shows the right way to conduct layoffs during the pandemic

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky. REUTERS/Mike Segar

Tuesday's news that Airbnb is laying off 25% of its 7,500 employees is sad and not at all surprising, given how the pandemic has devastated the travel industry.

But as Shana Lebowitz reports in Insider, how Airbnb is carrying out the layoffs should be a model for other struggling companies.

Executives usually screw up this process, spreading fear by letting news of layoffs dribble out in advance, callously firing people in large groups, and not bothering to explain the strategic reason for layoffs.

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky did everything right, Lebowitz concludes. Chesky's memo explained the strategic reasoning behind the layoffs, prepared those being laid off for one-on-one meetings with managers, offered generous severance, benefits, and career counseling, and, perhaps most important, treated those losing their jobs with compassion.

""I am truly sorry. Please know this is not your fault,"" Chesky wrote. ""The world will never stop seeking the qualities and talents that you brought to Airbnb ... that helped make Airbnb. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing them with us.""

People are increasingly ignoring coronavirus restrictions, and that's alarming

Everywhere you look there are signs of rising noncompliance with our social-distancing guidelines.

In one Miami Beach park, police verbally warned more than 7,000 people about mask-wearing, prompting authorities to shut the just opened park back down. A guard at a Family Dollar was shot dead by a customer when he tried to enforce Michigan's mandatory mask policy. The Wisconsin Supreme Court looks likely to throw out the state's stay-at-home order, with one justice calling it ""the very definition of tyranny."" Even Trump and Vice President Pence have been modeling noncompliance by declining to wear face masks in places where they're recommended or required.

What a pickle! It's possible to create a virtuous cycle with restrictive public-health measures, as we've seen in countries such as Korea and New Zealand: Clear government communication, strict controls, and competence persuade people to comply with restrictive orders. The public then sees the crisis abate, appreciates the strict measures, and trusts the government to guide the reopening.

Instead, we've put ourselves in a vicious cycle. Unclear leadership, ambiguous rules, and government incompetence cast doubt on the control measures. Physical distancing can only suppress the epidemic if the vast majority of us practice it, and the vast majority will practice it only if they support it and think it's a legitimate recommendation from trusted authorities. But if the authorities themselves don't practice it, or label it tyranny as in Wisconsin, or are too heavy handed as in Miami, compliance will wane, and the disease will rise.

That's the direction we're heading. And what's unsettling is that once the public's trust is lost, the government will have a tough time regaining it. If we botched this first effort so badly, will enough of us follow government restrictions if the disease keeps flaring up?

Pew tweeted, “Hispanics are the most supportive of the federal government providing medical and economic support to undocumented immigrants affected by the coronavirus outbreak.”

Approximately two-thirds of U.S. adults (68 percent) believe the federal government has an obligation to provide medical care to illegal aliens who caught the Wuhan virus. Additionally, 37 percent stated that the government should supply economic aid to illegal aliens who have lost their job due to the outbreak, according to a Pew Research Center survey that was conducted from April 29 to May 5.

Hispanics were the group most in favor of the federal government allocating medical and economic resources to illegal immigrants affected by the Wuhan virus outbreak. The vast majority of Hispanics (86 percent) say the government has an obligation to provide medical care, and 62 percent had similar thoughts about economic help. Hispanic immigrants are more likely than American-born Hispanics (68 percent vs. 55 percent) to support federal economic help for illegal aliens affected by the outbreak. However, the views between the two groups were more similar regarding medical care (88 percent vs. 83 percent).

The Hawks canceled the 13th edition of the event — slated for July 24-26 — on Wednesday, citing the uncertain status of the rest of the 2019-20 NHL season and the advice of public-health officials. Full refunds for previously purchased convention passes and hotel rooms will be issued.

The 2019 convention drew thousands of fans to downtown Chicago for autograph sessions, meet-and-greets, new-player introductions, alumni and front-office panels and numerous other types of programming. It spanned from Friday night through Sunday afternoon, just as this edition was supposed to do.

Illinois’ ban on large gatherings — although it doesn’t extend anywhere near late July yet — theoretically would make the convention impossible. And even if the ban were to be lifted by then, many fans might be reluctant to attend, given the close proximity they would have with thousands of others, leading to attendance concerns.

There’s also a chance the NHL season will resume around that point of the summer, although a plethora of obstacles would lie in the way of that.

If the season does resume, the most likely way would seem to be in a single, neutral-site city, ideally one with relatively few coronavirus cases but with infrastructure sufficient enough to house thousands of players, coaches, league officials, TV crews and more. Even still, the games almost certainly would be held in empty arenas.

So far, cities reportedly under consideration are Grand Forks, North Dakota; Manchester, New Hampshire; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Grand Forks is home to the University of North Dakota’s hockey facilities. Manchester’s SNHU Arena is the former home of a Kings minor-league affiliate. Saskatoon’s spacious SaskTel Centre typically hosts the Blades of the Western Hockey League.

But the NHL is far away from making any serious commitments to such sites, and little is known about what the format the end of the season would look like. Unless the regular season was resumed or the playoff field was expanded, the Hawks wouldn’t take part.",real

HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.

Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.

Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.

Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.

The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.

“Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.

It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement.",real

Peskov made his last public appearance on April 30 at a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. However, it remains unknown whether the Kremlin representative contacted the president.

It was also said that Peskov was hospitalized.

The total number of positive cases in Russia since the beginning of the pandemic has exceeded 232,000 people.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Here's what they look like.","IHG, Four Seasons, Omni and Caesars joined the growing list of hospitality companies updating cleanliness measures due to the new coronavirus. Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.

IHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, ""last cleaned"" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.

Four Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, ""Lead With Care."" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.

Omni's ""Safe & Clean"" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.

Caesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.

Accor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants

Accor's ""ALLSAFE"" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.

MGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor

MGM launched its ""Seven-Point Safety Plan,"" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.

In addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:

Screening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.

Mandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.

Physical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. ""From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging – and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,"" according to the new policy.

Hand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.

HVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.

Red Roof's RediClean initiative launches

The budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.

Red Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.

The company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult — think laundry rooms or indoor hallways — guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.

Wyndham: 'Count on Us'

Wyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called ""Count on Us"", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.

The chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.

Best Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan

Meanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered ""We Care Clean"" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.

The hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.

Sandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'

Sandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.

Vrbo

Vrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.

Homeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.

The company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.

Hyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process

Hyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.

""We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point – from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining – bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,"" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.

By September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a ""hygiene manager,"" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.

These may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.

Hyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.

The company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.

Hyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.

As individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.

The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.

""It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,"" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.

The report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.

Hilton's new cleaning protocols

Hilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called ""Hilton CleanStay"" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.

Full details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:

An official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning

The removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)

Contactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)

Electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light to be used in the sanitization process

Marriott updates cleaning procedures

Marriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.

In addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to remind anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.

Choice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program

Choice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.

The ""Commitment to Clean"" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.

Airbnb issues cleaning recommendations

Airbnb is establishing a new recommended ""cleaning protocol"" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.

For hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.

Turnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips

The vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.

Now the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.

It will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.

2027,1753,http://sputniknews.com/europe/202005221079382840-sugar-dating-sweden-sounds-the-alarm-over-coronavirus-induced-underage-prostitution/,2020-05-22,'Sugar Dating': Sweden Sounds the Alarm Over Coronavirus-Induced Underage Prostitution,"The rookie sex workers, revealed during a recent police operation, claim to have lost their normal income due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Swedish police and social services have sounded the alarm over a new phenomenon: young people selling themselves to make ends meet after admittedly having lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 epidemic.

“Their parents also spoke about this. We are talking low-paying jobs, such as fast-food restaurants,” Malin Andersson, Secretary of Social Affairs for the Stockholm City Youth Rapid Response Team, told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

During the recent Operation Cod that targeted sex buyers in Stockholm, the police identified at least five people below the age of 18 who provided sexual services for money. Their sex ads said “Lost my extra job”, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported.

“We clearly see increased activity among young people,” Detective Inspector Simon Häggström told Svenska Dagbladet. “They themselves say this is due to corona, that they have no job, and that they just sit at home. It is definitely a new group of young people making their debut now. It's alarming,” Häggström added.

Andersson said that some young people have been feeling unwell psychologically, and this trend only worsened while the schools were closed.

“They feel isolated. If a person falls into this sphere, usually there are some reasons. Everyone there feels bad, due to different circumstances. We can talk about previous traumas due to which one now feels completely alone, estranged from others,” Malin Andersson explained.

According to the social services, most young people started with sites for “sugar dating”, where wealthy adults seek out younger partners for money.

“This implies a very big risk. People who are interested in children have already crossed the threshold, they don’t care what the child thinks. Also, they are very good at persuading,” Andersson said.

When the police and social services identify sex workers who are younger than 18, they are taken home to their parents and offered help and support.

“Now we see more active male users on sugar dating sites, and young people are more likely to post ads offering sexual services. All this is very serious, as we know: very often this kind of arrangement is a direct gateway to prostitution,” Stockholm City social affairs councillor Jan Jönsson said, pledging to address the matter.

Sweden's present-day legislation on prostitution make it illegal to buy sex, but not to sell it. Pimping and operating brothers is also illegal. It was Sweden that pioneered the criminalisation of the purchase, but not the selling of sex back in 1999. Since then the Nordic model has spread to other nations, including Canada and Ireland.

With 32,172 confirmed Covid-19 cases and close to 3,900 deaths, Sweden is the worst-hit Scandinavian nation.

Despite its no-lockdown strategy, Sweden's economy has taken a deep hit as consumption plummeted by over 24 percent since March.",fake
