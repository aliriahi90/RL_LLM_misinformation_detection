Known for participating in Chicago Air and Water shows, the pilot squadron’s surprise Tuesday flyover will honor front-line workers during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We salute and thank all healthcare workers, first responders and other essential personnel serving on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19,” a release said.

In a flight plan announced Monday, the planes will loop across the city — reaching suburbs as far west as Melrose Park and as far south as Oak Lawn — starting at 11:45 a.m., then fly down the Lake Michigan shoreline before departing the area at 12:00 p.m.

The Blue Angels will also be flying over Detroit and Indianapolis on Tuesday, making those two cities plus Chicago the latest stops on what has become a nationwide salute tour.

The jets flew over Dallas, Houston and New Orleans last week and had previously visited major East Coast cities like New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Miami.

The Blue Angels have represented the Navy and Marine Corps with ceremonial flyovers since 1946, according to their website.",real

About 38,000 immigrants are in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and several thousands more are being held at facilities near the country’s borders by Customs and Border Protection.

All of those immigrants are being held on civil matters — namely, entering or residing in the United States without proper authorization — and are either waiting for their day in immigration court or have already been ordered deported.

ICE and CPB should release immigrants who are awaiting to go in front of a judge and pose no threat to public safety to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the tight confines of detention centers, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.

“Thankfully, we’ve seen some judges order the release of a handful of vulnerable immigrants in custody. It also appears that ICE has been quietly releasing a few immigrants in some detention facilities, but this simply isn’t enough,” he said.

So far, there are four confirmed cases of COVID-19 among those in ICE custody along with five confirmed cases among ICE employees and personnel working in detention facilities. BuzzFeed News reports ICE is monitoring 63 detainees in 22 detention facilities.

Lawmakers suspect those numbers will rise dramatically as immigrants in detention facilities aren’t able to practice adequate social distancing.

“We’re calling on ICE to act now ... because we know that people will die if we don’t take action,” said Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.), who heads the caucus’ task force on immigration.

Detention centers are routinely criticized for not providing adequate medical care for immigrants. Ten immigrants have died while in ICE custody since October and seven children have died in CPB custody or shortly after being released, “many after receiving delayed medical care or being denied care altogether,” according to the ACLU.

“We know that detention centers do not have the sanitary conditions required to contain the potential outbreak of coronavirus inside their facilities,” said Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.).

Tania Linares Garcia, a senior attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said one of her clients — a young man who’s lived in Chicago for most of his life and is being held at a detention center in Wisconsin — suffers from anxiety “and really isn’t doing well right now.”

“There’s no way for him to protect himself — no access to gloves, masks, anything to keep his living quarters clean. He feels like a sitting duck.”

29,841,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/understanding_victor_orbns_purportedly_unlimited_emergency_powers_over_hungary.html,2020-05-13,Understanding Viktor Orbán’s Purportedly ‘Unlimited’ Emergency Powers over Hungary,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is one of the most controversial national leaders in the Western world. Just over a month ago, his majority Fidesz (Hungarian Civic Alliance) Party pushed through the “unlimited” emergency powers by a two-thirds majority of Parliament on March 30.

Orbán has been harshly criticized by the European Union for his firm stance in keeping (predominantly Muslim) refugees from entering Hungary ever since he closed the borders to them in 2015. Consequently, Orbán has been accused by the international community of being an Islamophobe, especially after he said: “Islam has never been part of Europe, it came to us. We in Hungary decide what we want or don't want. We don’t want that.”

What Orbán’s critics failed to mention is that Hungary, a country of just under 10 million, was ruled for over a century by the oppressive Islamic Turks and was always on the front line during the many centuries of hostility between Christian Europe and the Muslim Ottoman Empire invaders. The Hungarian Prime Minster has thus far been able to keep his country safe from Islamic terrorism compared to the United Kingdom, France and Germany, which took in large flows of illegal immigrants.

Yet the focus is Orbán’s emergency powers, now that Hungary is reopening after its lockdown. They entail the suspension of certain Parliamentary Acts, referendums and by-elections, giving Orbán the authority to rule by decree — something France’s Emmanuel Macron is doing unrelated to the coronavirus. The Act also calls for penal measures to be taken against anyone who “in front of a large audience, [willingly and deliberately] states or disseminates any untrue fact or any misrepresented true fact that is capable of hindering or preventing the efficiency of protection” against the coronavirus.

Naturally, all this has led to Orbán being classified as a dictator, even being compared to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping. Opposition figures have suggested that Fidesz will use the prospect of a coronavirus-induced recession to extend Orbán’s power indefinitely. Outside observers, in fact, equally warn of a dictatorship within the European Union’s borders.

István Kiss, former Hungarian official and member of the Danube Institute, dispels this contention. As he personally explained to me, there are in fact several clauses to the Act. The constitution that governs the “state of danger” says that when the danger, i.e., the epidemic, ends, government decrees made under the emergency become invalid. Also, the constitutional court could reject it in whole or in part, either today or after the epidemic has receded. Lastly, Parliament can vote to end the state of emergency at any time by a simple majority.

So far as the mandate of penalizing those who spread false information or for breaking a quarantine, the former is in full force in other parts of Europe, such as Italy, where I reside. In fact, the Hungarian Criminal Code introduced during the state of emergency is less harsh than in a lot of other countries, as for example in France or in the Philippines where the army and police have orders to shoot violators on site. Private communications or opinions, however critical they may be of the government, as well as speculations or forecasts, do not fall under the aforementioned sanction.

According to The American Conservative’s Rod Dreher, Orbán has been a tireless advocate of Hungarian national sovereignty. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Westerners came in and bought up what was left of Hungarian industry at fire sale prices. A big reason for Orbán’s popularity is that he realized that as long as the country’s economy is controlled, or at least strongly dominated, by foreigners, Hungarians do not control their destiny. Hence, he pulled the reins on those industries and placed them under Hungarian sovereignty. Despite Hungarians’ reservations of their Prime Minister’s cronyism, i.e., redistributing controlling interests in those industries to his own supporters, apparently the average citizen sees this, in contrast to foreign ownership, as the lesser of two evils.

This, incidentally, accounts for Orbán’s mistrust and contempt for those who seek to undermine his socio-political vision, such as his co-national George Soros. According to Dreher:

“This is something that Western liberals do not understand — or if they understand it, they don’t accept it. Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire, has poured a fortune into trying to turn Hungary and the other countries of the former Soviet bloc into Western-style liberal democracies…. The idea in part is to undermine traditional sources of moral authority in that country, to turn it, politically, into a Western-style [moral vacuum that would promote open borders, abortion, same-sex unions and the like].”

The physical manifestations of a pandemic are now nearly non-existent in Hungary — emergency rooms stand empty, entire villages have not reported a single COVID-19 case and almost no one has been hospitalized. Yet the paradox of Orbán’s purported Caesar-type takeover of government is that he maintains widespread domestic support since he is viewed to represent a politics that blends nationalism and values-traditionalism with economic modernity.

Part of this, especially with the demographic decline in his country before a rising Muslim population in Europe, has been the implementation of the Family Protection Plan, in which

• every woman under 40 years of age will be eligible to a preferential loan when they first get married;

• preferential loans for the family home purchase scheme will be extended; families raising two or more children will now also be able to use it for purchasing resale homes;

• families with two or more children will be repaid 1 million forints (roughly over 3,000 USD) of the mortgage loan;

• women who have had and raised at least four children will be exempt from personal income tax payment for the rest of their lives;

• grandparents will also be eligible to receive child-care fees and look after young children instead of the parents, the prime minister added.

I am an American who resides in Italy — where the EU has thus far done nothing for us here during the coronavirus pandemic — and believe in “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” While Orbán’s emergency powers to rule by decree can be seen as an excessive in United States, I can understand why he is supported by most of his fellow Hungarians, as well as many other Westerners, and opposed by both the European Union bureaucrats and the left-wing mainstream media.

“Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it,” he said today in a White House roundtable with restaurant executives. Trump said he’s been taking the drugs every day for a week and a half and that he has not had any COVID-19 symptoms. People close to the president, including one of Trump’s valets and Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, recently tested positive for the virus.

Side effects include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness

There is still no evidence that taking hydroxychloroquine can prevent someone from contracting or getting sick from the coronavirus. It’s a possibility — a number of research groups are running clinical trials to see if the drug could protect health care workers who are regularly exposed to the virus from getting sick — but no data from those studies is available yet.

Trump said he’s following the lead of frontline workers. “You look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative,” he said. While there are clinical trials looking specifically at using the drug as a preventive for health care workers, it is still not clear how many health care workers are taking the drug. Side effects of hydroxychloroquine include damage to part of the eye, life-threatening heart effects, and muscular weakness.

Trump spent weeks promoting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. His administration reportedly pushed the Food and Drug Administration and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to authorize the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside of the hospital, based on meager evidence. While early data showed that hydroxychloroquine may help some patients, additional studies found that it wasn’t effective and could have dangerous side effects, especially in people with severe symptoms. Trump stopped touting the drug after that data was publicized. In April, the FDA warned against the use of the drug for COVID-19 outside the hospital or a clinical trial.

While Trump says that he is taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, that can’t be independently verified. All the public has is his word, and neither he nor his White House have been reliable sources of information during this pandemic. Among other things, Trump has spent the pandemic publicly recommending treatment strategies for COVID-19 based on limited evidence. In late April, he appeared to suggest that Lysol injections could cure the disease. No therapies have been proven to effectively treat or prevent COVID-19.

At time of publication, more than 90,000 people in the United States have died of the disease.",real
37,1683,https://www.politico.eu/interactive/in-pictures-nhs-workers-fighting-to-keep-a-covid-19-ward-safe/,2020-05-21,In pictures: NHS workers fighting to keep a COVID-19 ward safe,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Normal speech sprays droplets with contagious coronavirus The thousands of tiny fluid droplets that we spray during normal conversation are a potentially significant way the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, according to a report on Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. ""There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,"" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (https://bit.ly/3fJIRqp)
Twin antibodies may be better than one Scientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a ""cocktail"" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (https://bit.ly/2WsbD7b)
Children with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kidsChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. ""It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,"" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. ""With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.""
Among children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. ""Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,"" Kung said. ""This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.""
(https://bit.ly/3cuDM3j)Scientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genomeResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. ""This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,"" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. ""The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes."" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https://bit.ly/3buhU6A)
Coronavirus particles in feces may not be infectiousThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

62,901,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rick-bright-whistleblower-hhs-testimony-house-of-representatives-coronavirus-research-today-2020-05-14/,2020-05-14,"Ousted virus expert Rick Bright warns of ""darkest winter in modern history""","Washington — Dr. Rick Bright, a top government virologist who filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was removed from his role for political reasons, told lawmakers on Thursday that ""time is running out"" to develop a nationwide strategy for combating the coronavirus pandemic and distributing an eventual vaccine.

""Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities,"" Bright told a House subcommittee Thursday morning. ""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.""

Bright, who remains a federal employee, testified Thursday before the Subcommittee on Health for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about the pandemic and the whistleblower complaint he filed about being removed from his job as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Bright claims that he was ousted from his position after raising concerns about a coronavirus treatment supported by President Trump.

In his prepared testimony, Bright said he believes his transfer came about as a result of his insistence that money allocated by Congress to confront COVID-19 should be put ""into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.""

""I spoke out then and I am testifying today because science — not politics or cronyism — must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,"" Bright said.

He also advocated ""clear leadership, honest communication, and data-driven solutions"" as the pandemic continues, and suggested increasing public education on health measures such as hand-washing and social distancing, as well as ramping up production of essential equipment and implementing a national testing system.

Whistleblower says Trump administration ignored warnings about coronavirus

Bright's whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, said he was removed as director of BARDA soon after the publication of an article about chloroquine for which Bright admits he was a source.

Government officials, he said in his complaint, ""refused to listen,"" so Bright opted to talk to a journalist. He said he believed that he had a moral obligation to do what he could to protect the public ""from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.""

The Department of Health and Human Services issued a lengthy statement attempting to rebut Bright's testimony in the form of a fact check.

The federal Office of Special Counsel last week determined his removal was retaliatory and said that Bright should be reinstated as director of BARDA while the matter is investigated.

Mr. Trump has referred to hydroxychloroquine as a potential ""game-changer"" in treating COVID-19 and has recommended the use of the antimalarial drug as a potential treatment, despite limited evidence of the drug's efficacy.

In mid-April, the Trump administration granted chloroquine an Emergency Use Authorization, an FDA authority that allows unapproved medical products to be used in medical emergencies. The FDA on April 24 cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine ""outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial.""

Bright claims his persistent warnings caused tension with his bosses at the Department of Health and Human Services. He says it reached a breaking point when he raised concerns over the administration's embrace of hydroxychloroquine, what Bright called a drug unproven to treat COVID-19 patients.

""You believe you were retaliated against because you raised concerns about hydroxychloroquine?"" CBS News' Norah O'Donnell asked Bright in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that will air May 17.

""Yes. I do,"" Bright replied.

Mr. Trump has said he doesn't know Bright, but he ""seems like a disgruntled employee who's trying to help the Democrats win an election.""

""I am not disgruntled,"" Bright told ""60 Minutes."" ""I am frustrated at a lack of leadership. I am frustrated at a lack of urgency to get a head start on developing life-saving tools for Americans. I'm frustrated at our inability to be heard as scientists.""

81,1938,https://theduran.com/us-militarizes-the-caribbean-sea-to-surround-venezuela/,2020-05-23,US militarizes the Caribbean Sea to surround Venezuela,"Submitted by InfoBrics, authored by Lucas Leiroz, research fellow in international law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro…

Recently, the number of American ships and planes in the Caribbean Sea has increased exponentially. The most likely hypothesis so far is that there will be an attempt to block Venezuela, as the military flow in the region began to grow only after Iran announced the sending of oil ships to the Bolivarian country. On May 14, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that the boats that take gasoline to Venezuelan ports are being persecuted by the American Navy, which is worsening with the arrival of Iranian ships. The White House has already reported that it has taken retaliation against this cooperation between Venezuelans and Iranians, but no further information has been provided on the military operations being carried out. The United States has announced sanctions against any company that participates in the supply of gasoline to Venezuela, which is causing a structural crisis of fuel scarcity in the South American country.

In addition to the blockade, there is a humanitarian issue, as American measures are inducing a major economic recession in the Bolivarian Republic. It has also been reported by the Venezuelan government that the tax imposed by the United States is affecting the country’s food supply, which is already having an effect on society. With a crisis and the siege being imposed on Caracas, how do Venezuelans use to deal with the advancing pandemic of new coronaviruses? How can the Bolivarian government manage a major economic and social crisis with imminent health danger? It is just the American strategy: to raise a siege and provoke the Venezuelan national collapse, inducing, through coercion, Nicolás Maduro’s government to accept changes in the regime for the benefit of Washington.

The naval blockade is just one of the measures the United States is taking to overthrow Nicolás Maduro’s legitimate government. A few days ago, an attempted invasion against the country, carried out by Colombian mercenaries on American speedboats, was neutralized, with several terrorists arrested. Apparently, the sea will be the path by which Washington will try to overthrow Maduro, insisting on the military operation as solution of international controversies. The case also indicates the presence of the so-called “extermination war”, an ancient warlike practice in which a country is surrounded and kept under block by the navy of another nation, preventing the arrival of goods and food in port areas, affecting the population as a whole, indirectly leading thousands of people to hunger, misery and death. Basically, this is exactly the American goal in Venezuela with the current blockade. Without formally declaring war, Washington adopts an even more insidious strategy than traditional military confrontation.

However, there is yet another important factor – and above Venezuela – behind the American interest in militarizing the Caribbean Sea. Since at least the First World War, the USA has occupied a position of undisputed supremacy on the seas, which allowed Washington, in time, to exercise a role of “global naval police”. However, this reality is changing day after day, since the world is already beginning to contemplate a response from nations to American naval power, especially in Asia.

In the Asian continent, China and Iran are challenging the American Navy. In China, the progress of the Navy is absolute, with the Chinese having already succeeded, for the first time in its history, to overcome the International Date Line and concluding military tests in spaces traditionally occupied by the American maritime forces. In Iran, the maneuvering of small vessels against large American ships is daring. Recently, some sources have informed that Tehran will produce nuclear submarines, with the aim of increasing its naval power.

The United States has spoken out several times condemning its opponents in China and Iran, but nothing has been done other than the mere war of words. In practice, it is difficult to deny that the United States has a naval power today that is much less powerful than it was decades ago. Washington did not attack its rivals in Asia simply because it could not handle a counteroffensive from Beijing or Tehran – at least not without a big material loss as a result.

All of these factors are contributing to a redirection of the American Navy’s strategic policies. No longer able to keep its global power intact, Washington manages its forces for the southern portions of the American continent itself, guaranteeing a regional space of power. However, in the Americas the opposition to US possible aggression will be fierce and will have international support from other continents.

The coronavirus pandemic has left many homebound and unable to attend school or work, so having access to professional tools that cost hundreds of dollars during this time is a big deal. “We hope customers who are home and looking for something new to master will try out these free trials,” reads Apple’s announcement.

Final Cut Pro X already had a 30-day free trial, but a free trial of any kind is entirely new for Logic Pro X. Apple doesn’t mention when the offer for 90-day trials will end, but notes that both programs will revert to a 30-day free trial once the initiative expires. Additionally, customers who have already downloaded the 30-day free trial of Final Cut Pro X will be able to take advantage of the extended trial period.

Other companies that make music software are handing out similar free deals amid the pandemic. Avid is issuing a limited number of free 90-day licenses for Pro Tools, for example, and Fender is giving 100,000 people three months of free guitar lessons on its Fender Play app.

For those looking to purchase the software after the trial period, Final Cut Pro X costs $299.99, and Logic Pro X costs $199.99.",real
86,1439,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/19/cdc-reforms-coronavirus/,2020-05-19,Reform the CDC to fight the next pandemic,"The men and women at the CDC are some of the most well-trained and dedicated civil servants in the country. But even those of us who have been cheerleaders for the CDC’s role in keeping the United States and the world safe recognize the need for fixing this venerable institution.

It is reasonable to ask why the CDC was unable to quickly develop and scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus’s official name. Why was there no backup plan? How come SARS-CoV-2 circulation in many parts of the United States remained undetected by the CDC’s early warning systems for at least several weeks after January? Why did the CDC not take the lead in developing, or at least systematically collating, projection models for the pandemic’s spread, which would have decreased confusion among decision-makers and the public?





If we want to avoid asking similar questions again the next time a new virus appears, the CDC needs some changes.

Over the years, there has been a substantial expansion in the types of activities the CDC is involved with. The federal agency whose original name was the Communicable Disease Center now deals with issues ranging from birth defects to injury prevention. Critics have charged that this expanded focus has resulted in dilution of the CDC’s outbreak response mission. The CDC should not ignore other health issues such as obesity and noncommunicable diseases. But it cannot afford to lose focus as the nation’s insurance policy against infectious disease threats.

Reform efforts should focus on increasing CDC’s infectious disease laboratory capacity and enhancing its expertise in scaling up testing during public health emergencies. One of the most effective ways to get ahead of outbreaks is to have a highly sensitive epidemiological surveillance system. CDC maintains several surveillance systems, but they were of limited utility as early warning systems for covid-19. CDC will have to reassess the data it acquires, how fast these data get transmitted and what analytical tools it uses to detect signals. CDC will also have to modernize the types of data it routinely uses. For example, rapidly sequencing and analyzing genomes of circulating viruses can provide important information, such as where the virus was imported from. To better prepare for fast-spreading outbreaks, CDC will have to expand the use of genomic epidemiology and other modern tools for surveillance.





The CDC also badly needs more money, and Congress has to change the way it funds the agency. Public health investments yield very high returns: For every dollar spent on prevention, there is a five times return on investment within five years. Despite this, Congress has tried to fund public health on the cheap. As a result, the CDC has been chronically underresourced. For example, CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program that supports states and local areas in their preparations for pandemics and other emergencies has had its funding shrunk from $940 million in 2002 to $675 million in 2020. PHEP funds can be used to develop laboratory and contact-tracing capacity — which could have come in handy in this pandemic.

CDC’s programs are micromanaged by Congress through detailed line-item budgeting, which means lawmakers and their aides have undue influence over CDC priorities. A stroll through the CDC campus can be illustrative: You arrive at the (Rep. Edward R.) Roybal campus to check in at the (Sen.) Tom Harkin communications center to walk to the (Sen.) Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center. The instinct to appease political leadership was criticized by the National Academy of Sciences during another infectious disease emergency — the smallpox bioterrorism threat in 2005. A nimble, evidence-driven CDC would require flexibility in resource allocation based on scientific acumen and experience of public health professionals, rather than ideological leanings of vested interests.

The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), CDC’s flagship training program for its staff, needs to be modernized. This postdoctoral program trains CDC scientists in epidemiologic field work through a combination of classroom training and experiential learning. Career CDC leaders usually come from this cadre of staff; it is rare for a non-EIS-trained CDC staff to rise to the senior echelons.





EIS officers are trained in conventional methods for investigating and responding to outbreaks, such as fast-paced studies that compare exposures among those with illness labeled as “cases” and those without disease labeled as “controls.”

But the science of disease control has evolved substantially and now includes tools such as advanced mathematical modeling, genomic epidemiology and high-end laboratory methods. CDC does employ scientists with expertise in these and other emerging subfields. These skills are increasingly so seminal to modern disease control approaches, though, that they should be a major part of the core EIS training requirements. Moreover, EIS officers should be well-versed in the science of behavioral interventions — designing a smart social distancing strategy is as much about human behavior as it is about biological characteristics of the virus.

Just over a year ago in a U.S. Senate committee hearing, I was asked about the value of the CDC. Without hesitation, I described the CDC as a national treasure. I continue to believe this. And it is precisely because I have such faith in the abilities of the men and women of the CDC that I know we must reform this U.S. institution of global significance. We need it to be as excellent as it can be.

89,1075,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-qatar-spreads-exponentially-in-migrant-worker-labor-camps/,2020-05-15,"Coronavirus spreads ""exponentially"" in Qatar's labor camps","Amman — On normal days, the tiny, gas-rich nation of Qatar looks like a giant construction site. Dozens of hotels and sports stadiums are being constructed, along with a world-class transportation infrastructure that includes a 47-mile metro system and miles of brand new roads. Most of these massive projects were scheduled to be finished in time for the 2022 Football World Cup, which Qatar was controversially awarded to host.

Qatar sits on one of the world's biggest natural gas reserves, so securing financing for the projects was never an issue. The biggest challenge was acquiring the manpower to build and oversee all the work. Like most of its neighbors, Qatar is heavily dependent on foreign labor, mainly workers from Asian and East African countries.

Diplomatic disputes will not stop plans for 2022 FIFA World Cup

Less than 10% of Qatar's nearly 2.5 million inhabitants are Qatari nationals. About 600,000 blue-collar workers, mostly young, single non-Qatari men, labor away to build Qatar's legacy.

In color-coded uniforms, the workers are bussed onto the construction sites in the morning. In the afternoon the laborers are delivered back to huge camps, built specifically to house them, on the outskirts of the capital, Doha.

The labor camps have long been criticized by human rights groups for overcrowding and poor living conditions. Now, according to a health expert with the World Bank, due to those conditions, ""this is fertile ground for transmission of COVID-19.""

""The increase was relatively slow in the first few weeks. Then it started to rise almost exponentially from one week to another,"" Dr. Sameh El-Saharty, Lead Health Specialist at The World Bank, said recently at the Brookings Doha Center. ""These transmissions were mainly among migrant workers, and for obvious reasons.""

Since Qatar's first few cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in March, the numbers have mushroomed to almost 29,000 in less than two months. The cases have spread across all of Qatar's population, and while officials don't give precise breakdowns of where they are, it's clear many are inside the labor camps.

Authorities moved fast to contain the spreading virus by locking down the country and isolating the entire industrial area where the laborers live.

An official from the Qatari Government Communications Office told CBS News the country has, ""implemented wide-ranging containment and prevention measures [and] curtailed all social activity, closed parks and recreation facilities, shuttered mosques and other religious places of worship, and closed shops and restaurants.""

From Sunday, it will also be mandatory for everyone in Qatar to wear face coverings when out in public - enforced by a possible fine up to $53,000.

More than 11,000 hospital beds were set aside for COVID-19 patients and over 30 hotels blocked off by the government to use as quarantine facilities.

""Qatar's priority is the health, safety, and wellbeing of our population,"" the official told CBS News, adding that, ""anyone who tests positive for coronavirus immediately receives high-quality medical treatment at no cost.""

The robust health care system, and the fact that such a high proportion of the people in Qatar are young, relatively healthy laborers to begin with, has likely helped keep the confirmed COVID-19 death toll down to only 14 - considerably lower than other countries with similar case numbers.

The government is also trying to keep Qatar's economy healthy. It's providing ""financial support to businesses through an $824 million fund, so that salaries continue to be paid on time.""

The International Monetary Fund has forecasted that Qatar will be one of the few countries in the world to escape a recession in 2020.

Though the GCO official insisted that Qatar, ""is well-equipped to weather the economic impact of COVID-19,"" some major sectors will inevitably take a hit.

Qatar Airways announced this week that it will cut nearly 9,000 jobs as the coronavirus crisis keeps demand for air travel low. The airline's CEO told the BBC in an interview: ""It's a very hard decision… but we have no alternative.""

Work on Qatar's infrastructure projects, meanwhile, continues - but at a much slower pace with many projects frozen. That means many of the foreign laborers are left to bide their time - on the ""fertile ground"" of the camps.",real

A very disturbing video circulated on social media on Thursday showing a black Michigan man beating an elderly white man at a nursing home.

Jaydon Hayden, reportedly from Westland, Michigan filmed himself beating elderly white nursing home patients for sport.

The man filmed himself beating the the elderly man, later identified as a 75-year-old veteran, in his bed until he was bleeding.

On Friday FOX 2 Detroit in Michigan spoke with the father of the Jaydon Hayden after his arrest.

The father said his son is not vicious, but that he just has mental health issues.

And the father then said this,

“He said his son called 911 and was taken to a mental health facility in Ann Arbor. Last Wednesday, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and said he was supposed to be taken to another facility to be quarantined. The father added, “It should’ve never happened because he should’ve never been put in that environment.”

Did you catch that?

Authorities — following the orders of Governor Gretchen Whitmer — moved the young man to a nursing home to recover from COVID-19.

They moved 20-year-old Jaydon Hayden to the nursing home just last week.

According to his father, Jaydon Hayden was moved to the nursing home because he had COVID-19.

This tells us that Governor Whitmer is STILL sending COVID-19 patients to NURSING HOMES.

Michigan has 5,158 recorded coronavirus deaths.

And Democrat Governor Whitmer is STILL sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes!

So not only was Jayden BEATING nursing home patients but he was spreading the coronavirus in the same nursing home!

The Attorney for the Westwood Nursing Center told reporters the nursing home was not aware of the beating until they saw the video?

This was despite blood on the sheets and despite a patient with obvious facial damage!

And there’s more…

According to WXYZ.com the 75-year-old victim is a US veteran.

And according to WXYZ Jaydon was moved the hospital last Wednesday. The assault on the elderly man took place LAST FRIDAY!

And police did not arrest Jaydon until yesterday — a week later — at that same nursing home!

Jaydon Hayden beat the hell out of the seniors and was still in the facility a week later!

And now there is video of Jaydon, with COVID-19, in another woman’s room beating the hell out of her too.

Jaydon also posted this video online.

The document, a May 13 daily interagency update on the nation’s coronavirus response circulated by the Department of Homeland Security, notes new areas of concern for coronavirus. It was provided to Yahoo News by one of its recipients under the condition that that recipient not be identified.

“As most states have begun phased re-opening, several COVID-19 hot spots continue to emerge,” the notice says. Three counties are then listed: Palm Beach; San Bernardino County, Calif.; and Marshall County, Ala.

“Palm Beach County, FL reported a 71% increase in new cases the last 7 days compared to the previous 7 days,” the document explains. “The state authorized Palm Beach County to begin Phase 1 of reopening on 11 May, which includes the reopening of barbershops, salons, restaurants, and other businesses.”

President Trump recently changed his primary residence from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago golf resort, which is located in Palm Beach County.

The information in the document is attributed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and was collected on May 12, which means cases were rising even before the county began to reopen on May 11. Other parts of the state had begun to reopen earlier, on May 4.

Neither FEMA nor the DHS responded immediately to a request for comment.

The DHS document says that San Bernardino County in California “reported an increase of 782 cases in the last 7 days, nearly doubling new cases reported in the previous 7 days. County officials recently began Phase II of the county’s reopening plan, lifting requirements for mask use on 8 May.”

Marshall County, Ala., the document says, “reported 217 cases in the last 7 days, a 517% increase over the previous 7 days. Marshall County is home to several poultry plants and the meat packing industry accounts for 8% of the county’s employment. On 11 May, additional businesses were reopened.”

Public health officials have warned that lifting stay-at-home orders would lead to more infections and, inevitably, more deaths. Some governors have either discounted or dismissed such warnings, as has President Trump.

Encompassing the beachfront and inland communities north of Miami, Palm Beach County has a population density about four times that of Marshall County, which is in the northeastern corner of Alabama, and seven times that of San Bernardino County, which encompasses the desert region east of Los Angeles. Population density is thought to contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the lung disease known as COVID-19. That disease has killed more than 87,000 Americans, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The coronavirus also tends to strike older people. The average age of a Palm Beach County resident is 45 years old, whereas the average Marshall County resident is 39 years old and the San Bernardino County resident is only 33 years old.

Palm Beach is home to many retirement communities, a fact that worries health officials. The county has recorded 263 coronavirus deaths, three more than the entirety of South Korea, which recorded its first coronavirus case on the same late January day as the United States.",real

Massachusetts, praised by public health officials for being one of the first states to set up a coronavirus contact tracing program, is running into a problem: people aren’t picking up their phones.

When investigators reached out to infected residents and those with whom they came into close contact, more than half of their calls were being ignored, health officials revealed in recent a press briefing with Gov. Charlie Baker.

“If you get a call or a text from your local board of health or the COVID Team, it’s vital you take that call,” Baker said at the May 7 news conference, though state officials said the numbers have since improved.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her state has faced the same problem.

""I know a lot of you don't answer the phone when you see an unknown caller reaching in, but I implore you to answer the call if it comes,"" she said at an April 20 news conference.

Experts have long said that along with robust coronavirus testing, contact tracing -- the detective work of searching backward from a positive coronavirus case for everyone who might've been exposed to it -- on a massive scale is key to a safer reopening of the country.

Starting with people who test positive for COVID-19, tracers, with a series of carefully worded questions, figure out who a person was in contact with a few days before their symptoms started – skillfully reconstructing their schedules from sometimes hazy memories to map out a detailed chain of potential COVID-19 transmission.

They then follow up with that person's close contacts, alerting those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, all without ever revealing the identity of patient zero.

But across the country, the growing number of coronavirus contact tracers are struggling to reach some residents who may have been exposed and, therefore, could be spreading the disease, public health officials in several states told ABC News.

While it’s not clear how many Americans are ignoring contact tracing calls – a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said the agency is not gathering data on the subject from the states – any spike in missed connections could delay efforts to quickly notify people and limit the spread of the virus in communities beginning to loosen restrictions, public health officials and experts told ABC News.

“When you miss anyone, and your contact tracing is incomplete, then you are at risk of ongoing transmission,” said Capt. Eric Pevzner, the chief of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the country’s premier public health investigation program.

In interviews with ABC News, health officials offered a variety of explanations for why people aren’t answering phone calls from contact tracers, from robocall fatigue to concerns over privacy to a general mistrust of the system.

“It’s a trend we need to watch,” said Dr. Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in light of the “truly unprecedented” scale of contact tracing being done.

“It’s going to take a really impressive amount of cooperation and buy-in from the public to do this,” she said.

A consequence of endless robocalls

At a time when Americans are bombarded with more than 58 billion robocalls a year, and fraudsters are using the coronavirus to target potential victims in phone calls and text messages, many people are reluctant to field unexpected calls from unknown numbers.

“We’re hearing more and more from local health departments that have ramped up contact tracing, if citizens, if community members are seeing the Health Department on their phone, they’re really reluctant to provide information,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents nearly 3,000 local health departments across the country.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, local health officials performing contact tracing to track down food-borne illness and sexually transmitted disease outbreaks would be responsible for placing calls.

But with many states partnering with private companies and nonprofits to expand their coronavirus contact tracing efforts, some calls are being made from numbers that trace back to local health departments -- meaning the people who may already have been reluctant to answer are more likely to assume it's a robocall, a telemarketer or some other kind of sales pitch.

“We’re in a time in the United States when there’s a ton of spam phone calls,” John Welch of Partners in Health, the nonprofit working with the state on their contact tracing program, said at the press conference with Baker last week. “If they are worried about a scam, have folks call us back.”

To address the problem, Massachusetts is working with telephone companies to make sure their contact tracers are identified as “MA COVID TEAM” on any call in hopes the more official-sounding identification will convince people the call is legitimate.

The state has also launched a public service announcement campaign to promote the effort help residents understand what to expect from a potential phone call.

State health officials told ABC News Friday the outreach, along with some new tracing communication strategies, has recently brought their ""connection rates"" to above 60%, including 67.9% for May 11. The officials said that through the middle of the week, the state's effort has reached more than 34,000 people -- 18,936 confirmed cases and 15,889 of their contacts.

Some communities wary of giving health investigators personal info

But even if the recipient recognizes a legitimate government entity, sometimes that's a problem too. In some communities, contact-tracing response rates also appear to reflect larger concerns about what health authorities could do with the information they're given.

“In general, people are wary of sharing personal information with strangers or with people from government,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.

“Many of the groups that are being hardest hit -- black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans -- have had poor experiences with government officials and many have had poor experience with public health,” said Besser, who also previously served as chief health and medical editor for ABC News.

Freeman, who is in contact with hundreds of counties conducting contact tracing each day, said that communities with large immigrant populations have struggled in some cases to reach undocumented immigrants who have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.

“Because of some of the fear created already in our country around immigration and legal status, there are some we simply will never reach because they’re fearful that the information will be used to somehow track them"" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told ABC News.

In Maryland’s Anne Arundel County outside of Baltimore, public health workers have made community outreach a priority in their contact tracing by adding translators to their staff, and making sure all their informational handouts are available in Spanish.

The county has also increased outreach to African-American and Hispanic community leaders, to help encourage residents to participate, according to Jennifer Schneider, the deputy director of the health department’s bureau of disease prevention and management.

“There is some mistrust, and we battle with that in public health in general, for the communities to trust the government,” she said. “Immigration status is not a requirement for being tested. We just try to get that messaging out as much as we can and often.”

While the county, which has over 2,500 cases of COVID-19, says it has reached roughly 95% of traced contacts, Schneider said they are concerned about that figure rising as the state begins to ease out of its lock-down, and residents begin interacting with more people.

“We may have to pivot our operations to better find those individuals. That is a concern that we do have,” she said.

The emerging role of technology

In some parts of the country, local public health officials are using technology to reach residents who favor other forms of communication over phone calls.

In Chicago, the city launched Chi COVID Coach to allow the health department to communicate directly with Chicago residents via text message, and provide them with resources on testing and symptoms.

“Let’s not make the choice between tech and people, we need both,” Raed Mansour, Director of Innovation at the Chicago Department of Public Health, told ABC News. “In contact tracing, you need to meet people where they are.”

In many places, that has included text messaging for those who are less likely to answer calls.

""Texting is another way we are letting people know they are trying to reach them,"" Pevznar, the CDC official, told ABC News.""We find people tend to be more receptive to text. Text is a valuable tool.""

Perhaps most importantly, however, experts also urged for a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to participate.

That effort could help address problems some tracers have faced when they finally do successfully get in touch with people.

One of the newer unexpected problems some tracers are seeing is nearly an existential one: a lost sense of time.

Some people have struggled to piece together their schedules, after weeks of stay-at-home orders in certain regions, public health officials told ABC News.

Since your life has been disrupted, you don’t have those things to pin your memory to. People’s days tend to blend together,” said Pevznar.

Then, there are those who make contact tracing exponentially difficult by flouting quarantine measures. Sara Bosse, the health director in California’s rural Madera County, said that her team has checked in on asymptomatic residents infected with COVID-19 who have stopped complying with stay-at-home restrictions.

“As the weather has gotten warmer, we’ve noticed that people want to be outside and go places and do things,” she told ABC News.

Dr. Philip Huang, the director of the Health and Human Services department in Dallas County, Texas, said it's important to get people to understand why they need to isolate and self-quarantine if contacted, even if they don't have symptoms.

""People need to be responsible. It’s actually caring for the community and caring for others – it may be someone's mother or someone’s grandmother,"" he said. ""It does affect us all.""

Press TV, Gaza



Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have celebrated the first day of Eid al-Fitr holidays which mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

People attended the morning prayers of Eid Al Fitr at mosques that have reopened recently. Worshippers attended the prayers while taking the necessary precautionary measures.

Palestinians are celebrating Eid Al Fitr holiday differently this year due to worldwide coronavirus. However, people here say this won't prevent them from congratulating their families and celebrating Al Eid while following the instructions.

People in Gaza usually take the opportunity of Eid al-Fitr to wear new clothes, visit relatives, distribute sweets and traditional cookies. In this year however, they limited themselves to congratulating each other on the happy occasion.

Gaza, with a population of nearly two million has not been affected badly by the new coronavirus. Only one death from COVID-19 has been reported so far. People in Gaza say closure of mosques were unprecedented by they appreciate authorities for doing so to protect the lives of people.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Gaza has been on the edge. This is because the medical sector in the besieged enclave was already on the verge of collapse before the virus hit the territory.",fake

Opinion contributor

If you’re concerned your children are falling behind with remote learning, don’t worry! I’m here to pass on some virtually valuable lessons I’ve learned from my kid’s Zoom class, one room over:

When in doubt, mute yourself.

Sock puppets are an excellent way to make your point.

Try at least to wear pants.

If you can’t think of anything to say, just try, “Thank you for sharing.”

Good lighting is key, even if you have the complexion of a 5-year-old.

Waiting to be called on, patiently, with your hand in the air, can suck your soul.

Sucking your thumb while others talk counts as a legitimate listening face.

Showing up to Morning Meeting with your hair French-braided and accessorized with a bow is a bit too extra for a pandemic.

Someone who teaches ""mindfulness"" is too in the moment to remember her students’ names.

Making the most of quarantine:From robots to 3D printing, how coronavirus can inspire waves of innovation

When you finally get called on, and you can’t remember anymore what you were going to say, just talk about anything Harry Potter or how your mom doesn’t want you staring at a screen all day.

During Morning Weather Report, try not to complain that the weather at your Cape Cod beach house is chillier than the weather being experienced by your friends whose parents are essential workers.

Indoor tepees full of stuffed animals make excellent “designated work spaces.”

It is good for lessons to be interrupted by pets and cute siblings.

Using jellybeans to solve “number stories” is very effective, particularly when it comes to eating them for subtraction problems.

When it comes to expressing yourself during virtual arts and crafts time, it is helpful to chant while squeezing glue, “Dot, dot, not a lot.”

When discussing wants and needs, remember that trampolines and unicorns, as necessary as they seem, qualify as “wants.”

How to get teens to heed the warnings:Why are young people so bad at coronavirus social distancing? Blame their brains.

Nobody needs to hear that your dad farted during dinner last night.

Nobody needs to see your mom in her jog bra behind you during Word Work.

People who keep interrupting end up in the Waiting Room.

You don’t have to announce to everyone that you need to go to the bathroom.

You don’t have to take your Zoom meeting with you to the bathroom.

“Namaste” is a nice way to greet your friends.

Don’t pretend you have a question when it’s really a comment — you won’t fool anyone.

You don’t have to announce to everyone that you’ve returned from the bathroom.

If you are sheltering at your country house in the Hamptons, ask your essential gardener to turn off the leaf blower during Story Time.

123,621,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21222019/space-industry-coronavirus-pandemic-finance-government-contracts,2020-05-05,How the space industry is weathering the coronavirus pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a sledgehammer to the economy — and the space industry is no exception. While some major space companies are still in operation, considered essential by the US government, smaller startups are grappling with how to move forward as once-reliable funding sources evaporate.

Before the pandemic, the global space industry was really coming into its stride, valued at around $360 billion, according to one analysis. In the US, an eclectic mix of major players and smaller startups comprise this sector, pursuing established markets like building rockets and satellites as well as more niche services like creating space habitats, mining the Moon, and manufacturing in space. For the last few years, space startups with bold ideas could successfully close round after round of funding.

“venture capital firms are pausing on their new investments.”

Now, companies may have a hard time getting infusions from outside investors. “Normally, you have capital to help [companies] continue to grow,” Carissa Christensen, founder and CEO of Bryce Space and Technology, a space analytics and engineering firm, tells The Verge. “You assume that they would be able to find other investors as well, and then you’d be looking for a new deal. Now, in this environment, where it’s unclear how companies are going to be affected by the situation, venture capital firms are pausing on their new investments, and preserving their capital.”

That means companies will likely rely on government contracts — either from NASA or the Department of Defense — now more than ever as a guaranteed source of funding. “A lot of these companies have the government as part of their revenue stream —some of it, the majority of their revenue stream,” Chad Anderson, CEO of angel investment and venture capital firm Space Angels, tells The Verge. “Most space companies have some government money coming in, and the government money is not drying up.”

A few high-profile space companies succumbed at the start of the pandemic. Bigelow Aerospace, which aims to build habitats and hotels in space, laid off all of its employees in late March, blaming orders from the governor of Nevada to close all nonessential businesses. “If we didn’t [close], we would be subject to fines, penalties, and the threat of having our business license revoked,” a spokesperson for Bigelow told The Verge at the time. Internet-from-space provider OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in late March, just after launching its latest batch of internet-providing satellites.

Analysts say these early losses are likely the result of problems that companies had before the pandemic, and the economic downturn just amplified those issues. “There were underlying problems before the virus,” Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, tells The Verge. “With OneWeb, it wasn’t corona that took them out. It was the fact that they needed to find $500 million more. It may have been that the virus exacerbated that a little bit or accelerated it.” Bigelow had been vying for government contracts from NASA, but the company had mostly been self-funded. OneWeb also turned to the UK government after an expected investment from its backer SoftBank fell through.

“The companies that are highly capital intensive are going to struggle.”

“The companies that are highly capital intensive are going to struggle, because capital is scarce right now,” says Anderson. “The companies that are profitable, or have found novel, low-cost ways to do things in new ways — or if they’re focused on minimizing costs and focusing on the business model — those companies are going to fare better.”

Some aerospace startups are still figuring out where to focus their attention in this new reality. California-based Rocket Lab put its launches on pause in New Zealand to keep its personnel safe. Relativity Space, which is making a completely 3D-printed rocket, says it is doing well during the pandemic but that there will be a delay in testing its hardware. One startup launch provider, Astra, laid off a couple dozen employees to help survive the pandemic, according to a report from CNBC.

Many smaller space companies are looking for ways to get financial assistance from the government, as they run on tight margins. Some are less than a few years old and employ only 100 or so people, according to Stallmer. But unlike other small businesses, they don’t qualify for government assistance. Many of the venture-backed space startups are disqualified from receiving funds through the CARES Act, which is set up to help small businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. There is a stipulation in the law that associates any venture-backed company with the venture capital firm they receive funds from, pushing many of these small firms over the 500-employee limit to get loans through CARES. The CSF wrote a joint letter with other organizations to the Department of the Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Small Business Administration urging them to change this affiliation rule.

The government is providing a different kind of lifeline to some of the major launch providers and satellite firms. Armed with government contracts, these companies are considered “essential businesses,” allowing them to operate more or less like normal. Launch providers like ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin hold multiple contracts with NASA and the Defense Department, allowing them to continue work to maintain their launch capabilities. This “essential” status has been extended to numerous aerospace companies working on government missions. “About 50 percent of our portfolio has been deemed critical infrastructure or an essential service,” Anderson says. “So they have some level of operations that are continuing.”

Many companies longed to have the government as a customer well before there was a pandemic. The government often has bigger pockets than venture capitalists, and early investments from the public sector can be critical for fledgling space companies. SpaceX, for instance, received early government contracts during its first decade of operation that helped the company survive and then thrive, according to a report from Space Angels.

“I would say that existing government programs, contracts, and activities should be relatively stable.”

“I would say that existing government programs, contracts, and activities should be relatively stable,” says Christensen. “Even with the expense of responding to the pandemic, I think there’s going to be some real caution about the economic consequences of abruptly ending government programs.”

The government is still awarding contracts. Last week, NASA awarded three companies — SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Dynetics — contracts to develop landers to take humans to the Moon. Those contracts will last for 10 months, until February 2021, when NASA selects which companies it wants to actually build and do demonstrations with the landers. “Anybody that’s able to jump in and help with that liquidity gap right now is it a lifeline,” says Anderson. “And so the government is acting as that.”

Despite having the government as a customer, more established companies aren’t immune from the effects of the pandemic. “Hypothetically, if their suppliers for their fuel valves or fuel pumps go under because they can’t get enough orders, then that’s gonna have a ripple effect on them,” says Stallmer, potentially making it harder for companies to continue operating and manufacturing on schedule and at the same prices they’re used to.

In the meantime, some space companies are keeping busy by pitching in with the pandemic response. Companies like Planet, Maxar, and more have been providing crucial Earth imaging with their satellites to establish global trends and how the pandemic is affecting people’s movement around the world. Other satellites are being used to provide much need communications and connectivity options, helping doctors perform telehealth visits in rural areas.

Whether they’re keeping busy or just trying to keep the lights on, companies across the industry are all stuck in the same pandemic-induced holding pattern. Like many industries, it’s still too early to say what will happen in the future. But for smaller companies with loftier ambitions, the financial picture has already shifted. To make it through, they’ll have to tighten their belts and adjust their plans or scramble for a government-funded lifeline that keeps their unique space goals alive.",real

By Thursday, the county assumed the ominous moniker of having the most COVID-19 cases of any county in the United States with 58,457.

But Gov. J.B. Pritzker, facing daily criticisms from Republican legislators and the more than a million Illinoisans who are unemployed during the pandemic, signaled some hope for the Northeast region of his reopening plan, which includes Cook, the collar counties — and counties that aren’t too happy to be in that region, including Grundee and Kankakee.

For the first time on Thursday, the state’s Northeast region met the medical benchmarks set by the Pritzker administration to potentially move from the second phase of the reopening plan to the third phase. That would allow some additional businesses to resume operations on a limited basis when the current stay-at-home order expires May 29.

Those metrics include a 19.9% testing positivity rate for the Northeast region, just barely hitting the 20% standard required by Pritzker’s office over a two-week period.

“Remember, they need to go through a time period, and there needs to be an averaging of those metrics,” Pritzker said.

All other regions previously had been on track to enter the third phase and are still in line to do so.

Meanwhile, health officials said another 138 people have died of COVID-19 in Illinois, raising the state’s death toll to 3,928. And newly reported 3,239 cases are among the 22,678 test results received by the state a day earlier.

In total, there have been 87,937 coronavirus cases confirmed in 99 of Illinois’ 102 counties since the pandemic hit the state.

More than 512,000 people have been tested overall, with the state’s rolling positive rate over the last week at about 17%, officials said.

With the latest cases reported on Thursday, Cook County overtook Queens County, New York, which reported 58,084 as of Thursday, according to data kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Cook County added 2,051 cases over the last 24 hours compared to 336 for Queens, which has fewer than half the number of residents compared to Cook County but a much higher population density.

But Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike called the increase in cases “a function of increasing our testing.

“No one has captured all cases of COVID-19 — they have captured all cases for which people have been tested,” Ezike said. “This is getting us closer to the actual numbers, but we’re far, far, far from having the actual numbers.”",real

Early on, Bay Area cities adopted social distancing restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Health officials are optimistic about what they see so far — unlike in New York City.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

Social distancing, flattening the curve - they are phrases that a month ago didn't mean that much to most Americans. Now we hear them multiple times each day. Is social distancing working? When will the curve begin to flatten? They're questions that are asked over and over by officials, journalists, all of us living through this pandemic. We are going to spend the next several minutes trying to answer those questions about two parts of the country where the curve seems to be progressing very differently - California and New York. I'm joined now by NPR's Rebecca Hersher and John Ruwitch.

Welcome, you two.

JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: Hello.

REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hello.

KELLY: Hi, so, Becky, you first. We keep hearing in New York the curve is going up and up and up. Is that holding true today?

HERSHER: Yes, we're seeing a lot of coronavirus cases in New York. Nearly 50,000 people have tested positive. Nearly 2,000 people have died in the city. Hospitals are full of people with severe cases of COVID-19. Some doctors and nurses are starting to get sick. And as the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said today, New York is still climbing the mountain.

KELLY: John, where you are in California, the curve is also going up but not quite so dramatically.

RUWITCH: Yeah. That's right. I mean, so far, California is not experiencing anything like what's happening in New York. The caseload here is a fraction of New York's today. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, announced that there were just over 8,100 confirmed cases in the state. And it's America's biggest state - right? - with about 40 million people. One thing to note is that California has been behind New York in terms of testing, so we don't really have the full picture. But experts and the government here are keeping track of hospitalizations and numbers of people in ICUs as sort of the key indicators. And those numbers are lower than New York's, too.

KELLY: And where you are in California, the Bay Area specifically, was one of the earliest parts of the country to issue a shelter-in-place order. So let me get to the why question. Is that early shelter-in-place order one possible reason why cases there seem to be progressing more slowly?

RUWITCH: Yeah. Doctors I've talked to here think the shelter in place has potentially been a big part of it. People here have certainly been taking it seriously - and it's worth noting - for over two weeks now, which is the outer limit of what people think the incubation period is for this virus. I'm in a town about 30, 40 minutes south of San Francisco. I'm on the balcony now, actually, overlooking the southern part of the San Francisco Bay. And this is anecdotal, but the visibility has been great over this - during this shelter-in-place period. But also, the 280 freeway, which is a major artery between San Jose and San Francisco, has had noticeably less cars on it.

I spoke with George Rutherford. He's a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics here at Stanford. He says things could look a lot worse here for sure, but there's just not enough data yet to say that we're out of the woods. Here's what he had to say.

GEORGE RUTHERFORD: Preliminary, very preliminary indications are that things seem like they're going in the right direction. But it could all change quickly, and we want to make sure everybody keeps doing what they've been doing.

RUWITCH: To that end, the counties and cities around the Bay Area here have just extended shelter in place through early May.

KELLY: All right. I'm going to try to suppress my jealousy at the view you are enjoying there looking out over the ocean. The view, at least, sounds really good. Becky, let me flip back to you and ask about what is driving the trajectory there in New York, which is also under stay-at-home orders. So how does that factor in?

HERSHER: Yeah. New York did issue its stay-at-home order slightly later than California and especially almost a week later than the Bay Area. And that may matter. It's too soon to know, though. What epidemiologists have told me about what's happening in New York - what's definitely important that we already know is important is the density. So you can just imagine people are living in buildings with a lot of other people, right? New York City, Manhattan, even the outer boroughs - they're extremely dense. And there's a huge reliance on mass transit.

So people - they're packed closer together. They're sharing more surfaces - elevator buttons and door handles and railings. Like, imagine getting food without a car, without touching anyone or anything. It's really hard. And authorities are trying to crack down. They announced today that they're closing city parks, trying to keep people more separated. But at the end of the day, when you live that densely packed, it's difficult to control the spread. And so when you look at the curve - and it's going up really steeply - that's part of what you're seeing.

KELLY: And you get some of the issues of just enforcement in a city like New York, where people are living in - a lot of them living in small apartments. And I was watching press briefings today where they were talking about closing playgrounds, as you mentioned, closing parks and just the difficulty of keeping people out, keeping people from congregating.

I want to flip to both of you with - for your take on this question before we go, which is that all of these projections for what might happen to the curve and when it will flatten - the projections are based on models. The models are only as good as the data fed into them. What are some of the assumptions for each city? Becky, you go first.

HERSHER: So one of the big things that the leading nationwide model assumes is that states that haven't put strict social distancing measures in place will do so within a week from now. And that's a big if, right? We can't say what governors will do. The other thing is it assumes that all states will keep the measures in place until June 1. That's a really long time. You know, the White House's guidelines have only been extended until the end of the month. And so that's a big assumption that's baked into all of these curves that we're looking at.

KELLY: And, John, how about in California?

RUWITCH: Yeah. In California, it's a similar situation. I mean, there's - the governor was speaking earlier today about preparing for a two-thirds increase in the number of hospital beds. And they showed various charts about which direction the epidemic will go. It's all dependent on people sheltering at home and hunkering down, basically. And as he said, you know, it's actions that are really going to affect the way this goes, not projections.

KELLY: All right. That is NPR's John Ruwitch reporting from a balcony in the Bay Area and Rebecca Hersher reporting on what's happening in New York.

Thanks so much, both of you.

RUWITCH: Thank you.

HERSHER: Thanks.

136,1541,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-20-facebook-blacklists-free-speech-video-platform-brighteon.html,2020-05-20,Facebook blacklists free speech video platform Brighteon.com to silence humanitarian voices of pioneering women like Judy Mikovits – TAKE ACTION,"(Natural News) Brighteon.com is a popular, independent video platform that features humanitarian free speech videos including those of pioneering women like Dr. Judy Mikovits and Chinese freedom leader Jennifer Zeng.

As part of its war against courageous women who dare to challenge the status quo, Facebook has now blacklisted all links from Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com following the user posting of a documentary featuring Dr. Mikovits — “Plandemic” — which questions the standard narrative about the coronavirus vaccine and the W.H.O.

Various language versions of the Plandemic documentary were posted by other users, not by the owners or operators of Brighteon.com or NaturalNews.com. Yet because these videos were earning a large number of shares on Brighteon, as well as editorial coverage on Natural News, Facebook chose to blacklist all links from both platforms, regardless of the content, disallowing anyone from sharing any link from Brighteon or NaturalNews.

This means Facebook has blacklisted hundreds of thousands of videos and articles on gardening, smoothie recipes, nutrition, pet care, diabetes prevention, women’s reproductive health and other topics that offer extraordinary wisdom and aid for humanity. Because Brighteon is a free speech platform, it also hosts videos on more controversial topics, but this is the nature of a free speech platform. Brighteon.com does not endorse the content of every video on its platform.

We believe that Facebook’s efforts to blacklist a competing content platform qualifies as illegal “anti trust” action under U.S. law, and we are asking for your help to demand Facebook remove its blacklisting of competing content platforms. (See action items below.)

Facebook is now dictating what you are allowed to read or even THINK about every subject of controversy

Facebook’s blocking of shared content links goes too far. Even when a user chooses to share a link that she finds valuable, Facebook decides that you can’t share the links you want to share because Facebook disagrees with the content. This fascist “digital book burning” approach allows Facebook to control every conversation, every debate and every “fact” by disallowing all views with which it disagrees.

In fact, by blacklisting entire websites that feature user-generated content such as videos and articles, Facebook is discriminating against all the users on those sites, regardless of the nature of their content (which varies widely).

Currently, Facebook is disallowing all views that contradict the W.H.O., which is obviously run by communist China, an anti-human rights regime with a long, documented history of organ harvesting, political executions and extreme violations of fundamental human rights. This puts Facebook in the position of protecting one of the most heinous anti-human rights political regimes in the history of human civilization. While courageous American scientists and brave Chinese dissenters are silenced, Facebook catapults the propaganda of communist China to the forefront, calling their lies “facts” while everyone who questions the propaganda is silenced.

Why is this tolerated in America? Why is Facebook even allowed to continue to exist when it demonstrates such disdain for the values of free expression that gave rise to America’s greatness?

Not surprisingly, Twitter has also banned our channels in order to prevent us from raising awareness about what appears to be coordinated, illegal censorship among techno-fascist corporations that are obviously protecting communist China and its W.H.O. propaganda institution that repeatedly downplayed the severity of the coronavirus outbreak and pressured the global community to keep air traffic open with China, even as Chinese citizens were spreading the virus around the world.

To defend our right to speak and share honest, humanitarian information that can help save lives and awaken minds, we need your help to voice our protest against Facebook and Twitter using the steps detailed below.

In the mean time, we are encouraging everyone to move over to the new social media network AllSocial.com. Here are the channels we’ve set up there which are just beginning to gain a following.

Facebook can be emailed at [email protected]

When sending an email to Facebook, be polite and offer your existing account name, then explain why you are calling for NaturalNews.com and Brighteon.com to be reinstated as sharable content sites.

You might use an email subject like, “Please stop blocking sharing of Brighteon.com and NaturalNews.com”

Action Item #5: File a complaint with the FTC

The FTC handles anti-trust matters, and it’s clear that Facebook’s blacklisting of a competing content network hosting third party content is a monopolistic, anti-trust action.

You can file an online complaint with the FTC starting with this link:

FTCcomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted?NextQID=192&Url=%23%26panel1-6&SubCategoryID=0#crnt

From there, you answer a series of questions and finalize the complaint.

For this complaint, you did not lose money, but you were deprived of your civil rights to engage in online speech because a social media network (Facebook) engaged in anti-trust, anti-competitive blocking behavior designed to harm a competitor and give Facebook monopoly control over online speech. In addition, there are over 44,000 other users of Brighteon whose civil rights have also been violated by this discriminatory blacklisting of Facebook.

This is the basis for a class-action civil rights complaint against Facebook for its discriminatory policies that act as unfair, monopolistic practices that harm individuals with minority views.

Action Item #6: File a civil rights complaint with the Dept. of Justice

Facebook’s discriminatory blacklisting of an entire platform (Brighteon) that is owned by a minority woman is a civil rights violation that also extends to you when you try to share content from Brighteon.

The US Dept. of Justice investigates civil rights violations that are submitted via this form:

https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/

This form allows you to describe the violation of your civil rights, which includes the right to share First Amendment protected content from hosting platforms, especially when those platforms feature women or oppressed minorities who are engaged in protected speech.

Facebook specifically blacklisted Brighteon after various users uploaded content featuring a female science pioneer named Dr. Judy Mikovits, who formerly conducted research for the National Cancer Institute and who expresses dissenting views on the coronavirus pandemic and its possible resolutions.

No tech platform has the right to violate the civil rights of millions of Americans.

“I think we have to all recognize that we’re not moving beyond COVID-19,” Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti announced last week. “We’re learning to live with it. We’ve never been fully closed, we’ll never be completely open until we have cure.” Mayor Garcetti did not indicate when the cure might be forthcoming, but he was rather certain about the continued lockdown. Embattled residents of Los Angeles might wonder who is calling the shots during the pandemic.

The Los Angeles County Public Health Director is Dr. Barbara Ferrer, but local residents expecting a virologist, molecular biologist, or epidemiologist at the helm would be disappointed. Many were surprised to learn that, unlike her predecessor Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Dr. Ferrer is not even a medical doctor.

Ferrer earned a doctorate in “Social Welfare,” which might draw a blank from someone with a PhD in physics, mathematics, or history. Ferrer earned her PhD at Brandeis, which is sketchy on the course of study for social welfare. On the other hand, graduate Freida Kapor Klein touts hidden bias, diversity and inclusion. University of North Carolina professor La Verne Reid, speaks of “health inequities,” and Michael Levine, chief knowledge officer of the Sesame Workshop, hails “social justice policymaking.” Still, there may be more to it.

The Social Welfare doctoral program at UC Berkeley, “is designed to inspire independence and originality of thought in pursuit of knowledge.” The social welfare program develops scholars “who make significant contributions to social work and social welfare teaching, research, policy development and analysis, and administration” and “address a wide range of contemporary societal problems.” Social welfare doctor Barbara Ferrer did not study at Berkeley, but before her master’s in public health at Boston University, she earned a BA in “Community Studies” at UC Santa Cruz.

Community studies, the university explains, dates from 1969 and was “a pioneer in addressing principles of social justice, specifically inequities arising from race, class, and gender dynamics in society.” Students in the program “spend six months participating in and analyzing the work of a social justice organization,” and graduates have been placed in “food justice organizations, immigrant rights centers, homeless resource and support groups, queer and transgender organizations,” and other groups, “all pursuing a social justice mission.”

That background got Ferrer hailed as a “public health hero,” who with her partners “developed a blueprint for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities which would immediately enact change, beginning with the way research data was collected and received about health and morbidity to represent racial, ethnic and language differences.” That does not amount to medical science, but for Barbara Ferrer it didn’t matter.

With her MPH and doctorate in social welfare, Ferrer duly became health commissioner for Boston, then the chief strategy officer for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation which “supports children and families as they strengthen and create conditions that propel vulnerable children to achieve success as individuals and as contributors to the larger community and society.” In 2017, Ferrer made the move west to Los Angeles County, home to 10 million residents, approximately the population of Sweden.

Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas pronounced Ferrer “uniquely qualified to lead and serve Los Angeles County’s diverse populations,” and the county granted her an annual salary of $376,635. Three years later Ferrer pulls down a cool $465,411, more than the official salary of the president of the United States. As the coronavirus pandemic unfolded and Garcetti locked down Los Angeles, it emerged that Ferrer was not a medical doctor. When some questioned her qualifications, Ferrer pushed back.

“This is a tough job for anybody to have to do,” Ferrer told reporters. “The one thing I do want to note is I don’t make decisions by myself. I have an amazing team of public health practitioners.” As residents might have noted, it’s not Los Angeles County that has the amazing team but Barbara Ferrer her own self. The unelected health boss clearly has a sense of her own power.

Last week, after Dr. Anthony Fauci argued for keeping the lockdown in place, Ferrer announced that absent “dramatic change to the virus” the county would continue its shutdown for the next three months. Mayor Garcetti chimed in with “longer than three months,” followed by the proclamation that Los Angeles would “never be completely open,” until we have a “cure.” That was the position of California Gov. Gavin Newsom who said on May 7 that California would not return to normal until a vaccine for COVID-19 was discovered. As many in California and across the country have noted, that marks a steep escalation from “flattening the curve.”

Los Angeles County public health boss Barbara Ferrer is good with the lockdown, and the $465,611-a-year social welfare queen does not appear disturbed by the millions now out of work, the countless businesses going bust, and the students missing school. Barbara Ferrer is not a medical doctor but she boasts a background in the non-disciplines of “community studies” and “social welfare.” That makes Barbara Ferrer the ideal choice for politicians eager to exploit a pandemic for political ends, even if it deprives the people of their most basic rights.",fake
139,1744,http://sputniknews.com/world/202005221079372358-the-curious-case-of-low-covid-19-death-rate-in-india/,2020-05-22,The ‘Curious’ Case of Low COVID-19 Death Rate in India,"New Delhi (Sputnik): New Delhi is under sharp attack from a few sections of society for its handling of COVID-19: initially for a low testing rate in a country with over 1.3 billion and more recently for understating the number of deaths.

While countries with better health infrastructure accounted for over 90 percent of reported deaths from COVID-19 alongside a mortality rate as high as 15 percent of those infected, in contrast, the densely populated sub-Asian nation of India has a mortality rate of 3.2 percent. Experts have been attempting to explain the reason for this comparatively low rate. Some suggest demographics, varying immune systems and the pile-up of cases in big cities as the cause of the low death rate.

Various factors could be responsible for the comparatively low number of deaths in the country. India’s young population could be acting as a shield against the coronavirus, according to some, combined with a purported immunity that resists the disease, Dr. Arvind Kumar, a chest surgeon in New Delhi who previously received the highest award for medical practitioners in India, told Sputnik.

Nations with a high load of coronavirus cases, including the US, with a high fatality ratio – the percentage of deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases – at 6 percent, while European countries accounted for an even higher death rate. The UK reported fatality rate is thought to be 14.4 percent, France at 15.2 percent and Italy 14 percent, per data presented by by the Johns Hopkins University.

""In terms of case mortality per 100000 population, India has so far about 0.2 deaths per hundred thousand population vis-a-vis approx. 4.1 deaths per 10000 population for the world as a whole,"" the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on 20 May, adding, “Aggressive and early measures have shown encouraging results”.

Young Population of India

Indian census data suggests that half of the nation's population is under 25, almost 600 million people. The country has a median age of 28 in 2019, while the US and UK stand at 38 and 40, respectively.

The fact that 80 percent of people affected by the virus India are under 60 has played in favour of the country says Kumar, citing that India’s constantly improving recovery rate is now 40 percent.

“In the US and Europe, it is the old people who have been dying and old people constitute a large percentage of their population. Whereas in India, people above 70 constitute a small percentage of our population. And even in our setup, if you look at these 3000 people who have died, at least 60-70 percent of them are those who are above 60 and having diseases.”

According to Health Ministry data, a small section of people, 17 percent of COVID-19 patients in the country, are above 60 and that age group accounts for 60 percent of deaths in India.

Body Immunity

The exposure of people to harsh environmental conditions, including comprised water and air and other kinds of pollution from a young age has helped in some way to gain additional immunity against infection, claims Kumar.

“The extreme environmental factors have remained an integral part of the Indian population, therefore, the body becomes immune to regular infections as our immune system automatically starts building the antibodies to act against the enemy,” said Kumar, also the chairman of Center of Chest Surgery.

Indians have natural immunity, compared to those from western countries, which could play a role against the coronavirus, offers the doctor, adding that these assertions are mere conjecture and suggesting that several societal elements are simultaneously contributing in small proportions.

Less Stress on Health Infrastructure

Earlier, India quickly ramped up health facilities, gaining crucial time by imposing lockdowns at an early stage on 24 March with just 500 cases recorded. With only 0.55 beds per 1000 population in government hospitals, the country built COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and converted old train carriages into isolation wards.

“The health facilities in India are still not flooded the way it happened in Europe and USA, they were caught off guard and soon their ICU were overwhelmed with patients. Whereas India used the lockdown period aggressively, we have made preparations so that even if now the cases are increasing, the health facilities are here to take care,” said Kumar.

He added that there were instances when ventilators were not available to patients in France. “Fortunately that situation has not arisen in India, and it's unlikely to arise with the present state of preparedness,” he added.

Accumulation of Cases in Metro Cities

The more vulnerable Indian states, with more fragile healthcare systems, are still not bearing the brunt of the coronavirus cases in the country, as most cases have been recorded in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Gujarat, said the doctor.

“The good thing is that 50 percent of our cases are actually confined to three states: Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. They constitute nearly 50 percent of the volume of the cases. And the most vulnerable states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh still have the least amount of cases,” added Kumar.

The worst-affected India state is Maharashtra, which accounts for 39,297 COVID-19 positive cases and 1390 deaths, out of an estimated 3400 deaths in the country. Similarly, Tamil Nadu has 13,191 infections, Gujarat 12,537 and Delhi 11,088.

The 'Grim' Future

These dynamics can quickly change due to reverse migration, warns the doctor. The more people who become unemployed and are forced to return to their hometowns and taking less protective measures, the more cases could arise in India’s more remote locations.

Kumar suggested that infections in India could increase to 4,000,000-5,00,000 with relaxed social norms in several states by the time the country hits the peak in June-July. ""It's only by July end that India will see a decline in number of infections, till then a temporary spurt is expected,"" he offered.",fake

""Another round of checks for illegal immigrants. Can you believe it?"" the Kentucky Republican said during a speech on the Senate floor.

The Democratic plan opens the door for more immigrants to get federal cash by extending eligibility to those with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers instead of a Social Security number.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell assailed the $3 trillion spending package from House Democrats on Thursday. He expressed ire in particular at a provision extending eligibility for stimulus checks to immigrants who were left out of the initial wave of federal payments.

During a speech on the Senate floor, McConnell said the move would benefit undocumented people in the US.

""Another round of checks for illegal immigrants. Can you believe it?"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally. My goodness, what an oversight. Thank goodness Democrats are on the case.""

He also took a swipe against a measure within the bill to temporarily suspend a cap on the amount of state and local taxes that could be deducted from federal income taxes, which would benefit mostly high-income taxpayers living in highly-taxed states.

McConnell's comments illustrate the fierce GOP opposition to the Democratic plan. Republicans already declared it dead-on-arrival in the Senate, as they've expressed alarm over the ballooning federal deficit.

Under the CARES Act approved in March, nearly 150 million Americans qualified for $1,200 stimulus checks with an extra $500 per child — as long as they had a valid Social Security number. The requirement shut out undocumented immigrants from receiving the cash, a similar step taken when the Bush administration approved a round of direct payments in early 2008.

Up to 15.4 million people in mixed-status families were excluded from receiving the stimulus checks, according to the Migration Policy Institute. That figure includes 1.2 million American citizens married to undocumented immigrants.

The new Democratic plan would send $1,200 federal checks to Americans — including children — and limit the maximum amount a household can receive at $6,000. But instead of a Social Security number, recipients only need an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, which opens the door for immigrants already paying taxes to get the payments.

Republican support for another round of stimulus checks is slim at the moment. It's a stark contrast to the swelling number of Democratic lawmakers supporting recurring payments to tide over people through the pandemic as unemployment rises to staggering levels unseen since the Great Depression.

It's not immediately clear that a deal will be struck among lawmakers to include stimulus checks in the next coronavirus relief package and it's up in the air whether compromise is possible.

Rep. Kevin Brady, the top GOP lawmaker on the House Ways and Means Committee, threw cold water on the idea of backing more direct payments, The Washington Post reported.

""I think our main focus should be getting people back to work. I think that's the key, both short term and long term, for the economy and for families,"" he said.",real

Now, he has taken aim at the prime minister’s closest right-hand man.

Piers Morgan has “banned all cabinet ministers” from appearing on his show, Good Morning Britain (GMB), following news that Dominic Cummings, a senior adviser to Boris Johnson, allegedly breached the government’s coronavirus lockdown rules.

Making the announcement via Twitter, Mr Morgan - well renowned for stirring controversy - said that, “due to today’s developments, I am regretfully forced to ban all cabinet ministers from appearing on Good Morning Britain.”

“Only exceptions will be those who didn’t publicly support Cummings breaching lockdown,” the TV personality added.

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Morgan has been a staunch critic of the government’s response, describing it as a “shambles.”

This situation has finally sent you mad. 🥴 — Helen Hims (@helenhims) May 24, 2020

Dominic Cummings has come under heavy fire this weekend over accusations that he abandoned lockdown on two occasions to drive 260 miles from London to visit his parents in the northeastern English county of Durham. It is widely reported that Cummings made the first trip at a time when he believed he had been infected with COVID-19.

Despite apparent anger at Mr Cummings’ behaviour among Brits, a number of government ministers came out to defend him before his second breaching of the lockdown was revealed by The Mirror and The Observer.

The Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, has said accusations that Mr Cummings “travelled backwards and forwards” are “completely untrue,” and that since returning to London from his first trip on April 14, he has stayed in the capital.

“I certainly know that the first one you mention, of travelling back up (to Durham), I know that is not true,” Mr Shapps told Sky News’ Sophie Ridge on Sunday, adding that Cummings is a “stickler for the rules.”

Mr Shapps said that Cummings was “trying to do his best” for his four-year-old son who was “in danger of having both his parents fall ill,” and therefore Mr Cummings took, “perfectly sensible and rational steps.”

In his own defence, Cummings said to the media that, “I behaved reasonably and legally… it’s a question of doing the right thing, it’s not about what you guys think.”

Despite reportedly pledging his “full support” to Mr Cummings, and refusing to throw him “to the dogs,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure from his cabinet to fire the senior adviser.

Prominent pro-Brexit Conservative MP Steve Baker has said that Cummings must resign.

“Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the government, the prime minister, our institutions or the Conservative party,” Baker wrote on The Critic website.",fake

Editor, Health Impact News

On Monday this week (May 18, 2020) Moderna put out a press release stating that they had seen positive results to the first phase of their COVID-19 vaccine trial.

The news sent their stock prices surging, as the pharmaceutical company is working with Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases which Fauci heads.

However, that all changed on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, when Stat News published an article stating that Moderna did not produce any data to back their claims.

Heavy hearts soared Monday with news that Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate — the frontrunner in the American market — seemed to be generating an immune response in Phase 1 trial subjects. The company’s stock valuation also surged, hitting $29 billion, an astonishing feat for a company that currently sells zero products. But was there good reason for so much enthusiasm? Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the vaccine may be. While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. Even the figures the company did release don’t mean much on their own, because critical information — effectively the key to interpreting them — was withheld. (Source.)

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. also published his own observation on the little bit of data that was disclosed via his Instagram Account:

CATASTROPHE! Moderna Vaccine has 20% “Serious” Injury Rate in High Dose Group

Moderna’s cheery press release this morning, the clinical trial results for its groundbreaking COVID vaccine could not be much worse. The vaccine, developed and championed by Anthony Fauci and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental MRNA technology that the two men hoped would allow rapid deployment to meet President Trump’s ambitions “warp speed” time line. Dr Fauci was so confident of his shot’s safety that he waved ferret and primate studies (Moderna suspiciously reported no health data from its mouse studies.) That appears to have been a mistake. Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high dose cohort (250 mcg)suffered a “serious adverse event” within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Moderna did not release its clinical trial study or raw data, but its press release, which was freighted with inconsistencies acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as “Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention.” Moderna allowed only exceptionally healthy volunteers to participate in the study. A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to “every person on earth”. That is the threshold that Gates has established for ending the global lockdown. Moderna did not explain why it reported positive antibody tests for only eight participants. These outcomes are particularly disappointing because the most hazardous hurdle for the inoculation is still ahead; challenging participants with wild COVID infection. Past attempts at developing COVID vaccines have always faltered at this stage as both humans and animals achieved robust antibody response then sickened and died when exposed to the wild virus. Moderna’s press announcement heralded “Positive Interim Phase 1 findings”. I have forwarded that claim to my colleagues in securities law; FTC rules restrict the amount of lipstick public companies may slather on bad donkeys.

The U.S. Government has invested about half a million dollars in the Moderna experimental COVID vaccine so far.

Now today, Thursday May 21st, while record numbers of Americans in the millions and climbing are without jobs, UK drug company AstraZeneca has announced that it has received $1.2 BILLION from the U.S. Government to receive 300 million vaccine doses starting this fall of a COVID-19 vaccine that is still in development and not even approved yet.

by Eric Sagonowsky

FierceParma

Excerpts:

Only days after Moderna reported positive early results for its potential COVID-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca has stolen the spotlight back. On Thursday, the U.K. drug giant scored a $1.2 billion contribution from the United States for development, production and delivery of its potential shot starting this fall. The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It isn’t replicating, so it can’t cause an ongoing infection in recipients, AZ says. The company hopes the vaccine can deliver a strong immune response from one dose by triggering the body to produce the spike protein and attack the novel coronavirus upon infection. AstraZeneca has signed up to deliver 400 million doses through its initial supply agreements. The United States deal—through the HHS’ BARDA agency—follows a U.K. pact unveiled Sunday for 100 million total doses. That gives the U.S. delivery of about 300 million vaccine doses starting this fall. BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, says the money is “intended to help enable the Operation Warp Speed goal of making doses available by the end of 2020 and additional doses by the end” of the first quarter of 2021. President Donald Trump unveiled the “Warp Speed” program at a Rose Garden event late last week.

As Health Impact News reported last week, President Trump appointed Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccines division, as Chief Adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s project to fast-track a COVID-19 vaccine.

Dr. Slaoui is yet another Big Pharma leader Trump has added to his medical advisors with ties to Bill Gates, and has previously worked on vaccine development with his other medical advisors, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, and CDC Director Robert Redfield who all worked together with Bill Gates in the past to develop an HIV vaccine. See:

While the future of a COVID-19 vaccine is still uncertain, one thing is very clear: a vast majority of the wealth of the United States is being transferred to Big Pharma as thousands of businesses are now closing down due to the COVID-19 scare while the U.S. Government gives hundreds of BILLIONS (maybe over $1 TRILLION now??) to Big Pharma, for ventilators, face masks, hospitals and hospital ships, COVID-19 tests that are not even accurate, and the list goes on and on….

The United Nations takes a page from 1984 with a list of offensive words

According to the United Nations, the word “wife” is apparently offensive to some people. So is “husband”.

Their reasoning? Those words are not gender-neutral. So to “create a more equal world,” the UN has published an initial list of 14 words they want you to stop using… as well as the acceptable substitute.

The word manpower is offensive, naturally, because it relies on the base “man”. And anything that has to do with a man is offensive and terrible in this new world of ours.

So instead of “manpower”, the UN wants you to say “workforce”.

Same with congressman. Though frankly the word ‘congress’ should be far more offensive than ‘man’. But nevertheless, the UN wants you to say ‘legislator’.

Instead of husband or wife, the UN wants you to say “spouse.”

In regards to this website, somehow “Sovereign Gender Fluid Homo Sapien” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue.

Oregon lockdown lifted… for a few hours

A judge ruled that Oregon Governor Kate Brown’s lockdown order could only go so far.

After 28 days, emergency decrees in Oregon require legislative approval. But Governor Brown did not receive that approval.

So a group of Oregon churches who were forced to close due to the shelter-in-place order sued the government. And the judge ruled in their favor– the entire state lockdown was ruled illegal, and the judge ordered that it be immediately lifted.

But that only lasted a few hours.

Governor Brown immediately appealed the ruling and took it to the state’s Supreme Court.

While the lower court’s ruling wasn’t overturned, the Supreme Court did cave to the Governor’s emergency motion to keep the lockdown in place while the lawsuit continued.

Of course, the Governor could have just called the legislature back to approve her lockdown order… or perhaps she was too afraid that the voters’ representatives would take her newfound power away?

It was a safer bet to let the Supreme Court decide, since Governor Brown appointed five of the seven justices.

Connecticut hires $2 million ‘reopening consultant’

There’s a lucrative new business opportunity in the Land of the Free: consulting state and local governments about how to re-open their economies.

How lucrative, you ask?

Well, the State of Connecticut has hired a consulting company to advise them on how to reopen the state after lockdown ends.

The state will pay a target of $2 million, which means it could end up being more.

But don’t worry, says Connecticut’s governor, because the state will likely be reimbursed by the federal government.

And why not?

The Fed is printing trillions of dollars worth of magic money.

What’s a measly $2 million to pay consultants to tell politicians how to stop being dictators?

New York tax revenue down $8 billion, or 68% compared to last April

Weird how when you shut down the economy, somehow the tax revenue stops flowing.

Tax revenue is down 68%, or almost $8 billion, compared to last April.

New York is now facing a yearly budget gap of $13.3 billion.

But New York did receive over $5 billion from the federal government’s CARES Act, and the city is already whining for more federal money.

Why did anyone ever work at all, when we could have just been printing money this whole time?

Restaurants are starting to collect customer info for contact tracing

Many American cities are considering forcing restaurants to collect information from patrons to assist in “contact tracing.”

That way, if someone who visited the restaurant is diagnosed with coronavirus, authorities can contact people who may have been exposed.

Customers must provide information like their name, phone number, address, and other contact information.

This is already required in some places, like Auckland, New Zealand. And it has already turned creepy.

One said she thought nothing of leaving her phone number, email address, and physical address at a Subway restaurant she visited.

Then she received a Facebook message, an Instagram request, and a text from a Subway staff member who wanted to take her on a date.

She was especially concerned because her home address was also available to the overzealous man.

And as creepy as that is, this is just one aspect of the privacy issues.

The government will also be able to track your whereabouts.

And unlike the creepy man from Subway, the government won’t let you ignore its advances.

Kansas City churches forced to keep records of attendees

It’s not just restaurants being forced to collect information on customers.

Churches in Kansas City, Missouri are now required to keep a list of church attendees.

That way, the state can look at the list for contact tracing if someone from the church tests positive for coronavirus.

The rule requires churches and synagogues to “record the names, contact information, and approximate entry/exit time of all customers who are on premises for more than 10 minutes.”

If a not-so-deadly virus can erase all the most basic rights– from assembly to religion– were we ever really free to begin with?

Instead, Hampton, like thousands of other autoworkers heading back to plants after an eight-week pandemic-induced shutdown, kept driving to work on Monday — the first step in the historic restart of an industry that accounts for nearly 4% of the nation’s economy.

""The factory is the most cross-contaminated workplace next to a buffet. Period,"" said Hampton, 39, of Detroit, who installs seats. ""There is no way to make it coronavirus-proof.""

Most workers at FCA Warren Truck came prepared for a restart under new safety guidelines, with masks already strapped around their faces. But many expressed concern and frustration about going back to work when uncertainty about the virus remains.

How successful the resumption of auto production ultimately will be, will depend in large part on whether Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and General Motors Co. can keep their employees safe at work. Workers who returned to work Monday expressed a mixture of optimism and skepticism that it will be possible to prevent COVID-19 from spreading in manufacturing plants.

Hampton's concerns weren't eased after the eight-hour shift. He kept thinking about that message from the former first lady telling him the importance of staying home to stay safe, he said: ""This is unreal. We are going back to work to build a truck while Michelle Obama is telling us to stay home.""

Meanwhile, work was ""pretty smooth"" at Ford Motor Co.’s assembly and stamping plants in Wayne, said MaryLisa Poole, 57, of Canton Township, who works as a receiver for trucks delivering materials: ""As far as the virus, (there's) nothing to mention. I wore my mask. I had my face shield.”

The restart of vehicle production at GM, Ford and FCA, one week after major suppliers resumed production, is the linchpin of an unprecedented and coordinated effort to rev up almost the entire auto industry, foreign and domestic, after the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic and government responses to it.

""It’ll be the first time in history everybody comes back up at the same time,"" Gary Johnson, Ford's chief manufacturing and labor affairs officer, told The Detroit News last week. ""So that will be a test.""

The restart will test the new health and safety protocols the automakers have developed and implemented already in China, in Europe and in U.S. plants producing medical equipment and supplies. How effective those protocols prove to be should help ease anxieties of those returning to work.

Hampton reserved some of his criticism for the UAW, saying: ""I am little taken back because I thought there would be resistance from the union because of this pandemic."" To him, there's no logic in going back into a plant to build trucks with new cases still cropping up: ""If the numbers decrease, then I would see more reasoning into bringing us back.""

Michigan on Monday confirmed 24 deaths tied to the virus, marking the ninth straight day with fewer than 100 new deaths from the illness reported in the state. Monday was the fourth consecutive day that the state had fewer than 800 new cases of COVID-19, for a total 51,915 known cases since reporting began, according to state data.

But while the UAW can advocate for stronger health and safety protections, the contracts between the union and the automakers give the companies the final say on when production resumes, UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said.

""The UAW will continue to do everything we can to protect the health and safety of all members as plants reopen,"" the UAW said in a statement Sunday, noting that the union continues to advocate for the automakers to test all workers for COVID-19 when testing becomes more widely available.

Prior to restarting, the automakers did not know exactly how many workers would return, or how many would be unable to work after answering questions about their potential exposure to the virus. But, Rothenberg said he heard from all three companies Monday that they had full staffing, and in some cases, more than expected. Absenteeism did not appear to be an issue.

In a statement, FCA said it was ""pleased"" with Monday's restart. The automaker brought back some 12,000 U.S. employees. ""Everyone followed the new protocols and our plants were fully staffed to start production,"" the company said. ""We are very confident that we have all the right protection measures in place to keep them all safe.""

As they shuffled back into work Monday morning, however, some employees at the Warren Truck plant were not quite as convinced. More than 1,280 workers were called back to work there for the first shift from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m. A second shift is scheduled to restart in a few weeks.

At least one worker was sent home after answering ""yes"" to being exposed to the coronavirus.

Theresa Segura, 61, of Lincoln Park recently saw her brother, who has tested positive for the virus. She'll have to get tested now before she can go back to work, which is fine with her because she doesn't want to get any of her co-workers sick: ""There's a lot of other people out here sick already, and you don't want another life to pass away.""

Segura knew some of FCA Warren Truck workers who died from COVID-19 complications. At least four Warren Truck employees have died after contracting the coronavirus, prompting heightened anxiety among employees at the plant about returning to work.

""Everybody should be tested before they go in the plant because you can go in the plant and get sick and you don't know it,"" said Segura. ""You are risking your life to go in there.""

Not all employees will be tested for COVID-19, though the companies are offering testing through their medical teams or partner health systems to employees who have symptoms of the virus.

FCA assembly worker Richard Werth, 56, of Redford Township, a 25-year employee of the Warren Truck plant, was not necessarily excited about coming back Monday after being off for two months. But he wasn't concerned because he's already ""been out and about.""

""It's no biggie as long as they take precautions,"" he said. ""Just be safe. Keep your hands clean. Keep your distance.""

Meanwhile, Harnett Weatherspoon, 34, of Detroit works in the trim department at FCA's Warren Truck. He was ""very fearful of coming to work"" because he believes it's not safe, despite new virus-related safety protocols.

""If you guys have to do all this, it's not safe for us to be in here,"" Weatherspoon said of the company's safety precautions. ""Why am I coming to work with this on?"" he asked, pointing to the black mask around his head.

An FCA employee at Sterling Heights Assembly plant who returned early to help prepare the plant for restart was also sent home Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19, causing some concerns among the rank-and-file.

In a letter sent home to workers, Mark Stewart, the company's chief operating officer in North America, said workers were wearing the required face masks and safety glasses provided to them and that the company was continuing to strengthen its procedures.

Another complication for the industry, which provides hundreds of thousands of American jobs, is the potential for snarls in the supply chain. Already, Daimler AG said it was idling its Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama, which had reopened in late April, due to a parts shortage. Having to shut down factories after reopening them is the last thing automakers and their suppliers want, according to experts, and is a strain on their capital.

Mexico accounts for almost 40% of imported auto parts. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans last Wednesday to begin a phased reopening in his country on Monday to coincide with many U.S. plants. After some confusion about when exactly plants there are allowed to reopen, the Mexican government clarified that plants can begin reopening this week after receiving approval for their safety plans.

""The industry shut down all at the same time,"" said Jeff Schuster, head of global vehicle forecasting for LMC Automotive. ""In terms of a parts shortage, that's still a risk. And all it takes is many outbreaks in a supplier plant or assembly plant for things to have to get re-evaluated.""

The companies are returning workers in phases. GM last week restarted production at three engine and propulsion plants to fill its supply pipeline but is recalling one shift at most of its assembly plants this week. Ford's three-shift plants are starting with two, and two-shift plants with one. Fiat Chrysler has said it is basing its ramp up on demand and will reduce jobs per hour to ensure safe distancing.

Workers will go through safety briefings at all of the companies before production resumes. The companies also have sent home fliers and packets with information on the return-to-work procedures.

“The last thing we want is to see a spike when the governor starts pulling back restrictions,” said Jim Glynn, GM's vice president of global workplace safety. “The reason we are sharing all of this information is because we want to be successful. Everybody has to make that decision: ‘Do I feel comfortable coming to work?’ We want everybody to feel comfortable.""

The automakers have installed plexiglass barriers, signs and other cues to help with social distancing in the plants. Ford is providing wristwatches that beep when employees get within 6 feet and that can help with contact tracing if a case is identified.

The automakers are having employees fill out questionnaires asking them about travel and if they are experiencing symptoms. GM and Ford also are checking temperatures with thermal cameras; FCA is providing temperature strips for employees to check daily at home.

The protocols will be a transition, company executives say, adding that plant management will continue to follow up with employees about questions and concerns throughout the week.

""Every human being, myself included, is going to have some anxiety,"" said Shaun Whitehead, Ford's director of manufacturing, transmission and driveline components, last week. ""We're going to give ourselves some time. ... There are a lot of very small things that we do differently now.""

That's going to inverse.'

Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival

Airbnb is about connecting people. Before this crisis, we brought 2 million people together a day, and when this crisis ends, we're going to get back to doing just that. But to get there, we are going to need to be scrappy. We're going to be nimble, we're going to simplify our operations and focus on what makes us different: our community of hosts.

No one knows for sure [how the crisis will change the travel industry], but I can give you two thoughts. First, when the comeback starts, it will start locally. People are going to take trips that are close to home and they're going to want something affordable. Second, I think we're seeing that you can do a lot [via] video conferencing, and that's going to have a big impact on how often people travel for work. Business travel isn't going to go away, but I think it's going to look very different in the future.

We used to do a lot of travel for work and then we entertained ourselves on screens. That's going to inverse. I think we'll work more on screens and entertain ourselves in the real world.

I also think many people are realizing they don't have to be tethered to one city. So you'll see more people who are going to choose to live around the world, spending a few months at a time in different places. And we're going to focus in part on longer-term stays to better serve those people.

I've also been thinking about what won't change. In 1950, 25 million people crossed a border, and last year 1.4 billion people did. That happened because there is an innate human desire to travel, to explore and that is never going to go away. Travel may be on pause, but it's going to come back.",real
183,915,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/calls-helplines-america-increase-dramatically/,2020-05-14,Calls To Helplines In America Increase Dramatically,"Calls to helplines are increasing in America by as much as 891%, experts are warning of a mental health crisis and some officials are worried that America is not prepared to meet with this issue as well.

Compared to this time last year the national hotline that provides emergency help to those suffering from emotional stress has received 9 times more calls, with tens of thousands of Americans reaching out for assistance amid the current outbreak, according to officials.

Officials on the front lines of this outbreak are warning of a mental health crisis that will likely continue to increase over the coming weeks that the agencies have yet to properly prepare for.

The administration has approved millions of dollars in federal funding to boost mental health services, but some officials are suggesting that even this additional money may not be enough to support the increased counseling that will be needed amidst this crisis in the coming weeks of shut downs, social distancing and isolation.

The Disaster Distress Helpline at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration experienced an 891% increase in call volume last month in comparison to March of 2019, according to a spokesperson for the agency.

March 2020 experienced 338% more calls to the helpline than February 2020 when the outbreak really began to take hold in America and officials began to take more extreme measures to stop its spread. While specific total figures were not given, last month the agency received more than 22,000 calls and text messages from people seeking help.

Over the past weeks mental health has been discussed sporadically during official briefings. The President himself has even suggested to expect a massive jump in mental health issues. “You’re going to have massive depression,” he said. “You’re going to have depression in the economy also. … [Expect] massive drug use, massive depression, mental depression, massive numbers of suicide.”

The President signed a $2 Trillion emergency relief package known as the CARES ACT that sets aside $425 million for SAMHSA to help address mental health and substance use disorders that may arise as a result of this crisis, another $100 million has been marked to supplement the federal grant programs, and the bill includes $250 million for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics to increase access to mental health care services, as well as another $50 million for suicide prevention efforts, according to Health and Human Services.

According to the SAMHSA spokesperson they have been working closely with other agencies to address the growing mental health problems and to relax federal restrictions to make it easier for Americans to access the help that they need. But according to the official efforts thus far may still be insufficient to address what is believed will be happening in the weeks ahead, especially as the need for crisis counseling expands.

“Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children,” SAMHSA noted on its website devoted to the coronavirus.

Many Americans are experiencing increased fear, stress, and anxiety about stay at home and shelter in place orders, social distancing, supply shortages, unemployment, being sick, as well as this being not only on a national but global scale, along with worries of increased restrictions. Homeland security officials are hoping that the already unstable Americans could be propelled to stress induced violence associated with the pandemic and restrictions.

According to SAMHSA there are currently 57.8 million Americans that are currently living with mental or substance use disorders. The Disaster Distress Helpline is fully operational 24 hours a day for all 7 days of the week, all year long. It is staffed to “provide counseling and support before, during, and after disasters, and refer people to local disaster-related resources for follow-up care and support,” according to the agency’s website.

A big chunk of that time is spent testing the vaccine to make sure it's safe for people to take and that it works to prevent the disease.

Researchers are looking at every possible way to shorten this process for a coronavirus vaccine.

Three strategies have emerged to test a vaccine more quickly amid a crisis, vaccine experts say. They are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination.

Each approach comes with its own benefits and risks, according to vaccine experts we interviewed.

Read live updates about the coronavirus here.

Developing a vaccine is a critical element in squashing the coronavirus pandemic.

But there's no consensus on the best way to actually test a vaccine for safety and efficacy during a crisis. What there are, however, are three leading ideas on how to test vaccines. Each approach comes with unique pros and cons.

There are now more than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines in the works, at least 20 of which are expected to enter human testing within this year. But turning early research into a real vaccine requires time and resources.

Read more: Scientists are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine that can halt the pandemic in its tracks. Here are the top 3 candidates aiming to be ready this fall.

The potential ways to vet a possible coronavirus vaccine more quickly are human challenge trials, stepped wedge designs, and ring vaccination, according to top vaccine experts interviewed by Business Insider. All the approaches can speed up testing a vaccine, a process that normally takes multiple years with several distinct clinical trials.

But any of the strategies will test ordinary research protocols that call for substantial testing before a vaccine is used broadly. The safety bar is particularly high for vaccines since they are given to massive populations of healthy people. A pharmacist gives Jennifer Haller, left, the first shot in the first-stage safety study clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ted S. Warren/Associated Press

Additionally, some of the approaches carry ethical concerns. Challenge trials, for instance, promise a speedy answer as to whether a vaccine works, because people who get the immunization are then exposed to the virus. Those volunteers could be risking their lives if the vaccine fails and they become ill.

Others, like the ring vaccination strategy, wouldn't raise the same ethical worries but require more time. Ring vaccination has helped control outbreaks of smallpox and Ebola in the past. Dr. Francis Collins

Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said that running a gold-standard clinical trial, in which some people get the vaccine and others gets the placebo, in an area with a coronavirus outbreak, is likely to be the best approach.

""Why don't we just do this the way that would be most straightforward"" Collins said, ""which is to enroll tens of thousands of participants in areas where the virus is still circulating with an appropriate placebo control and see whether it works or not.""

No matter which approach is taken, there is also skepticism that any vaccine could be widely available within 18 months. That timeline has been echoed by prominent health officials, nonprofit leaders, and policymakers.

Read more: As more experimental coronavirus vaccines start human testing, industry leaders and experts doubt they'll be ready before 2022

That isn't stopping companies from racing to develop a vaccine in record time, with three leading vaccine programs aiming to be ready this fall for emergency use.

Here are the three main approaches that researchers are considering to test a coronavirus vaccine.

Human challenge trials offer speed but raise ethical concerns about exposing people to the virus

In challenge trials, participants would be vaccinated and then intentionally exposed to the virus. The design offers an attractive option for those wanting a quick answer.

""There are some people calling for that,"" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, said. ""You could decide in weeks whether this vaccine candidate works or doesn't."" Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group Mayo Clinic

One of the leading advocates for challenge studies is Dr. Stanley Plotkin. Plotkin has been in vaccine research for more than half a century, helping discover the rubella virus vaccine in the 1960s.

""We don't know whether there is such a thing as immunity to the virus,"" Plotkin told Business Insider. ""Until we know that, vaccines are going to be hypothetical. That's really the crucial question at the moment, and the sooner we know the answer to that, the better off we're going to be.""

Challenge studies could help answer that question quickly. Along with New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan, Plotkin argued that challenge studies are the way to go. While unusual, the design has been used before in humans for vaccines for influenza and malaria.

Arthur L Caplan NYU School of Medicine ""Deliberately causing disease in humans is normally abhorrent, but asking volunteers to take risks without pressure or coercion is not exploitation but benefiting from altruism,"" Plotkin and Caplan wrote. ""We are aware of multiple offers from people willing to volunteer for the challenge studies. As Shakespeare put it, 'Desperate diseases by desperate measures are relieved.'""

Mayo's Poland cautioned that a challenge trial can be done but may lead to unforeseen problems.

""I think there's a way to do it,"" he said. ""You have to be very, very careful about full informed consent because bad things can happen that you may not be able to predict or are not even thinking about. That's part of the history of vaccinology. It's that things happen that we don't expect.""

Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine researcher at Baylor College, said it took years to devise a challenge model for malaria, and a key consideration was having a treatment available in case the vaccine didn't work.

Maria Elena Bottazzi Dr. Maria Elena Bottazzi

""You have to have a way of getting rid of the virus or reducing the disease that the virus causes,"" she said.

Despite generating a lot of publicity, no vaccine company has announced plans to run such a study in COVID-19.

Collins told Business Insider he's skeptical of this approach and said he doesn't think it will play a role in developing a vaccine for COVID-19.

Starting a human challenge study would require having good manufacturing practice material that's ready to go, Collins said.

""None of these vaccine platforms are there yet,"" Collins said. ""When they get there, they will be ready also to start a standard efficacy trial enrolling thousands of patients, which is a much more compelling way to show whether the vaccine actually works in the real world.""

NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins speaks during a Senate hearing. Reuters

Collins also says that since challenge studies would use healthy young people as volunteers, they wouldn't necessarily provide a clear answer for efficacy for more vulnerable populations, like the elderly or those with chronic illnesses.

""And of course there are profound ethical questions about whether it is justifiable to put a healthy person at risk when we don't have a cure for this disease that they happen to get sick anyway,"" he continued. ""So I think at the present time, the case for it is pretty weak. The case against it is pretty strong.""

Stepped-wedge design has some prominent backers, including a leading vaccine program

A stepped-wedge design straddles the line between clinical testing and widespread use. The design evaluates a vaccine candidate during an outbreak while also providing significant quantities of the vaccine to the public. It's important to have some data showing that the vaccine is safe before using this strategy, though.

""The point is to provide some potential benefit while building a large and rigorous data set to evaluate its safety and effectiveness,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the FDA and a board member at Pfizer, wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb Reuters

Gottlieb laid out the example of using this design in a city suffering an outbreak. Large clusters of people would be vaccinated at staggered times. In Gottlieb's hypothetical, it could be 25,000 people being vaccinated every two weeks.

That could lead to 100,000 vaccinations in six weeks and allow researchers to compare the groups to see if the timing difference changed the likelihood of becoming infected. If the vaccine works, the groups that received it earlier should have significantly lower levels of COVID-19.

Pfizer's Mikael Dolsten Thomson Reuters Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, outlined a very similar strategy for its vaccine candidate. He told Business Insider that Pfizer's vaccine could be tested like this under an emergency use program this fall, vaccinating tens of thousands of people while collecting data to see if the vaccine works.

The ring vaccination strategy took down smallpox and Ebola, but requires precise and strenuous tracing

Ring vaccination studies helped tackle smallpox and Ebola. While it could have a role in COVID-19, the studies require significant public health infrastructure to run correctly.

""It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work for this,"" Bottazzi warned, saying ring vaccination requires rigorous contract tracing to find all the people who've been in contact with an infected person.

In ring vaccination, a team of researchers or public health workers quickly track down all the close contacts of an infected person. These potentially exposed people would then be vaccinated.

With the right resources, it can be a valuable approach to eradicating diseases. That's what happened in the latter half of the 20th century to eradicate smallpox. The disease had lingered for nearly two centuries after a vaccine was first developed in the 1790s. It remains the only disease to be vanquished by a vaccine.

The smallpox eradication program used two levels of contract tracing. It vaccinated everyone who had been in contact with a confirmed smallpox case. And then researchers also vaccinated the close contacts of all those potentially exposed people.

Ebola vaccines were tested in a similar fashion. In one of those trials, contacts were randomized to either immediately receive a vaccine or be immunized three weeks later. The end result was thousands of people were vaccinated, helping stop the spread of the virus while building the data that supported regulatory approval of a vaccine.

The US is unprepared to perform ring vaccination given the lack of testing and contract tracing currently available.

""We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,"" Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently told CNN. ""We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine if they are identified as either having an infection or being in contact.""",real

On the menu today: Certain elites have simply opted out of quarantine rules; wondering how much our news environment should be able to shift to non-virus news; the CDC says you’re less likely to catch the coronavirus from touching objects.

One Pandemic and Quarantine for the Elites, Another for Everyone Else

Our fight against the coronavirus is slowly and steadily improving, but . . . we’re still a long ways away from out of the woods. From the numbers on Worldometers, 1,552 Americans succumbed to the disease Tuesday and another 1,403 Americans on Wednesday. We’re trending down significantly from the roughly 2,500 per day at the beginning of the month, but . . . that’s still about a half a 9/11 per day. We’re diagnosing about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases a day; we were above 30,000 new cases per day for most of April.

The economic aftershocks have been calamitous. There’s never been a higher demand at food banks. Our kids are still out of school, and across the country, summer camps, programs, and other activities are being canceled. Schools aren’t sure if they will reopen in the fall, meaning that this just-barely-adequate-if-we’re-lucky “distance learning” may continue, in a situation that Michael Brendan Dougherty observes leaves parents with all of the costs of homeschooling but none of the benefits. Most kids haven’t seen a non-sibling peer in person in two-and-a-half months; the plan, I guess, is to continue this isolation through most of the rest of the year. In any other circumstance, we would consider that child abuse. In just about any other hardship that can befall a child, they still get to see their friends!

We’ve still got giant problems to work out. It’s one thing to reopen society in a way that accounts for a contagious virus; it’s another thing to reopen society in a way that accounts for a contagious virus and lawyers that are eager to sue people. The CDC says swimming pools should be safe as long as people take the usual social-distancing precautions outside the water, but across the country, cities are deciding to keep their public pools closed. The restaurant and bar industry, the movie-theater industry, the hotel and tourism industry, theme parks, airlines — all of them are desperately trying to figure out how to stay afloat with a small fraction of their usual customer base. Removing the government restrictions is one step, but people still need to feel safe using those businesses before they’ll come back in significant numbers.

Everybody’s enduring hardship in one form or another. Well, almost everybody.

From the beginning, we’ve seen evidence that the wealthy and well-connected could more or less buy their way out of the inconveniences and hardship of quarantines. This April story by Vicky Ward at CNN stuck with me:

Last week, a Washington, DC-based media executive who is used to attending 200 cocktail parties a year decided that he could take talking to his microwave no more. In contravention of the city’s shelter-in-place executive order, he secretly attended two different dinner parties in Georgetown, an affluent DC-neighborhood. When he first told me this, I assumed I had either misheard or misunderstood. “Virtual dinners right?” I asked. “No” was the reply. These were the old-fashioned, in-person sort. Each time, he explained, the host’s instructions were the same. For both dinners, he entered through the back gate of the property, so disapproving neighbors would not see him. He was told in advance that neither he, nor any other guests, could take any photographs or talk about the party. The first dinner was hosted by a movie producer. A group of four listened to music and sat under heated lamps six feet apart in the garden where they were served dinner. According to the executive, none had been in contact with anyone who had suffered Covid-19 — as far as they knew. All had been isolating. At that dinner party, the food was prepared by a live-in chef, who was masked and gloved, and then served by the producer’s wife. At the second party, held over the weekend at the home of a Democrat political operative, one of the guests brought the food: “lamb to belatedly celebrate Easter.” In attendance were an ambassador, a city councilman and a well-known lobbyist. The night was balmy and they all sat outside for hours. “People did not want to leave,” the media executive told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity, to avoid being Covid-shamed — a new shorthand term for people behaving with apparent indifference to the safety of others. “But everyone had been cooped up for so long, there was much to discuss.”

I’ll give you a moment to cope with the shock that a Washington-based media executive, a movie producer, a Democratic political operative, a Washington city councilman, and a well-known lobbyist and their spouses believed the rules didn’t apply to them. At least the ambassador could hide behind diplomatic immunity. (Where’s Roger Murtaugh when you need him?)

Apparently, quarantines are for the little people. If quarantines are optional for the wealthy and well-connected, we should not be surprised that they find them much more tolerable and worthy of extension than everyone else.

Last week, the New York Times reviewed data and concludes, “roughly 5 percent of residents — or about 420,000 people — left the city between March 1 and May 1. In the city’s very wealthiest blocks, in neighborhoods like the Upper East Side, the West Village, SoHo and Brooklyn Heights, residential population decreased by 40 percent or more, while the rest of the city saw comparably modest changes.” If you are wealthy enough to own a second home, you have another place to go if you deem the risk of remaining at your current residence too high.

Today in the New York Post, David Marcus unleashes a furious rant that his home city’s strict quarantine rules are choking the life out of the city:

Beloved haunts, storied rooms, perfect-slice joints are shuttered, many for good. The sweat equity of countless small-business owners is evaporating. Instead of getting people back to work providing for their families, our mayor talks about a fantasyland New Deal for the post-coronavirus era. Open the city. All of it. Right now. Broadway shows, beaches, Yankees games, the schools, the top of the freakin’ Empire State building. Everything. New Yorkers have already learned to socially distance. Businesses can adjust. The elderly and infirm can continue to be isolated.

One other indicator of the divide between those who are minimally impacted by the pandemic restrictions and the rest: Have you noticed how a portion of the news environment is moving on from the pandemic, even though our daily lives have not?

Are News Institutions Getting Tired of Covering the Coronavirus?

I go back and forth on how much the focus of the news should shift away from the pandemic, and how quickly. In normal times, the Michael Flynn unmasking revelations and arguments would be front-page news, day after day. You can tell that much of the world is eager to argue about Matt Lauer trying to return to public life, or how mean Alison Roman was to those poor celebrities like Chrissy Tiegen and Marie Condo. Jonathan Safran Foer takes to the New York Times to instruct us, “If you care about the working poor, about racial justice, and about climate change, you have to stop eating animals.”

You can see how many people are itching to return to the familiar culture-war fights — Kamala Harris introduced a resolution declaring use of the term “Wuhan virus” racist. The Atlantic unveiled a new special section on conspiracy theories, although I still haven’t found an article discussing the cover story in New York magazine asking whether Donald Trump has been an asset of Russian intelligence since 1987. The Washington Post warns that southern states are being reckless in how they’re reopening.

(Connecticut has now reopened retail stores, offices with an encouragement to continue working from home, university research programs, and outdoor zoos. I await the Washington Post feature story on how new clusters of coronavirus spread could soon flare across parts of the Nutmeg State.)

I’m not saying that non-coronavirus news doesn’t matter at all. But you’ve probably noticed that this newsletter turned into nearly all-coronavirus, all-the-time in March and hasn’t looked back. Sometimes I miss the old familiar political news and discussion, too. But the pandemic and its aftershocks are the biggest story in the world right now, one that shoves all other news — even traditionally big stories such as a presidential election or North Korea — into the background.

I wonder if coronavirus fatigue is driving increasing servings of silliness in our news diet.

For the past two months, one of the most dangerous places in the world has been a nursing home in New York state. Chris Cuomo teased his brother, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, about the size of his nose with a giant nasal-swab prop. I remind you this is CNN in prime time, and not Saturday Night Live. The brothers’ bickering was cute at the beginning of this pandemic, but we’re now approaching the end of its tenth week.

Don’t Touch That! . . . but It Probably Won’t Kill You

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its coronavirus guidelines slightly Wednesday, emphasizing that the virus spreads easily from person to person but “does not spread easily” in other ways, such as touching objects.

We would get through this ordeal easier if everyone in positions of authority could be a little more honest about what they know, what they think they know, and what they don’t know. I’ll be honest: I thought, based upon what we were seeing, that spread in places such as the New York City subways was driven in large part by people touching the same objects — poles, handrails, buttons, turnstiles, etc. Apparently, that was a smaller factor, and the primary factor was just people coming within six feet of each other.

ADDENDUM: Advice from Nicholas Kristof that many are sure to ignore: “The odd thing about reporting on the coronavirus is that the nonexperts are supremely confident in their predictions, while epidemiologists keep telling me that they don’t really know much at all. Some of that epidemiological humility should seep into public discourse.”",fake

A crystal ball would come in handy.

To say the coronavirus crisis has thrown theaters big and small into unprecedented turmoil is an understatement. Every theater has been jolted by the mandated shutdown of all non-essential businesses.

Taking the hardest hit in the theater community (outside of creatives who’ve lost their jobs) are the storefront organizations, most operating on a shoestring budget with nowhere near the deeper pockets of larger theater companies.

The stay-at-home edict came as many Chicago theaters were ready to open new productions and others were about to begin rehearsals for shows slated to debut in late April or May.

Other plays, caught in the middle of a run, were canceled, with a handful able to offer online streaming for ticket holders.

Many theaters also had major spring fundraisers postponed, canceled or moved online.

Some welcome relief came with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s announcement of the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund to provide financial assistance to artists, artisans and cultural organizations.

“We’re very grateful that so many people and organizations have come together to support the arts at this time,” said Leda Hoffmann, artistic direct of Strawdog Theatre, with an operating budget of $250,000. “There are still a lot of unknowns about the long-term effect of these closures on small organizations like us, but we know relief is needed now, and I’m glad we can get started.”

The League of Chicago Theatres says 93 of its 237 members have budgets of under $75,000 a year. At these smaller companies, one show’s revenue often helps pay for the next.

Strawdog’s staging of Brian James Polak’s “Welcome to Keene, New Hampshire” was set to begin April 17. Rehearsals were moved online, as was a fundraiser, but the show is postponed.

Hoffmann said it’s a scary time for storefront theaters, but she’s “grateful to have the flexibility of a smaller organization. Small theaters have always been able to find a way somehow. The finances are the big struggle, but the will is very much there.”

At Griffin Theatre, whose annual operating budget is around $400,000, the final two weekends of “Mlima’s Tale” (usually a show’s most lucrative dates) were canceled, as were two tours of the company’s highly successful children’s shows: “The Stinky Cheese Man” and “Frindle.” Artistic director Bill Massolia said the tours are a loss of $60,000 to $70,000.

Griffin has an online fundraising campaign going to raise money to pay the “Milma’s Tale” artists through the end of the run and finance the company through July.

“If we can just get through the summer, that will give us the breathing room to be able to figure out a strategy for the fall,” Massolia said. “This is all a little bit overwhelming.”

At Raven Theatre, which is also a rental house, artistic director Cody Estle said, “I’m wearing tracks into my wood floors because I keep pacing.”

Over the past few years, Raven, with an operating budget of $750,000, worked on making sure there were some reserves, Estle said. “But when I say reserves for a theater our size, it’s not very much. It could cover us for eight weeks or so.”

Broken Nose Theatre artistic director Elise Marie Davis said her biggest fear is that some companies won’t be able to bounce back. Broken Nose moved this season’s final show, Eric Reyes Loo’s “This Is Only a Test,” to next season. Davis said the company’s operating budget is “under six figures.”

“I think we’re going to see a very different theater scene moving forward,” she said. “My big fear is this will be a death sentence for some non-Equity theaters.”

How quickly will theatergoers, many of them older, return when the OK is given?

“Perhaps smaller spaces will be allowed to open firs,t” said League of Chicago Theatres executive director Deb Clapp. “Their audiences skew younger than some others, so maybe those audiences will be more willing to go back to the theater sooner. They may be in the best position for recovery. But, of course, that is all conjecture.”

Rivendell Theatre artistic director Tara Mallen said: “I am so encouraged by how much we have actually been able to accomplish online over these past three weeks — the play readings, the production meetings, the classes we have continued to teach. We are still working at Rivendell, still crafting stories that need to be shared and lifting up voices that need to be heard.”

She made a difference.,"Share All sharing options for: Michelle Abernathy wasn’t just another COVID-19 victim. She made a difference.

Torrence Jones remembers the day his girlfriend Michelle Abernathy learned a developmentally disabled resident of Ludeman Developmental Center, where they worked, had become the first person there to test positive for COVID-19.

It was March 28, a Saturday. Abernathy had stopped by the Park Forest campus to catch up on work. She was informed the stricken man lived in a housing unit under her supervision.

Abernathy, 52, made sure the resident was receiving proper care and that her staff had personal protective equipment, Jones said.

By the next night, Abernathy had a fever. Fifteen days later, she was dead, a victim of the coronavirus.

The Illinois Department of Human Services revealed this past week that the death toll at Ludeman has reached six — three staff members and three residents.

The latest to die: Jose Velez and Cephus Lee. They worked in Ludeman’s dietary department, delivering meals from a central kitchen to the 38 residential homes that comprise the facility.

Ludeman has been hit harder than the other 13 state-operated residential and hospital sites that care for people with developmental disabilities and mental health needs. As of Thursday, 155 of its 344 residents had tested positive, with 91 awaiting results. The rest tested negative.

Officials say most of those residents haven’t had any symptoms, and there’s hope the worst has passed.

It’s a brighter picture than what’s happening in nursing homes around the state, where the death toll is much higher for similarly situated residents — though advocates say the state isn’t reporting COVID data on thousands of disabled individuals in private, nonprofit residential facilities that are state-licensed.

Sixty-eight of 892 Ludeman employees have tested positive, but union officials say testing has been limited. They’re pressing to get tests offered onsite for all workers. The state is working to do that, a spokesperson said.

While my heart goes out to everyone at Ludeman affected by the outbreak, I’m concentrating on the staff in part because it’s difficult to imagine the terror that would come from seeing three coworkers drop dead in two weeks.

“There’s no question they’re concerned,” said Anne Irving, who works with Ludeman’s staff as regional director of AFSCME Council 31.

Irving said that concern is directed as much as anything toward the residents, with whom they’ve developed deep relationships.

Caring for developmentally disabled people is demanding in the best of times, heroic in a pandemic. These are jobs that do not allow for social distancing.

Most Ludeman residents have serious medical conditions or severe behavioral problems in addition to developmental disabilities. More than half are nonverbal.

That means hands-on work for the staff that can include feeding and bathing residents and helping them get dressed in addition to keeping them engaged and entertained to help pass time under quarantine.

Many residents don’t understand the need to be isolated in their rooms because of the highly infectious disease, said Sarah Ross, whose younger sister Kathy has lived at Ludeman for 34 of the past 37 years.

“They are the angels and heroes of this community,” Ross said of Ludeman’s staff.

Abernathy had started her job last fall after 20 years as an investigator for the state Department of Children and Family Services, looking out for abused and neglected children.

“I could see the love she had for these individuals,” said Jones, who started dating Abernathy after training her for the position.

With a bachelor’s degree from Chicago State and master’s from Sparta College, Abernathy was very involved with her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, but always made time to watch the Bears — and Dallas Cowboys — play, Jones said.

They lived together in Chatham and planned to get engaged.

I wish I could tell you more about Velez and Lee, but I don’t know much. Velez worked for the agency for 30 years. Lee, 59, formerly of Markham, was there less than two years.

Ross said Ludeman has a continuing need for masks, gloves and gowns because the staff goes through so much each day. She asked me to plead for donations.

“At times, it seems we are a forgotten community,” she said.

He was 48.

The newspaper reported Causi’s death on its website Sunday night and included an image of Monday’s back page. It featured a photo of Causi holding a camera with a long lens and the words “Our Eyes, Our Heart” and then below: “And our city’s loss.”

Causi was married with two young children. Many of New York’s professional teams and several players posted messages on Twitter expressing sadness, condolences and paying tribute to him.

“Do you know how many athletes reached out when they heard he was sick?” said Stephen Lynch, editor-in-chief at the Post. “Players from every team, sending thoughts, hoping he was going to be all right.”

Major League Baseball called Causi a “sports photojournalist extraordinaire” and said he “brought out the best in the players and the people of our National Pastime.”

Causi was a smiling and friendly fixture at venues from Yankee Stadium to Madison Square Garden and others all over the New York area. His action shots often popped impressively on The Post’s sports pages, and he was well-liked not only by media colleagues but also the famous players he chronicled.

“What a great man. So sorry to hear,” tweeted Texas Rangers infielder Todd Frazier, who played for both the Yankees and Mets. “God found his angel photographer that’s for sure.”

Curtis Granderson, former Yankees and Mets outfielder, wrote: “New York baseball won’t be the same without him in the photo pit.”

Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Didi Gregorius, who played for the Yankees from 2015-19: “Anthony was a great, funny and awesome guy to talk to and learn from about sports photography ... may he Rest In Peace.”

Lynch called Causi “a brilliant journalist.”

“He was, quite simply, one of the best sports photographers in New York City, capturing all the major moments of the past 25 years. Soft-spoken, funny, but most of all kind — he was respected by those he photographed and admired by those with whom he worked,” Lynch said.

“The Post that you read, and the newsroom that we work in, are less colorful today because of his absence. Our hearts go out to his family, and we share their grief.”

Causi was born and raised in Brooklyn and he graduated from Pace University. He joined The Post in 1994 as a photo messenger before advancing to photo editor and then full-time journalist photographer, the newspaper said.

His uncle, Joe Causi, an on-air personality for WCBS-FM Radio, said his nephew often took photos at Little League events pro bono, the Post said.

The Post said Causi is survived by his wife, Romina, and their children, John, 5, and Mia, 2, as well as his parents, Lucille and John Causi, and sisters Maria Marangelli and Dianna Marotto.",real

One in four people in England who died with COVID-19 also had diabetes, according to data from the National Health Service.

The NHS report published Thursday broke down the underlying conditions of the 22,332 individuals who died of the coronavirus in hospitals in England between March 31 and May 12, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes was the leading comorbidity with 5,873 people, amounting to 26%, The Guardian reported.

The report did not differentiate how many fatalities occurred in those who also had type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

After diabetes, other common underlying conditions include ""dementia (18%), serious breathing problems (15%) and chronic kidney disease (14%). One in ten (10%) suffered from ischaemic heart disease,"" according to The Guardian report.

199,72,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-in-europe-by-the-numbers/,2020-03-13,Coronavirus in Europe: Live data tracker,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

The inaugural Pride South Side Festival in 2019 sought to create “sustainable spaces for queer youth of color on the South Side” with a series of events spanning five South Side neighborhoods, but organizers said they started pivoting to an online celebration for its second year when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Chicago area.

Now, they’re launching an online hub for LGBTQ people of color to share artwork, as well as a two-month-long campaign encouraging LGBTQ South and West siders to complete the 2020 Census.

“In the time of social distancing, so many folks who already exist at the margins can be pushed even further into isolation, putting the mental health and well-being of our community into jeopardy,” said Dio Aldridge, director of program development for Pride South Side. “What our team set out to do is create a safe, affirming and entertaining online space that serves as a platform for black, queer or Latinx artists and content creators from the South and West sides of Chicago.”

Aldridge said this year’s campaign will focus on the same goals outlined at last year’s festival: to create space for LGBTQ people outside of the North Side, promote health and wellness and support their local economy.

In a video promoting Pride South Side’s campaign, participating artists explain how census participation can benefit LGBTQ South Siders.

“What the census hopes to provide is to get a sort of idea what your population is looking like, so you can better understand how to allocate resources,” one artist says.

Results from the 2020 Census will affect how federal funding is allocated each year.

Pride South Side has partnered with Chicago-based LGBTQ artists Vicki Street, DJ Doza the God, Roy Kinsey, Melli Domo and Kelsey Stone to provide Chicagoans with new artwork and resources every day from May 1 through June 30, which is the end of LGBTQ Pride Month.

The group, which now also partners with the 2020 Census and the Illinois Department of Human Services, hopes to reach at least 6,000 people through its online campaign and raise at least $100,000 in sales for local LGBTQ artists and the Brave Space Alliance, a South Side LGBTQ Center that’s launched a COVID-19 food delivery drive.

“It is nothing short of amazing how our team has come together and the artist community we’ve been able to cultivate for this project. We are hype and ready for what’s to come,” Aldridge said.

The announcement comes days after the city’s annual LGBTQ Pride Parade and festival were postponed until the fall due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Tim Frye, coordinator of the 2020 parade, said the event will either be rescheduled until the fall or return in 2021 and “for years to come.”

The devastating toll of coronavirus is far-reaching, but the impact of the pandemic is particularly acute among black Americans and Latinos, who are nearly three times as likely to personally know someone who has died from the virus than white Americans, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday.

Thirty percent of black adults and 26% of Latino adults in the country said they know a victim of the coronavirus, who died either from the disease or from complications related to the virus. For white adults, the corresponding figure is 10%.

The findings are consistent with local and national data reported by states and cities and reviewed by ABC News that revealed racial and ethnic minorities suffer a disproportionate share of the negative health and economic outcomes from the coronavirus pandemic.

For example, in New York City, the site of one of the worst hot spots in the country, black Americans and Latinos are two times more likely to be hospitalized and to die from COVID-19 than whites.

In Louisiana, although black residents only comprise a third of the population, they accounted for 70% of the deaths in the state, as of last month.

The new poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos’ Knowledge Panel, comes as the death toll approaches 100,000 and confirmed cases of COVID-19 top 1.5 million in the country. All 50 states have at least partially reopened this week, ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, as President Donald Trump continues his push to revive the economy amid the continued risk of the pandemic.

Do you personally know anyone who has died from the coronavirus or from complications related to the coronavirus, or not? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

As testing across the country increases and becomes more available, overwhelming majorities of Americans are confident they both know where to get tested and can access testing for the virus.

Among all Americans, 77% said they are confident that they would know where to go for testing if they suspected they had been infected. Additionally, 71% of Americans said they are confident they could get tested if they needed to.

Majorities across racial groups are confident they would know where to go for testing and think they could successfully get tested. However, racial disparities are more apparent when looking at those who express a high level of confidence. Whites are more likely to say they are very confident they would know where to go for testing (46%) than are blacks (29%) and Hispanics (35%). Similarly, whites are more likely to say they are very confident they would be able to get tested (38%) compared to blacks (25%) and Hispanics (25%).

This report is part of ""Pandemic – A Nation Divided,"" ABC News' special coverage of the heightened racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Tune into ""Nightline"" for a three-day series this week, 12 a.m. ET on ABC.

Disparate views on testing confidence also emerge by party affiliation, especially when singling out Americans who said they are very confident about knowing where to go to get tested and having a test administered.

In the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, only 31% of Democrats and 36% of independents said they are very confident they knew where to get tested for the coronavirus if they needed to be, but 57% of Republicans said the same.

And when it comes to being tested, 29% of independents and 23% of Democrats said they are very confident that they could be tested if needed, compared to 52% of Republicans who said the same.

Trump has repeatedly touted the nation’s testing capabilities, saying the United States has the “best testing in the world” and is “doing more testing than anybody else.” But high profile Democrats have said the opposite, including the Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, whose home state of New York is one of the hardest-hit states throughout this pandemic.

During an interview on ABC’s ""The View"" Thursday, Schumer said testing ""has been one of the greatest failures of this administration” and that he hopes “they learn from it.""

The latest survey, capping two months of polling on the coronavirus, shows Trump’s underwater approval hitting a new low, as the country is as uneasy as ever about contracting the disease.

Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling the response to the coronavirus (COVID-19)? ABC News/Ipsos Poll

Only 39% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the crisis - driven, largely, by waning support among independents - compared to 60% who disapprove. Just over one-third of independents (35%) approve of the president’s response to the coronavirus, a dip from one month ago, when 42% of independents approved.

In that same poll, released on April 17, 44% of Americans approved of Trump’s management of the pandemic, compared to 54% who disapproved. His newest marks are also a sharp decline from mid-March when his approval stood at 55%.

Trump’s approval is fiercely split by partisanship, with 7% of Democrats and 89% of Republicans approving of the president, while 92% of Democrats and 11% of Republicans disapprove.

Even as every state moves steadily towards reopening, Americans are not confident that the country is out of the woods when it comes to the deadly virus.

Over three in four Americans are concerned about contracting the coronavirus, while 22% remain not concerned.

Those concerns trace along both racial and party lines. Black Americans (87%) and Latinos (85%) are more concerned about getting the virus than whites (73%), with slightly more than half of blacks Americans (51%) and Latinos (52%) saying they are very concerned about the threat compared to 27% of whites.

Democrats (94%) are far more likely than Republicans (59%) to be concerned about becoming infected, including 51% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans who say they are very concerned.

Still, only 6% of Democrats and less than half of Republicans (41%) say they are not concerned, including only 1% of Democrats and 11% of Republicans who are not concerned at all.

Now he can pop into position group meetings and rookie minicamp sessions, his head floating in a box on the computer screens of his players scattered around the country.

He has found a quiet place in his house and joked that the video game “Fortnite” has done a good job keeping his four sons, ages 12 to 16, occupied.

To spice up meetings, Nagy has guest speakers on so his players don’t tune out the sound of their own coaches’ voice.

He schedules on “Bears Time” — what the clock says in Chicago — but it’s confusing to navigate how time-zone differences affect players training from the West Coast to Florida.

“That’s the biggest obstacle,” he said.

Except for an even bigger one. There remains the existential question about the months ahead — one that’s familiar to businesses across the country during the coronavirus shutdown.

“Here’s probably what the biggest difficulty is, the unknown,” he said Friday. “That’s what’s hard. We’re sitting here, you go through trying to figure out what’s going to happen, whether it be at training camp, whether it be at preseason, the regular season. There’s a lot of unknowns there. That’s OK. We can’t control that. Let’s control what we can control.”

While some NFL teams have considered backup training-camp locations because of state stay-at-home orders, Nagy wouldn’t say if the Bears, who are slated to practice at Halas Hall, were of the same mind.

“Again, that’s one of the unknowns for us. If and when that does happen, we just have to react to it,” he said. “It just seems like every state’s a little different. The league is trying to figure out what to do and whatever they tell us, we’ll do. We’ve been so entrenched in this other stuff.”

Asked whether there will be games in home stadiums this year, Nagy again pled ignorance.

“You’re going to probably say, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s coach talk, I don’t believe you,’ ” he said. “But I’m telling you when I tell you this — I have no clue. Whatever they tell us to do, we’ll do.

“We’re just rolling with them and with what they say. We’re staying positive, and we’re just worrying about what the next solution is for whatever they tell us.”

The Bears held a rookie minicamp last week and a voluntary veteran minicamp in late April and early May. The next step of the virtual offseason program, OTAs, start later this month. They’ll feature more full-team meetings, though Nagy has remained flexible based on player feedback.

“You can take everything we’ve done in prior years,” Nagy said, “and you can just throw it out the window.”

Still, he’s trying to embrace what makes this offseason unique.

“There’s been some silver linings,” he said.

Even before the shutdown, the Bears planned to hold more position meetings, believing that installing the offense the last two years robbed their players of more detailed instruction. Nagy pops into them virtually; at Halas Hall, he couldn’t go from room-to-room so quickly.

There’s more time to chat without on-field work, so Bears coaches are getting to know players through what Nagy calls “coffee shops” — virtual meetings to talk about life outside football.

As for the playbook, Nagy said his assistant coaches are offering detailed instruction. That appeals to one of his favorite mantras.

“I love ‘over-communicate clarity’ — I use that all the time,” Nagy said. “What better way? . . . There’s no excuse now.”",real

Twila Boyd, a pharmacist in South Charleston, Ohio, explains what it's like to treat patients in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

We've been hearing from health care workers of all kinds as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. Now a pharmacist, Twila Boyd - she owns the Charleston Pharmacy in South Charleston, Ohio, a town of about a thousand people. She joins us from her home now. Thanks very much for being with us.

TWILA BOYD: Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

SIMON: How have your days changed? - a whole lot busier?

BOYD: (Laughter) On Monday, we saw a 50% spike in our pharmacy volume. And it's continued the rest of this week - people trying to get their medications early or trying to get multiple months filled of their medications. So yes, it's been very interesting.

SIMON: Can you help them?

BOYD: Yes, we can. What we're trying to tell people - that if they just normally get a 30-day supply of their medication, it's best if they continue with that pattern. If you have people stockpiling, then that doesn't leave as much or anything left for the other ones later on. So it's like the grocery stores. But right now, we have medications. And we're doing fine. We're able to get things in. It may take us a couple of days to get something that we need. But we are able to get it in.

SIMON: People working for you - overextended, extra hours, extra stress?

BOYD: I think this is a very stressful time because a lot of their friends maybe are working from home, and they're feeling the stress of dealing with the population where somebody might be a carrier that doesn't have any symptoms. But right now, they're doing very well. There's a lot of cookies and cupcakes that are being brought in. And the people that come in are bringing - some of them will bring health cleaning supplies. So that's nice.

SIMON: Do you have any masks?

BOYD: No, we do not have any masks. We do have gloves. I do have a delivery driver that goes out every day Monday through Friday. And he does wear gloves. And he has a mask. So he can wear those no problem because he is dealing with the elderly. He's dealing with children or, you know, families. So he is trying to have minimal contact with them.

SIMON: Do you get new protocols all the time?

BOYD: Every day - yes, we do. The one that is really good is that we do not have to have everybody sign with either the pen pad with the pen or their finger. So we don't have people touching the machine constantly or one right after the other. Then other things - it's telling us that if you have the elderly, pregnant or somebody that is sick, if they come into the pharmacy, they would be waited on immediately. And then they would be ushered out of the pharmacy once they get their medication. So we don't really have anybody that sits in the pharmacy and waits for their medication. Most of the people just drop their prescriptions off and are leaving the pharmacy. So that is also good.

SIMON: Well, I guess we should note that Charleston Pharmacy - South Charleston, Ohio - is open for business.

BOYD: Yes, it is (laughter). Yes, it is. We are open. And it's always nice that - if you have a pharmacy - that you are familiar with the pharmacist, that if you have questions, you can call them, or you can talk to them. At this point, they're really very busy. And most of them are understaffed.

SIMON: Yeah.

BOYD: But during regular periods of time, if you have questions, you could always talk to the pharmacist because we are a wealth of knowledge. And we can certainly help you. Since we're usually the first ones - if someone is feeling sick...

SIMON: Yeah.

BOYD: ...They usually go to the pharmacy first. So if you think you might have it, we could help you with deciding whether you do have either the COVID-19, the flu or they just have a cold or if it's just allergy season. So we do see a lot of people coming in with runny noses right now.

SIMON: Twila Boyd owns and operates the Charleston Pharmacy - South Charleston, Ohio. Thanks very much. Good luck to you.

BOYD: Thank you very much.

The electric-vehicle maker announced the provision along with plans to reinstate its attendance policy starting Friday. Employees who are concerned they might expose an at-risk member of their household can sign and submit a document to take leave until May 31, Valerie Capers Workman, Tesla’s head of North American human resources, wrote in the memo viewed by Bloomberg News.

Workers who Tesla or a doctor have told to quarantine, or have Covid-19 symptoms or have tested positive for the coronavirus are not subject to the attendance policy, Capers Workman said. Her memo applied to workers at the company’s auto plant in Fremont, California, and its battery factory near Reno, Nevada.

Tesla restarted production at the Fremont facility last week in defiance of a county shutdown order. Days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the company would breach local rules and that he was willing to risk arrest, Tesla told employees the county’s health official had approved its safety plans and procedures.

On Wednesday, Tesla abandoned the lawsuit the company filed 11 days earlier against the county over its health order.

232,1017,https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/5/15/21258894/lori-lightfoot-anniversary-coronavirus-pandemic,2020-05-15,Lightfoot’s ‘helluva’ first year culminates in pandemic that will define her tenure,"No matter how long it lasts or what else she says and does, Lori Lightfoot’s tenure as mayor of Chicago will be defined by the coronavirus.

Shutting down the lakefront. Cutting off citywide liquor sales. Driving around the city to personally break up large gatherings, inspiring a hilarious string of memes that softened her hard edges.

Her self-declared war on poverty made infinitely more difficult in black and Hispanic neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of the layoffs and deaths.

The stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy that will blow a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget. The strike-shortened school year cut even shorter. And a Chicago City Council rebellion that gained steam during the mayor’s 29-to-21 fight for emergency contracting and spending authority.

“If she is able to guide us through this incredibly difficult time and Chicago emerges stronger, she is going to be viewed historically as one of the city’s greatest mayors,” said former Ald. Joe Moore (49th). “But, boy, it is daunting.”

Democratic political consultant Peter Giangreco said the “most important measure of any executive is to show strong leadership” during a crisis, and Lightfoot has “hit that one out of the park.

“She’s got to keep leveling with people,” said Giangreco, who advised Susana Mendoza’s losing mayoral campaign against Lightfoot. “She’s at her best when she’s telling people inconvenient truths.”

Wednesday will mark the one-year anniversary of Lightfoot’s historic inauguration as the first African American female and first openly gay mayor of Chicago.

“It’s been a helluva year,” Lightfoot told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Nobody comes into office thinking they’re gonna have to deal with a pandemic before they even hit their one-year anniversary… It’s been a humbling experience.

“I’m not gonna say that there haven’t been days where I shed a tear. I have. I’ve wept for the loss. I’ve wept for the hardship that so many people are suffering. But I know that they rely upon me to…pick myself up and get back into the fight every single day.”

It seems forever ago that Lightfoot used her inaugural address to portray the city council as corrupt, stripped aldermen of their “prerogative” over licensing and permitting in their wards and used her first council meeting to humiliate now-indicted Ald. Edward Burke (14th).

Since then, Lightfoot has been faced with so many controversies that she jokingly has compared herself to the central character in the bible’s Book of Job.

She erased what she said was an $838 million shortfall — without a massive property tax increase — by balancing her $11.6 billion budget with assumptions and one-time revenues.

During the budget battle, Lightfoot angrily accused ride-hailing giant Uber of “paying off” black ministers with an offer of $54 million to kill her $40 million congestion fee. The unsubstantiated charge offended the ministers, a powerful political force.

After the council vote, the mayor again showed how intolerant she is to dissent. She used her political action committee to shame the 11 aldermen who dared to vote against a budget they said “woefully underfunds” affordable housing and mental health.

Lightfoot also endured an 11-day teachers strike that ended, only after she lost the public relations battle to a machine-like Chicago Teachers Union and essentially gave away the store to the union that backed her vanquished opponent Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president.

The end came only after Lightfoot removed the line she had stubbornly drawn in the sand by compensating teachers for five of the 11 days they had spent on strike. Still, the six-day pay cut so infuriated CTU leaders that they refused to stand with the mayor when the agreement was announced. Bitterness from that episode still lingers on both sides.

The firing of police Supt. Eddie Johnson was another key moment in Lightfoot’s first year. Even after Johnson was found slumped over the wheel of his police SUV near his Bridgeport home — and told the mayor that happened after he had dinner and drinks with friends — Lightfoot allowed Johnson to announce his own retirement and held a celebratory news conference in his honor.

A few weeks later, a livid Lightfoot fired Johnson after accusing the superintendent she inherited of “lying to me and lying to the public” about the circumstances surrounding the Oct. 17, 2019, incident. She got even with a vengeance, placing Johnson on City Hall’s do-not-hire list.

To David Greising, the Better Government Association’s president and chief executive officer, the ugly firing of one of Chicago’s most popular police superintendents showed Lightfoot “maturing” on the job.

“She went from being doubtful he could do the job to learning she needed to rely on him through the summer, then deciding he wasn’t the person going forward, yet trusting his first version of what happened at the asleep-behind-the-wheel-of-a-parked-car episode to then being lied to and, in a pique, saying more than she needed to about what had gone on there,” Greising said. “It was not her finest hour.”

Garry McCarthy, the former police superintendent-turned-mayoral candidate, doesn’t care about the circuitous path Lightfoot took to get rid of Johnson. What matters to McCarthy is she ended up in the right place.

“You can’t hold police officers accountable for lying and not hold the police chief accountable for the same thing,” he said.

Johnson’s firing hastened the arrival of retired Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck, a policing heavyweight lured by Lightfoot’s public safety gravitas.

Beck didn’t just sit there. Taking on the dirty work, he ended merit promotions and engineered a massive police shakeup while running things until the arrival of former Dallas police Chief David Brown.

The manner in which Lightfoot got her choice, in Brown, generated its own controversy. A former Chicago Police Board president whose recommendations were ignored by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Lightfoot said the selection process “only has legitimacy if you follow it.”

Lightfoot had her eye on Brown from the moment she fired Johnson. She chose Brown one day after the board made public its list of three finalists and made certain the other two finalists had nowhere near Brown’s experience so that the choice would appear obvious. It was hardly the “transparency” she had promised.

Before returning to Los Angeles, Beck said there were “two pandemics that face Chicago — and only one of them is virus-induced.”

Now, Brown is on the clock to find a solution for the pandemic induced by gangs and gun violence.

“The courts are effectively closed,” Lightfoot said. “The jail is closed. Our federal partners that we rely upon are at home and not doing what they normally do from a criminal justice standpoint. Our Chicago Police Department is standing effectively alone. And guess what? They’re human beings. They’ve been getting sick. Some have died.

“Trying to figure out how you police in this really difficult environment is the challenge of a lifetime. I joked with David Brown the other day. I called and said, ‘I hope you’re not heading back to Dallas.’ ”

The April 11 demolition debacle in Little Village triggered, yet another controversy, this one at the worst possible time.

Armed with a city demolition permit that Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) tried to block, a subcontractor hired by Hilco Redevelopment Partners demolished a 95-year-old smokestack at the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant without abiding by the safety measures it had promised to implement.

A giant plume of dust rained down on the community, making it difficult to breathe during a coronavirus pandemic that does the same.

Desperate to minimize the political fallout, Lightfoot blamed Hilco, slapped the company with $68,000 in fines and vowed to overhaul the city’s regulatory system. She also denied that her executive order stripping aldermen of control over licensing and permitting had set the stage for the demolition disaster and lashed out at aldermen who said otherwise.

Council members who pushed back against Lightfoot’s request for expanded spending and contracting authority for the duration of the pandemic similarly were denounced as “shameful,” “selfish” grandstanders willing to put politics over public health.

Lightfoot got her way after a 29-to-21 vote not seen since the 1980’s power struggle known as Council Wars that saw 29 aldermen, most of them white, thwart former Mayor Harold Washington’s every move.

But the close vote and thin-skinned prelude to it signals trouble may be ahead when the shutdown ends and painful, budget-balancing decisions begin.

“She is willing to put opponents in their place in order to make a point about the power dynamic between her and her opponent,” Greising said. “Does she do that to make an important point, as she did in her smackdown of Ed Burke? Or does she just do that to kind of show off in a way that’s not constructive?

“If she has unnecessarily dismissed people or embarrassed them or called into question their value as representatives of their wards, has she cost herself in terms of being able to advance her agenda?”

Apparently referring to earlier skirmishes with aldermen over aldermanic prerogative, recreational marijuana and gay setasides, Moore agreed that Lightfoot “has to do a better job of relating to the city council” because her “margin for error is diminishing.

“Clearly, there are lot more socialists and uber-left progressives who are gonna vote against her no matter what because she is adopting a very pragmatic governing style,” he said. “But a few of those 21 votes were — based on my conversations with my former colleagues — just aldermen who feel like they’re being disrespected.

“That would be the one area that…she needs improvement on. But, overall, ironically, she’s governing in the same pragmatic style as Rahm Emanuel. She may not like the comparison, but it’s very similar in terms of policy. The only difference is Rahm…did a very good job of building relationships with members of the city council, [and it showed] when they were called upon to cast difficult votes.”

Former Ald. Pat O’Connor (40th), who was Emanuel’s floor leader, said the council “could become a growing problem” for Lightfoot but not until life in Chicago returns to some semblance of normalcy.

“If you’ve got a life-threatening infection, you’re not worried about the fact you’ve got a hangnail somewhere,” O’Connor said. “She’s not gonna worry about what she needs from them until she needs it, while she can do the things with the pandemic that she’s got to do.”

Until the pandemic brought normal life to a halt, Lightfoot’s biggest concern was her war on poverty and her plan to target 10 inner-city neighborhoods for an unprecedented $250 million city investment and $500 million more from other government agencies.

She delivered a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a predictable scheduling ordinance — signature victories for organized labor. She pushed through the first installment of her plan to go easier on scofflaws.

But she still was being pressured from the left to deliver civilian police review, a police contract that makes it easier to discipline officers and more money for the homeless and affordable housing.

Now, COVID-19 occupies nearly every waking moment for Lightfoot and makes intransigent problems worse.

“The vulnerabilities of our city — poverty, the lack of access to health care, disparities in investment and jobs — those vulnerabilities are flashing like a neon sign every single day,” the mayor said.

“Black people are dying at an absolutely unfathomably high rate. Now, we’re seeing this huge surge of cases in the Latinx community…We’ve got to speed up the work. We don’t have the time to contemplate and think great thoughts.”

Jacky Grimshaw, who was one of Washington’s closest advisers, said Lightfoot “bit the bullet to do something that other mayors, really since Harold,” wouldn’t, confronting “inequities in the city and the way services are delivered.”

One element of that was appointing a chief equity officer.

Grimshaw said Lightfoot’s nonbinding “Housing Solidarity Pledge” was a disappointment and that she’s worried about a spike in foreclosures, evictions and homelessness tied to the coronavirus unless there is real rent relief.

But she said, “Maybe this was the best deal she could get. At least, she was trying to get something in terms of relief, even though it didn’t go far enough.”

Grimshaw was particularly impressed with the stay-at-home public service announcements engineered by marketing guru Michael Fassnacht. They have turned Lightfoot into an international celebrity.

“It wasn’t her doing in terms of creating the memes,” said Grimshaw, vice president for government affairs at the Center for Neighborhood Technology. “But she had the right person ….to help her, and she was willing to take his suggestions.

“She understood that it was a harsh thing to cut off the lakefront, and you couldn’t just be mean about it. You had to try and give people an understanding of why you had to make the decisions you made.”

Lightfoot’s tough-love message is not getting through to millennials, though. They have continued to party, oblivious to the stay-at-home order. That’s likely to only get worse as temperatures rise and the lakefront remains closed.

She has been criticized for strolling up to a playground and lecturing African American men playing basketball during the pandemic.

Chicago’s steely-eyed mayor makes no apologies. She said she is just trying to be “who I am: strong and steady.”

Lightfoot said it’s been a “different year than I would have predicted,” but she “wouldn’t trade a second of it — except for the loss of life.

“Not just from the pandemic,” she said. “The loss of life for gun violence. That still haunts me.”",real
234,146,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/science/viruses-coranavirus-biology.html,2020-03-24,Welcome to the Virosphere,"
In January, Chinese virologists isolated the virus that causes Covid-19. Earlier this month, a team of virologists gave this new virus a new name: SARS-CoV-2.
To do so, they had to move the virus to the head of a very, very long line.In recent years, scientists have discovered that the world of virus diversity — what they sometimes call the virosphere — is unimaginably vast. They have uncovered hundreds of thousands of new species that have yet to be named. And they suspect that there are millions, perhaps even trillions, of species waiting to be found.
“Suffice to say that we have only sampled a minuscule fraction of the virosphere,” said Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney in Australia.
With the discovery of viruses in the late 1800s, scientists soon recognized that different species caused different diseases — rabies and influenza, for example. Later, virologists learned how to recognize new kinds of viruses by growing them in labs, where subtler biological features emerged.
After decades of this painstaking work, virologists have officially named 6,828 species of viruses; the figure includes 1,000 or so that will be formally accepted in the next few weeks by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. That’s a paltry count when you consider that entomologists have named 380,000 species of beetles alone.
But in recent years, virologists have changed the way they hunt. Now they look for bits of genetic material in samples — water, mud, blood — and use sophisticated computer programs to recognize viral genes.
Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, has used this method to search for viruses that infect life in the ocean. He and his colleagues analyzed genetic material in seawater collected on a scientific voyage around the world. Some genes belonged to species already known to science. But many were new. In 2016, Dr. Sullivan and his colleagues reported over 15,000 viruses, each representing a new species.
That was more than twice as many species as all the previously identified viruses. And with that, Dr. Sullivan thought he and his colleagues had pretty much finished off the diversity of viruses in the sea. But they went on collecting more water, and invented new ways to search it for the genetic material of viruses. In 2019, they reported finding a total of 200,000 species.
“I’ve stopped saying, ‘We’re done,’” Dr. Sullivan said.Other researchers are discovering thousands of new viruses as well. “Right now, we are in the exponential phase,” said Dr. Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland. “If someone gives me a million dollars and I go out and sample sea cucumbers, I will present you with 10,000 new viruses.”
Formally describing a new virus remains a time-consuming task. When Chinese researchers isolated the Covid-19-causing virus earlier this year, they found that it had a distinctive crown of proteins. This hallmark told them that the virus belonged to the coronavirus family, which contains 39 known species. The World Health Organization used this finding to give the disease its name — Coronavirus Disease 2019, or Covid-19 for short.
To determine just what kind of coronavirus they were dealing with, virologists sequenced its genes. The virus was genetically similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak in 2002. In March, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses declared that the two viruses belonged to the same species. The virus that caused SARS is known as SARS-CoV. So they called the Covid-19-causing virus SARS-CoV-2.
The viruses that infect humans are the best understood of all. But only about 250 species of viruses choose us as their host — “an insignificant fraction of the virosphere infect humans,” Dr. Holmes said.
While hundreds of thousands of new species still await their own names, virologists believe that far more await discovery. Dr. Holmes estimates that the viruses infecting animals, plants, fungi and protozoans (a group called eukaryotes) number 100 million species.
Bacteria and other single-celled microbes belong to a group called prokaryotes. In a paper published on March 4 in Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues argued that there are, at minimum, 100 million species of viruses that infect prokaryotes.
But some researchers suspect there are many more species of prokaryotes in the world — which would mean many more species of viruses. The true figure might be as high as 10 trillion.
For each of those species, scientists will have to figure out how it is related to other viruses. That is far harder to determine for viruses than for familiar life-forms like animals and plants.
Scientists who study animals and plants can rely on the tried and true classification system first established by Carl Linnaeus in the 1700s. Our species belongs to the class Mammalia, for instance, and, above that, the animal kingdom. Virologists have struggled to figure out the classes and kingdoms of the virosphere. Part of the problem is that viruses have a penchant for trading genes with other species, making it hard to draw bright lines between groups of them.
And very often, a new virus simply makes no sense. An extreme example came to light in February when scientists searching for viruses in a lake found a new one they named Yaravirus. Of Yaravirus’s 74 genes, 68 are unlike any ever found in any virus.
In recent years, Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues have sought to tame this chaos. They have developed what they call a “megataxonomy” to classify viruses that seems to work. The team sorted viruses based on whether they carried one or more of a few “hallmark genes.” They also looked for groups of species that trade genes among each other, and less so with other groups.
“A coherent account of the global organization of the virus world is now within reach,” they wrote in their new paper. Dr. Kuhn, in an interview, said, “We were all a bit surprised this system is so logical in the end.”
Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues submitted their system to the taxonomy committee, and he said it would likely be accepted soon. Still, the megataxonomy is far from complete. Yaravirus, for instance, still floats on its own, lonely and unclassifiable.
Some researchers are skeptical about the megataxonomy. Dr. Holmes thinks it is too soon to attempt one, given that researchers have found so few viruses. “Why build something so rigid when it may just fall as we sample more?” he asked. Dr. Kuhn argues that it’s worth starting to build a system, even if it needs to be adjusted later.
Making sense of the virosphere is not just an intellectually challenging puzzle, Dr. Kuhn said. At Fort Dietrick, he runs experiments on some of the world’s most dangerous viruses, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the virosphere could help him and his colleagues come up with ways to combat these threats and others we don’t even know about yet.

The US could finally be free of the coronavirus in late September, and the whole world can expect to put the pandemic behind them in December, say scientists in Singapore.

The rosy forecasts are from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, where researchers are using artificial intelligence to continually update their charting of the pandemic’s “life cycle” by country.

At the end of April, predictions showed that the US would be virus-free by Sept. 20 and the UK could see the end of the coronavirus by Aug. 27, Metro.co.uk reported Saturday.

But the group has since taken down its country-by-country charts from its website — instead posting a disclaimer that the research was strictly for educational purposes and may contain errors.

Scientists at the university caution that their results are continually evolving and inexact– and that the predictions should not lead to hasty ends of lockdowns around the world.

“Over-optimism based on some predicted end dates is dangerous because it may loosen our disciplines and controls and cause the turnaround of the virus,” they said.",fake

The labels should make it easier tell if a tweet has a misleading or unverified claim and point you toward resources about COVID-19.

The new labels will link to a page curated by Twitter or to an “external trusted source” that can provide information about the claims made in the tweet, according to Twitter. Here’s what the new labels look like:

Twitter may also apply a warning onto a tweet if it conflicts with COVID-19 guidance from public health experts. That warning will cover the tweet with a message from Twitter, and to see the actual tweet, you’ll need to specifically click into it. Here is what that warning looks like:

The company also laid out a rubric for how it will evaluate taking action on a tweet with false or misleading content across three different categories and based on the tweet’s “propensity for harm.” Here’s that rubric:

Twitter started applying a new label to tweets “containing synthetic and manipulated media” as of February of this year. Twitter has also pledged to remove misleading COVID-19-related tweets that could incite people to engage in what it deems “harmful activity.”",real

New figures for England and Wales brought the death toll to at least 42,990, a Reuters tally showed, including earlier data from Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well recent hospital deaths in England.

Tuesday’s numbers from the Office for National Statistics painted a grim picture in care homes, more than a third of which have been stricken by the novel coronavirus.

Deaths in care homes across the United Kingdom topped 10,000 as of May 8, although the increase has slowed over the last couple of weeks.

Comparisons with other countries are tricky, but the data confirmed Britain was among those hit worst by the pandemic , which has killed more than 317,000 worldwide.

Such a high UK death toll increases the pressure on Johnson, who says the government is following scientific advice. Opposition parties say he was slow to introduce testing and provide protective equipment to health workers, and that his policy left care homes exposed.

In March, Britain’s chief scientific adviser said keeping deaths below 20,000 would be a “good outcome”. In April, Reuters reported the government’s worst-case scenario was 50,000 deaths.

Unlike the daily death toll announced by the government, Tuesday’s ONS figures include suspected deaths from COVID-19.

Ministers dislike international comparisons of the death toll because Britain’s performance reflects its fast reporting of COVID-19 deaths data.

They say excess mortality - deaths from all causes that exceed the seasonal average - is more meaningful because it is internationally comparable. But Britain is faring poorly on this measure, too.

Excess deaths across the UK are now close to 55,000, ONS statistician Nick Stripe told the BBC.",real

You think you’re young and invincible — so why wear the mask?","Hey, I get it, I really do. You’re young, you’re healthy and you think you’re invincible, so masks are unnecessary except at Halloween parties with a lame medical theme.

Every afternoon around 4 o’clock, I walk the dog. She needs to maintain her relationship with fire hydrants, grass and foliage, and I desperately need to get out of the house. I am never without a mask, even though they fog up my glasses and I look like a befuddled, inappropriately dressed surgeon who got lost on his way to the OR.

Opinion

It seemed like quite a lot of you wore them at first, but gradually many of you stopped. I don’t know if this is because you’re unable to grasp the notion that their purpose is to protect others (and to an extent, you) or because the Insta vendors ran out of cool colors or because you’re too vain to allow a mask to obscure your Look-At-Me-I’m-Like-So-Hot-I-Can’t-Stand-It facial features.

Some of you even persist in walking down the middle of the sidewalk, so it is I who must scurry into the street to achieve the mandatory 6-foot distance. My dog isn’t wild about that either. She prefers grass to pavement.

As for you maskless joggers — do you not realize that your heavier than normal exhalations are sending a virtually continuous Hollywood spit take into the atmosphere? The sun is out, but it’s raining horizontally.

Here’s the thing. If one of you gives it to me, I could give it to five of your friends before I take that scenic ride in the COVID-19 freezer truck.

I used to think I was invincible too until I got a godawful case of the Swine Flu when I was 25 and spent a week crawling to the bathroom, eating carpet pile on the way and asking my friends if they knew any weed dealers who sold cyanide.

Guess what? COVID-19 is a LOT worse than Swine Flu. I know a 21-year-old guy — no health problems, works out, even eats kale — who got it, and he said the misery was so intense it felt like an invisible psychotic wearing steel-toed boots was kicking every inch of his body incessantly for two weeks while holding his head in a convection oven set on “BAKE.” Also, his lungs had made it clear that they would prefer to live outside of his body.

Here’s another unpleasant surprise for you. Where I live, in Los Angeles, almost three times as many people between 0 and 40 have been testing positive than the over-65 group. Sure, we senior types croak more often, but the rising ratios don’t look so great for you, either.

Which is not to say that my generation is perfect. Far from it. For starters, we destroyed the planet, which, granted, was kind of a screw-up. And those who occupy the seats in the cretin section of our age group don’t wear masks, either.

But most of us who do wear masks don’t think we’re invincible anymore, and we’ve been around long enough to know that you’re not, either. I realize it’s hard for a 20-year-old to imagine, but one day, just like us, the topics that will inevitably creep into your conversations will be about colonoscopies, MRIs and the heartbreak of psoriasis.

Granted, it’s wonderful to feel invincible. Cherish it while it lasts, but don’t push your luck — wear the damn mask.

“The harm children are facing is just as real a threat to them as is the coronavirus,” he said in a prepared weekly address.

Beutner added that state and federal governments “jumped into action” to support patients who became ill and pour funding to make sure hospitals were adequately funded and staffed.

“We are looking at the same challenge in public education and we need the same full-throated response to the education crisis which looms ahead,” he said. “Governments have established virus task forces and job task forces. Where’s the education task force?”

The announcement comes days after Gov. Gavin Newsom said that decline of state revenues could force the state to cut funding for K-12 by nearly 10%. A recent revenue and funding forest released earlier this month from the governor’s office found that K-12 school districts could see funding cut by more than $18 billion.

Beutner didn’t disclose how cuts would impact the district’s operations but said details would be available in the coming days and weeks.

The pandemic is taking a toll on many families who have been struggling financially, he said on Monday.

Before the outbreak hit, forcing schools to close about two months ago, 70% of families reported a household income of less than $50,000 and 35% less than $25,000, Beutner said. Recently, 57% of families reported that one or more individuals in their household have lost their job after the pandemic broke out.

“Most families were struggling to get by before this crisis and for more than half of them, their situation has gotten worse,” he said.

Nearly every LAUSD student is now participating in online learning, school officials announced last week, but “a login on a computer doesn’t necessarily mean a student is engaged and learning,” Beutner said. These days, teachers are being trained with the focus on shifting to keeping students engaged in their studies, he added.

The level of engagement in classrooms and schools varies a great deal, he said, as teachers from “all schools will continue to reach out to students and encourage them to participate, just as they would in a classroom.”

Beutner also discussed the efforts to assist students who are learning English. The district has nearly 100,000 English learners and their families have received materials with conversation skills, literacy and math in both English and Spanish, similar to those used in classrooms.

On Monday, the district released the results of a survey to study the needs of nearly 12,000 families in East Los Angeles completed in early May, which found that roughly 75% felt schools and the district are doing a good job handling the crisis, officials said. About 80% of the families are receiving help three or more times a week from schools, including homework and health care and food.

Beutner pointed out that the biggest challenge for families was access to the internet and technology, with 50% lacking reliable internet and 25% a device.",real
253,1442,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/19/walmart-earnings-economy-coronavirus/,2020-05-19,Sales soar at Walmart and Home Depot during the pandemic,"On the other side of the spectrum: Kohl’s. The department store chain posted a 41 percent drop revenue for the quarter, offering a stark reminder of how the pandemic is boosting some retailers while hastening the demise of others.



Consumer spending has dropped precipitously in the weeks since the pandemic took hold. U.S. retail sales fell a record 8.3 percent in March, then plunged 16.4 percent in April, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans stopped spending on clothing, furniture, housewares and other nonessentials.



Retailers temporarily closed more than 260,000 stores because of the coronavirus outbreak, all but bringing business to a halt for many companies that rely on in-store shoppers to drive the bulk of their sales. Four major retailers — J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores and J.C. Penney — have filed for bankruptcy this month, and analysts say they expect others to follow as more companies run out of cash and the economy continues to sour.

Pier 1, which had filed for bankruptcy weeks before the shutdowns, announced Tuesday it would cease operations altogether. It had planned to closed 450 of its 936 stores and shed 40 percent of its workforce and find a buyer, but the pandemic ended those hopes.



“It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: the bigger, stronger players are taking even more market share,” said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at the rating agency Moody’s. “And the companies that were weak to begin with, they are only going to become weaker.”



But spending on groceries has continued to climb. Walmart, the country’s largest grocer, said profits rose 4 percent, to $3.99 billion, during the first quarter. Demand has been so brisk that Walmart has hired more than 235,000 workers since mid-March, according to chief executive Doug McMillon. All 5,355 of the company’s U.S. stores have remained open during the pandemic.

“More than ever, the news this quarter is our amazing associates,” he said in a statement. “They are rising to the challenge to serve our customers and our communities.”



But worker advocacy groups say the company’s gains have come at the risk of employees’ health. At least 22 Walmart employees have died from covid-related complications since March, according to labor advocacy group United for Respect.

Walmart said it is providing free masks and gloves to employees and has installed sneeze guards at its checkouts. It has also announced two rounds of bonuses — $150 for part-time workers, $300 for full-timers — who work through the pandemic. It said it spent nearly $900 million on employee bonuses and other covid-related costs.



The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it is discontinuing the e-commerce site Jet.com “due to the continued strength of the Walmart brand.” Walmart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com in 2016 and continued to invest heavily in the site in hopes that it would help win over younger, more affluent, big-city shoppers from Amazon. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)



Home Depot, meanwhile, said sales at U.S. stores open at least one year rose nearly 8 percent. Profits fell nearly 12 percent to $2.25 billion, as the company spent more on wages and cleaning stores.

“Although the pandemic has shrouded the retail world in gloom, Home Depot’s results are something of a bright spot,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.



That was not the case at Kohl’s, which was one of thousands of retailers that shut its stores and furloughed the majority of its workers in March. The department store chain posted $541 million quarterly loss, compared with a $62 million profit in the same period last year.



“Kohl’s results show the extent of the damage the pandemic has caused to nonessential retailers,” Saunders said. Though he said a number of factors worked in the company’s favor, including its focus on fitness apparel and the location of its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls, “the toll on the financial health of Kohl’s should not be underestimated.”

“If a reasonably well positioned retailer like Kohl’s is posting such bad numbers, it does not bode at all well for much weaker players in the market,” he said.",real
256,1389,https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/2020/05/faucis-covid-19-pediatric-panic-porn-andrew-bostom/,2020-05-19,Fauci’s Covid-19 Pediatric Panic Porn,"A peculiar -- and troubling -- stand on the re-opening U.S. schools.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, eminence grise Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is America’s most prominent and vocal advocate of continued covid-19 “lockdown” policies. Inured to Dr. Fauci’s strident promotion of such draconian lockdowns, it was still jarring to hear his cynical, fearmongering suggestion, during a Senate hearing, Tuesday, May 12th. Fauci maintained that what students “really want to know” about their own safety, vis-à-vis covid-19, and school re-openings, is the availability of an effective vaccine—impossible by this fall.

…the idea of having…a vaccine available to facilitate the re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far. We’re not talking about necessarily treating a student who gets ill but how the student will feel safe in going back to school. If this were a situation where we had a vaccine that would really be the end of that issue in a positive way. But…even at the top speed we’re going we don’t see a vaccine playing in the ability of individuals to get back to school this term. What they really want is to know if they are safe…

Senator—and medical doctor (i.e., a Duke Medical Center trained practicing ophthalmologist)—Rand Paul’s cogent riposte to Dr. Fauci, in stark contrast, was a measured, evidence-based elucidation of reassuring facts about covid-19 among children, which the NIAID Director’s alarmist presentation disingenuously ignored.

…With regard to going back to school, one thing left out of that discussion is mortality. Shouldn’t we be discussing what the mortality of children [i.e., with covid-19] is? The mortality for zero to 18 approaches zero. It almost approaches zero. Between 18 and 45, the mortality in New York [City] was 10 out of 100,000 [now 18/100,000, i.e., 0.018%, for those 18-44]. So really we do need to be thinking about that. We need to think what happened in Sweden where the kids kept going to school. The mortality rate [in Sweden] is less than France. Less than Italy, Less than Spain. Less than Belgium. Less than The Netherlands. About the same as Switzerland. [Note: Actually less than the U.S. with simple age-adjustment given Sweden’s older population]. Basically, I don’t think there’s anybody arguing that what happened in Sweden is unacceptable…I think one size fits all is ridiculous. We ought to be doing it [re-opening] school district by school district and the power dispersed because people make wrong predictions. The history will be wrong prediction after wrong prediction starting with (disgraced hypocrite Neil) Ferguson in England…As much as I respect you (Dr. Fauci), I don’t think you’re the end all…If we keep kids out of school for another year what’s going to happen [is that] the poor and underprivileged kids are not going to learn for a full year. I think we should look at our kids getting back to school. I think it’s a huge mistake if we don’t open the schools in the fall.

Briefly, documentation from well-beyond New York City, just below, independently validates Rand Paul’s circumscribed claims.

--The Center For Disease Control and Prevention in its “COVIDView” 5/1/20 declared covid-19 hospitalization rates for children (0-17 years old) were “much lower than influenza hospitalization rates during recent influenza seasons.”

--A 5/11/20 JAMA report 46 from U.S. and Canadian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) confirmed the rarity of serious pediatric covid-19 disease noting: “most PICUs across North America reporting no children admitted with this disease during the study period”; despite the fact that “more than 80% [of the small number admitted] had significant long-term underlying medical conditions”…most commonly “long-term dependence on technological support associated with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies…overall survival and outcomes from critical illness in infants and children with COVID-19 was far better than reported for adult patients.” The authors concluded, “our data indicate that children are at far greater risk of critical illness from influenza than from COVID-19.”

--Stanford University Prevention Research Center’s Dr. John Ioannides, and colleagues, analyzed covid-19 mortality data as of April 4, 2020 from European countries and U.S. states, or major cities, with at least 250 [then] covid-19 deaths (total deaths included=25,692). An analysis pooling data from New York City, Italy, and the Netherlands, for example, revealed that only 0.9% of all deaths occurred in those < 65, without known underlying co-morbidities.

Moreover, Senator Paul’s limited time for discussion precluded mention of data repeatedly demonstrating--from Australia, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and France—that children, certainly those below 10-years old, are less likely to contract covid-19, and dramatically less prone to transmit the disease to others. Indeed, the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (4/11/20) described a covid-19 infected 9-year old child, contact traced as part of a cluster of cases in the French Alps, who did not transmit the virus to 112 contacts at schools, or a ski class. “However” as the report noted, “the high proportion of picornavirus and influenza infections among his contacts at the schools indicated transmission of those viruses within those settings.”

Although Dr. Fauci’s response to Sen. Paul closed with a grudging and passing concession to “the numbers” in children, his initial comments riveted upon what has been aptly characterized as pediatric panic porn(ography).

Right now children [are] presenting with covid-16 (sic), covid-19, who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome very similar to Kawasaki’s Syndrome [Disease]. I think we better be careful that we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects. So again, I think you’re right in the numbers that children, in general, do much, much better than adults and the elderly…That’s why I am very reserved in making broad predictions.

Thus, even after Sen. Paul resoundingly debunked Fauci’s opening presentation alarmism, the NIAID Director had the temerity to raise the specter of “Kawasaki Syndrome” in children with covid-19, completely de-contextualizing this uncommon, and generally transient inflammatory condition’s well-established association to all manner of respiratory infections each year--including otherwise rather benign human coronaviruses that cause 15-30% of common colds! For example, a 2016 study published in one of the pre-eminent childhood illness journals, Pediatrics, found that 42% of 192 children admitted with Kawasaki Syndrome had a detectable respiratory infection, 7/192, or 3.6%, testing positive for one of three cold-causing human coronaviruses. Finally, a refreshingly sober 5/9/20 perspective on the ginned up covid19-Kawasaki Disease hysteria Dr. Fauci was content to fan, based upon review of 100 purported “cases,” concluded the syndrome was “rare, “children seem to improve rapidly,” “and children are probably still spared from most morbidities and mortality linked to COVID-19 infection.”

Contra the prevailing hard left-dominated “mainstream” media caricature, President Trump weighed in (during a 5/14/20 interview with Maria Bartiromo) thoughtfully, if firmly, on the matter of school re-opening, and rejected Dr. Fauci’s opinion:

[~2:37-3:01] Young people are very little affected by this (covid-19). We have to get the schools open…I totally disagree with him (Fauci) on schools.

Acknowledging the lethal havoc covid-19 had wrought upon the vulnerable elderly, “the elderly have been decimated,” the President added this reasonable caveat:

[~14;35-15:05] Open the schools. But if a teacher is 65 or older, especially if they have diabetes, if they have a bad heart, if they have a (medical) problem, we say relax for a longer period of time. But if you look, there’s been very little damage done to people that are healthy and young, and frankly medium age people.

Poisoned with their own deranged hatred of POTUS Trump, which renders them impenetrable by fact, “mainstream” media sneered its collective disapproval of his remarks (examples here; here: here).

Notwithstanding Dr. Fauci’s factually-challenged covid-19 pediatric panic stoking, reflexively amplified by the media chorus of apocalyptic covid-19 brayers, school re-openings are burgeoning across Europe (including Denmark; France; The Netherlands; Switzerland; Greece; Croatia; Serbia; and Slovenia), Australia—and Montana, here in the U.S. Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Nick Coatsworth, published an eminently rational justification for the nation’s school re-opening policy on 5/3/20. Coatsworth observed,

When school closures were initially proposed to control an epidemic, planners had influenza in mind. Flu spreading within schools and children are the main source for transmission in the community. But COVID-19 is not the flu. Far fewer children are affected by COVID-19, and the number of transmissions from children to children and children to adults is far less… As an infectious diseases specialist, I have examined all of the available evidence from within Australia and around the world and, as it stands, it does not support avoiding classroom learning as a means to control COVID-19.

He concluded by contrasting these marginal to unknown “benefits” on covid-19 disease transmission, with the self-evident deleterious social effects of school closures:

Firstly, the disruption to routine and socialization, while temporary, tends to have a disproportionate effect on our more vulnerable children, including those with disability or particular learning needs. School is a critical element of good health across all age ranges. Secondly, it increases stress within the family environment, with parents having to juggle home schooling and work. Sixty-two percent of Australian families have two working parents. Parents extend their working day into the evening to compensate for the need to home school.

Would that Dr. Fauci was a public health official possessed of such sober wisdom. Americans, instead, must disregard Fauci’s covid-19 pediatric panic porn, and demand that U.S. schools be re-opened selectively, now, and full re-opened by late summer.",fake
260,624,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/well/live/coronavirus-cleaning-cleaners-disinfectants-home.html,2020-05-06,Have I Been Cleaning All Wrong?,"
Ever since the coronavirus became a threat, many of us are doing a lot more cleaning at home, spraying and wiping pretty much everything in sight, especially high-touch surfaces like door knobs and faucet handles.
But many of us are used to giving a surface a quick spray, followed by a wipe or two, which may not allow enough time for the product to work. And once you start reading labels on cleaning products closely, it gets really confusing. Several readers pointed out that disinfectant wipes and spray cleaners have different instructions on their labels for how long a cleaner should stay on a surface to effectively kill germs, ranging from 30 seconds to four minutes or even as long as 10 minutes. What’s more, some labels recommend cleaning before using a disinfectant.
So what’s the right way to clean? We talked to infectious disease scientists and microbiologists who study and test cleaning products to answer your questions about cleaning in the time of coronavirus. The bottom line: Whether you’re worried about coronavirus or other germs that lurk in our homes, many of us are cleaning too fast for the disinfectant to do its job.
Here’s what the experts said.How long does a disinfectant need to stay on a surface in order to kill germs?You probably need to let your disinfectant stay on the surface you’re cleaning for far longer than you think.
“The longer you can let it be in contact, the better,” said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children’s Hospital. “What I’ve been doing at home: I wait roughly a minute if I’m applying a spray product and then wiping.”
To find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. The guidance could range from 30 seconds to several minutes of contact time before you wipe. Note that some products may claim to sanitize, which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses. A disinfectant claim means the product destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and viruses noted on the label.
Even cleaners from the same brand have different contact times. My bottle of Clorox bleach says five minutes of contact time, while Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach advises 30 seconds. Clorox Anywhere Hard Surface says two minutes (but it promises to kill only bacteria, not viruses), while Clorox Disinfecting Wipes says four minutes. Even among similar Lysol branded wipes, the recommended contact time varies — the lavender scented wipe recommends 10 minutes of contact time, whereas the lemon-lime scented wipe says four minutes.
Why are the recommended contact times so different? It depends on which bacteria and viruses the product claims to kill. To make a disinfectant claim, a product has to go through a strict testing process set forth by a country’s regulatory agencies. In the United States, it’s the Environmental Protection Agency. To test a disinfectant, scientists cover a surface with a large dose of the organism being studied. They then douse the surface with a disinfectant and let it sit for a set amount of time before testing to determine whether any of the organisms remain viable.
Those tests are essentially worst-case scenarios using excessively high concentrations of germs — about 100,000 organisms per centimeter — which is far more than would typically be found in a home setting. “Most common surfaces in homes and hospitals have less than 100 organisms per square centimeter,” said Dr. David Weber, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
But even though the contact time advice is probably overkill, to be certain a surface has been completely disinfected, you should pay attention to the disinfection time recommendations on the label, especially when someone in the house has been sick. In some cases, organism contamination can reach very high levels in a home — like when you are working with raw chicken in a kitchen or when someone in the house is ill and an area has been contaminated with stool or vomit. And some organisms, like norovirus, which causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, are particularly tough to eliminate and can cause illness in infinitesimal doses.
Why does the label say a surface has to be cleaned before using a disinfectant? Do I really have to clean twice?If your surface is covered in crumbs, grime or spilled food, then yes, you do need to clean away the debris and dirt before using a disinfectant.
“For a germicide to work, it has to touch the germs,” said Dr. Weber, who has consulted for PDI, a firm that makes disinfectants. “If you have a layer of grime, the dirt can protect the bacteria. Cleaning has to precede disinfection.”
Some cleaners promise to both clean and disinfect, but even those labels advise pre-cleaning a heavily soiled surface.
The label on my disinfectant wipes says I should use them for four minutes. Do I really have to wipe that long?When wipes are tested in laboratory conditions, the clock starts with the first wipe and continues until the surface dries. So you don’t have to wipe for a full four minutes (or whatever time is advised on the label). The goal is for the wiping time and drying time to last four minutes, says Haley Oliver, a microbiologist and associate professor of food science at Purdue University.
In a recent study of disinfectant wipes, Dr. Oliver and colleagues tested a six-inch formica square covered with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The surface was wiped four times with a disinfectant wipe and left to dry. Five out of six products tested remained wet on the surface until the label contact time was reached. One product dried 15 seconds too soon, but it still worked well against germs.
“I think being conscious of contact time is important,” says Dr. Oliver, whose research includes work with Diversy, a major producer of cleaning and disinfectant products. “If this is my house and I’m on a wipe campaign, I want to see that the wipe deposited liquid on that surface.”
I often use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. Should I use a new wipe each time so I don’t spread germs?You can use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. As long as the wipe remains wet, an indication that it still has plenty of cleaner on it, you don’t have to worry about spreading organisms around. That said, most experts I spoke with prefer not to mix rooms. So they would use one wipe on multiple surfaces in a bathroom, for example, but they wouldn’t use that same wipe in the kitchen.
Dr. Oliver notes that there isn’t official guidance on how much surface area one wipe can cover. The key to disinfecting with wipes is to be aware when your wipe is running out of disinfectant. “If it’s not wet, then you’re not contacting microbes with the chemistry that was intended,” says Dr. Oliver. “If you’ve run out of the ingredient and your towelette is dry, you could be transmitting those organisms around.”
What’s the best cleaner to get rid of coronavirus?Product labels will say specifically what types of bacteria and viruses have been tested. But because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is so new, most cleaning products haven’t been tested against it. The E.P.A. has, however, published a list of products expected to kill the virus because they are proven against harder-to-kill viruses or other types of coronavirus.
The good news is that the new coronavirus is actually much easier to kill than many of the organisms previously studied. So it is likely that even if you haven’t been following the contact time recommendations for disinfectants, you have probably been killing the virus. But you need to follow label direction to tackle harder-to-kill germs like E. coli, salmonella or staph.
“It’s important to note that these recommendations are generic and typically based on how long it takes to kill bacteria — for example, Staph and Strep, which are much harder to kill than a virus like SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. “Shorter times of exposure are most likely still quite effective to prevent Covid-19.”

So why did the president just cancel Daszak's funding? It's the kind of politics which might seem ill-advised in a health crisis. President Trump is blaming China's government for the pandemic. The outbreak was first detected in the city of Wuhan. The administration has said, at times, the virus is man-made or that, if it's natural, it must have leaked out of a Chinese government lab. Both the White House and the Chinese Communist Party have been less than honest. And so, in China, and the U.S., the work of scientists like Peter Daszak is being undercut by pandemic politics.

Peter Daszak is a British-born American Ph.D. who's spent a career discovering dangerous viruses in wildlife, especially bats.

In 2003, in Malaysia, he warned 60 Minutes a pandemic was coming.

Peter Daszak in 2003 interview: What worries me the most is that we are going to miss the next emerging disease, that we're suddenly going to find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.

Peter Daszak

In the 17 years since that prophecy, Peter Daszak became president of the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.

Peter Daszak: We're a nonprofit research organization that focuses on understanding where the pandemics come from, what's the risk of future pandemics and can we get in between this pandemic and the next one and disrupt it and stop it.

In China, EcoHealth has worked for 15 years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Together they've catalogued hundreds of bat viruses, research that is critical right now.

Peter Daszak: The breakthrough drug, Remdesivir, that seems to have some impact on COVID-19 was actually tested against the viruses we discovered under our NIH research funding.

Scott Pelley: And so that testing would not have been possible--

Peter Daszak: No, it would not.

Scott Pelley: --if it hadn't been for the work that you did with the NIH grant?

Peter Daszak: Correct.

But his funding from the NIH, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was killed, two weeks ago, by a political disinformation campaign targeting China's Wuhan Institute.

On April 14, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz claimed China's Wuhan Institute had, quote, ""birthed a monster."" Gaetz is a vigorous defender of the president. He's been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegedly threatening a witness against Mr. Trump and he led a protest to delay impeachment testimony.

U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, speaks during a rally hosted by FreedomWorks on Sept. 26, 2018, at the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Getty

Matt Gaetz on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"": The NIH gives this $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they then advertise that they need coronavirus researchers. Following that, coronavirus erupts in Wuhan.

There never was a $3.7 million U.S. grant to the Wuhan lab. But, the falsehood spread like a virus, in the White House, and without verification, in the briefing room.

Reporter in White House press briefing: There's also another report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?

President Trump: The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I've been hearing about that. And we've instructed that if any grants are going to that area – we're looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly.

That grant was to Peter Daszak's U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance for disease prevention it does throughout the world. His work was considered so important that, last year, the grant was reauthorized and increased by the Trump administration.

Why it matters that the NIH canceled a coronavirus research grant

Daszak had been spending about $100,000 a year collaborating with the Wuhan lab.

Peter Daszak: I can't just show up in China and say, ""Hi, I wanna work on your viruses."" I have to do this through the correct channels. So, what we do is we talk to NIH, and they approve the people we can work with in China. And that happened. And our collaboration with Wuhan was preapproved by NIH.

Scott Pelley: What is the theory of the work that you've done with the Wuhan lab?

Peter Daszak: Well, the idea is that we know that viruses that affect people and pandemics tend to come from wildlife. So, our strategy is to go to the wildlife source, find out where the viruses are, and try and shift behaviors like hunting and killing wildlife that would lead to the next outbreak. We also get the information into vaccine and drug developers so they can design better drugs.

The Wuhan Institute is internationally respected. Two years ago, a team from the U.S. Embassy visited. That team sent a cable to Washington, concerned that one lab in the complex had a serious shortage of trained investigators. But the cable, first reported by the Washington Post, emphasized the Wuhan Institute is ""critical to future… outbreak prediction and prevention."" EcoHealth's work with Wuhan ended one week after Mr. Trump's briefing room pledge, when the NIH revoked the grant.

Scott Pelley: They gave you no reason?

Peter Daszak: They said it was canceled for convenience and it doesn't fit within the scope of NIH's priorities right now.

Scott Pelley: And yet it was a high priority when the grant was reissued in 2019?

Peter Daszak: Yeah it's definitely puzzling. I mean, this grant received an incredibly high-priority score. It was in the top 3% of grants they reviewed. And that's unusual.

Maureen Miller

Maureen Miller: I was shocked. I was really, really surprised.

Maureen Miller is a Ph.D. epidemiologist at Columbia University who has collaborated with EcoHealth and Wuhan.

Maureen Miller: It stops the research that's essential to understanding where pandemics like the one we're going through, where they start.

Scott Pelley: How often are NIH grants terminated in this way?

Maureen Miller: This is the first one I've ever heard of. When they terminate an NIH grant, and it's not something that's usually taken lightly, it is for cause. There's fraud involved at some level. There is either manipulation of the data, you're putting your participants in harm's way, or your data are fraudulent.

Scott Pelley: And none of those things have been alleged with EcoHealth?

Maureen Miller: Absolutely not. None.

The National Institutes of Health, in its mission statement, says it exemplifies ""the highest level of scientific integrity and public accountability."" But it wouldn't tell us why the grant was cancelled or whether anything like it had happened before. The NIH told us to direct questions about the origin of the virus to the director of national intelligence.

The Chinese Communist Party has also blocked the truth. In the earliest days, the doctor in Wuhan who discovered the outbreak was silenced by local officials. He later died of COVID-19. In February, the Chinese did allow a visit by an international team of experts including American scientists.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a news briefing at the White House on the coronavirus outbreak, March 20, 2020, in Washington, DC. Getty

President Trump at State of the Union on 2/4/20: We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Initially, President Trump praised China. But in the following weeks, testing in the U.S. failed to catch up to the need, vital equipment was short, bodies filled refrigerated trailers, and science was continuously challenged.

President Trump at 4/23/20 briefing: Then I see disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection?

As the U.S. led the world in illness and death, the White House moved the focus to the Chinese government.

Last Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pomepo attempted to resurrect a debunked theory that the virus was man-made in China.

Mike Pompeo on ABC's ""This Week"": Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.

He did have reason. Days before, the director of national intelligence said there was ""wide scientific consensus"" the virus was not man-made.

Martha Raddatz on ABC's ""This Week"": Your Office of the DNI says the consensus, the scientific consensus was not man-made or genetically modified.

Mike Pompeo on ABC's ""This Week"": That's right. I agree with that.

The same day Pompeo tried to have it both ways, President Trump repeated the theory of a Chinese lab accident.

President Trump at Fox News town hall: I think they made a horrible mistake and they didn't want to admit it.

Elodie Ghedin

The administration has offered no evidence of an accident or genetic engineering. Dr. Elodie Ghedin is studying the genome of the virus in her lab at New York University.

Elodie Ghedin: People have been saying that's an engineered virus. And it's not. And we know that by looking at the genetic information, looking at the code. And the code tells you a lot.

Human-engineered viruses have common and obvious genetic components, including the virus's overall molecular structure called its backbone.

Elodie Ghedin: If a virus had been engineered, it would've used the backbones that we know. And there's none of that in that virus. And let's say it was a brand-new backbone. Well, it wouldn't look like what it's looking like, because we can find every piece of that virus. We can find these pieces in other very similar viruses that circulate in the wild. From the genetic information, it's clearly not an engineered virus.

Elodie Ghedin and most experts believe the virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, passed from a wild animal into humans, perhaps in the wild animal market in Wuhan. Many early cases were traced to this market and a market like it was where the SARS virus jumped into a human in 2003.

Elodie Ghedin: A lot of these coronaviruses are found in bats. But we haven't found the exact match. We did find a close match in pangolins. It's an anteater. It's a wildlife that's been traded. People, you know, will consume its meat. But they also use in Chinese medicine, its scales.

Scott Pelley: Is there a way to know that this virus, SARS-CoV-2 emerged from the wild into the human population? Or has that not been proven yet?

Peter Daszak: Well, I'm a scientist. And what I do is I look at the evidence around a hypothesis. There is a huge amount of evidence that these viruses repeatedly emerge into people from wild animals in rural areas through things like hunting and eating wildlife. There is zero evidence that this virus came out of a lab in China.

Scott Pelley: Does the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to your knowledge, have this virus in its inventory?

Peter Daszak: No.

Scott Pelley: Why do you say so?

Peter Daszak: The closest known relative is one that's different enough that it is not SARS-CoV-2. So, there's just no evidence that anybody had it in the lab anywhere in the world prior to the outbreak.

Matt Gaetz on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"": I have called on Secretary Azar to immediately halt this grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They have not been honest and at worst, negligent to the point of many, many deaths throughout the world.

Matt Gaetz wears a gas mask on the floor of the House in early March

Dishonest and negligent allegations have now ended EcoHealth's carefully reviewed research designed to stop pandemics. Representative Matt Gaetz wore a gas mask on the floor of the House to lampoon the crisis. This was back in the beginning of March, weeks before masks were common. Peter Daszak, whose researchers wear masks to shield them from viruses in the wild, says his team is now facing layoffs.

Peter Daszak: This politicization of science is really damaging. You know, the conspiracy theories out there have essentially closed down communication between scientists in China and scientists in the U.S. We need that communication in an outbreak to learn from them how they control it so we can control it better. It's sad to say, but it will probably cost lives. By sort of narrow-mindedly focusing in on ourselves, or on labs, or on certain cultural politics, we miss the real enemy.

Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has contracted coronavirus infection. The head of the Russian government has temporarily resigned.

Mishustin, who was diagnosed with Covid-19, suggested appointing first Vice Prime Minister Andrey Belousov acting head of the Russian government. President Putin supported the initiative and promised to sign the adequate decree today, April 30.

Mikhail Mishustin will spend the next two weeks in self-isolation.

""I have just discovered that I was tested positive for coronavirus. In this connection, as well as in accordance with requirements of Rospotrebnadzor, I must observe self-isolation regime. This is absolutely necessary in order to protect my colleagues,"" said Mishustin, addressing Putin via video conference.

The Prime Minister assured that the government would continue working as usual.

""What is happening to you now can happen to anyone,"" Putin said, thanking Mishustina for his work. The president also promised that he would continue to consult Mishustin in making decisions on issues that they had previously discussed.

In turn, Mishustin appealed to Russian citizens with a request to act as responsibly as possible during the May holidays.

The sailors who ""previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,"" a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson said in a statement. The sailors are now off the ship and are required to isolate for at least 14 days.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Experts said the perplexing test results don't necessarily establish that a person can become infected twice — the positive results following negative tests may be a quirk related to the type of test that was used.

Nearly all of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the U.S. look for snippets of the virus' RNA, or genetic code. (Another type of diagnostic test, called an antigen test, looks for proteins from the virus.)

But according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present."" In other words, the test may be picking up a piece of the viral RNA that's been left behind, rather than a fully intact, infectious virus particle.

A second positive test after a negative result may mean the virus is simply taking its time leaving the body, doctors said, and is no longer able to infect others.

""It's possible that people could shed remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with them or that they are contagious,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

A study from South Korea bolsters that idea. Researchers at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data on 285 COVID-19 patients who also tested positive after having appeared to recover.

Scientists were unable to find evidence that the patients remained infectious. And viral samples taken from the patients couldn't be prompted to grow and thrive in lab studies, suggesting that the samples were duds.

""What we're finding more and more is that the fragments of virus that are being picked up on these swabs weeks later are not able to replicate,"" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. ""They're not live virus.""

Still, the world has known about COVID-19 only for mere months, giving scientists no indication yet of how the virus acts long term.

""We just don't have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology,"" said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Sanders said the different diagnostic results might also be explained by false negatives. ""I think that there is a lot to be learned about the testing and about the protective impact of having been infected or having developed an antibody,"" he said.

Sanders and a team of researchers at Wake Forest have embarked on an ambitious study to get a feel for how the virus acts in people, how long symptoms last and how COVID-19 might lead to immunity from secondary infections, at least for a certain period of time.

The group has enrolled 15,000 volunteers, some of whom have had COVID-19 and others who haven't. Each day, the volunteers are asked to record any possible symptoms they're experiencing. If a person reports any kind of symptom, such as fever or a cough, researchers ask for more information.

""We will send them a home test collection kit to send back to us. We'll test them to see if they have the virus and then continue to track them for antibodies after that,"" Sanders said.

The research team will upload the results into a database, tracking symptoms in real time. Ideally, public health officials could then compare the information with electronic health records. Sanders said the project aims to tease out whether an uptick in cough, for example, correlates with a true rise in COVID-19 or simply with allergy season.

The research group plans to conduct antibody testing on 10,000 of the volunteers six times over the next year. So far, all of the volunteers are from health systems in North Carolina, but researchers are working to expand the study along the East Coast.

""We have dozens of unanswered research questions about whether or not an antibody protects you against future infection, about whether or not you get complications after a COVID infection,"" Sanders said.

""This also allows us to collect the information necessary to start answering those more detailed questions.""

Opinion contributor

One month ago, as COVID-19 spread across the county and critical personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, surgical gowns and face shields continued to be in short supply, I had hoped the government would do its job and act to meet this demand. But when news outlets reported that medical workers were being left vulnerable to infection without PPE, it was clear we couldn't wait for the Trump administration any longer.

A small group of volunteers came together to found Masks for America and teamed up with leading health care activist Ady Barkan's Be A Hero Fund, Social Security Works and National Nurses United to get our front-line heroes the equipment they needed to stay safe as they saved lives.

As the federal government failed to provide essential equipment, our small group of volunteers has successfully delivered nearly 200,000 FDA-certified, CDC-approved KN95 masks to front-line workers in hard hit areas — New York City, Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico — in just a matter of weeks. But it wasn’t easy, because when the federal government finally decided to act, it wasn’t the way we had expected. Instead of helping us, they seized some of our PPE shipments without telling us where they were taking them.

Unprecedented federal interference

On April 11, during the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City, the Federal Emergency Management Agency intervened and demanded orders of medical equipment allocated to our relief efforts be redirected to the federal government. FEMA then seized 50,000 N95 respirators we had ordered without giving us an explanation or telling us where those respirators were going.

In my 15 years of working in the manufacturing industry with international and domestic supply chains, I have never — never — had the federal government interfere like this.

It wasn’t long before I realized it wasn’t only happening in New York and New Jersey. FEMA confiscated San Francisco’s PPE order as it went through customs, even as the Trump administration told states and cities to procure their own equipment rather than rely on the federal government. Since those reports of FEMA quietly seizing materials, at least six states have lodged similar complaints against the federal government interfering with their supply chains.

Over 100 health leaders to governors:Require masks to help contain COVID-19

It is not illegal for the government to seize and distribute medical shipments through the Defense Production Act, yet our government has failed to be transparent with the public about how and why it is redistributing the resources of cities, states and private organizations like ours.

The struggle to secure PPE and medical supplies isn’t just a failure of leadership in our government but also an unsustainable supply chain issue that has been bubbling just under the surface for years.

Bring manufacturing back to America

Over the past two decades, I’ve fought as our nation offshored millions of American manufacturing jobs overseas. Most PPE and other medical equipment is now made in China, which has led to increased difficulty for the government to produce and distribute crucial resources during a disaster. This, in addition to FEMA’s track record of inefficiency and failure to provide adequate disaster relief, has led to the government’s shortage and is likely why officials are taking equipment from a small volunteer-driven coalition that was able to leverage its resources and know-how to do the job they couldn’t do.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

International production lines are taking weeks to deliver the resources we need to keep people alive. If we were manufacturing PPE and medical supplies in the United States, it would take mere days to deliver protection to front-line essential workers where it’s needed. Reshoring the production of PPE and other essential public health resources permanently could also bring millions of good manufacturing jobs home, at a time when more than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

As we approach 1.5 million confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 and 89,000 deaths, with thousands more projected daily, it’s clearer than ever that we as a nation will need to hold our government accountable for the series of systemic failures that led us to the point of FEMA seizing PPE from nurses, state governments and nonprofit relief efforts without explanation or transparency.

Epidemiologist Q&A:‘We're just in the second inning of a nine-inning game’

While there is much to learn from this ongoing pandemic, one thing is clear — for our nation's public health and national security, Congress must take immediate action to reshore PPE and medical supply production lines back into the United States. Otherwise, we’ll continue to be vulnerable, doomed to repeat the deadly missteps of this pandemic.

It isn’t even the greatest public health crisis in our history. But with the imposition of a near total national lockdown it is undoubtedly the greatest marginalization of personal liberty in American history.

Over the centuries, in virtually all societies, people known to be infected by various deadly diseases were confined and isolated in order to mitigate the spread and protect the rest of society. Never have we confined the entire population ostensibly for the same objective.

Over the past 50 years, an ever-increasing percentage of the citizenry has been conditioned to look to the government to cure all societal and health related ills. The ruling classes have eagerly promoted this mindset as it abets their lust for permanent power. However, this obligates those in power to cure all ills, even a global pandemic. Thus, it follows that the State will inevitably claim that in order to do so it must take control of our lives against our will even if we are healthy, lest we fall ill and overwhelm the health care system.

Using exponentially flawed models and projections, not based on any actual evidence or experience with the virus, the government at all levels so terrified the populace that they eagerly embraced the concept of home confinement and the catastrophic collapse of the economy. But one question that the powers-to-be never asked themselves at the time was: How do we get out of this? Now they find themselves trapped by their own decisions.

Recently, both the federal government and states have proposed various goals that must be met before the lockdown is fully lifted. What is egregiously wrong with all these steps is that they are solely about health and arbitrary health related statistics.

Rather than look at the devastated economy as well as the unbelievable and potential life-threatening distress of the vast bulk of the American people, these politicians are hiding behind government scientist/bureaucrats, believing that focus on just Wuhan Virus statistics will shield them from criticism. The national leadership of the Democrat party are also hiding behind the scientists to not only avoid criticism but to prolong the lockdown in the hope that the economy and nation is still in shambles on November 3, election day.

The reality is the decision to reopen the nation is a political decision, not a scientific one.

It all boils down to one simple question. Has the lockdown been worth it? That depends only partly on science. There are also three other factors that must go into that answer: 1) economic consequences, 2) constitutional values and 3) moral judgements.

First, the medical aspect. The declared purpose of the lockdown was to mitigate what was projected to be a complete meltdown of available intensive care and hospital beds nationwide or in now common parlance “bend the curve.” At the height of the virus outbreak, the nation utilized less than 15% of available hospital beds and less than 20% of available intensive care beds for coronavirus patients. This curve has been bent for some time.

Deaths from nursing and senior care facilities homes now account for more than 50% of total recorded fatalities since the beginning of the epidemic. In some states it is as high as 80%. Over the past three weeks nursing home related deaths account for nearly 70% of reported fatalities. As Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review recently wrote:

This revelation should change everything we know about the current state of affairs with coronavirus. Governors are still justifying the continued lockdown by pointing to rising deaths in many states and counties. But it now appears, using simple arithmetic, that in most states, the overwhelming majority of deaths are in nursing homes, and in some states and counties, nearly every new death is in a senior facility. The implication is that there is no excuse whatsoever not to open up the country and throw all our resources at protecting nursing homes.

Numerous serology study results have been extrapolated to show when accounting for the true number of people who have gotten this virus, the infection fatality rate drops to 0.1% to 0.3% (about the same as the annual flu). A recent study at Truesdale Prison in Tennessee recorded that of 2,444 tests 1,299 were positive (53%) and 96% of those were asymptomatic (showing no symptoms). One inmate (67 years old) has died or a fatality rate of 0.07%.

Accounting for the fact that the deaths are lopsided among the elderly and chronically ill, the fatality rate among the younger population approaches 0.03%.

This virus will never disappear unless and until there is enough exposure to produce a collective immunity or an effective vaccine, available to everyone in the world, is produced. There is no scientific basis, centered on actual findings either in the United States or around the world, for continuing for weeks or months any full or partial shutdown of the general population on either the national, state or local level.

Second, the economic consequences. There has been the inevitable leftist decrying of any attempt to measure the mortality of the coronavirus against the economic and emotional cost of the chosen means of mitigating it. But this is nothing but empty rhetoric as well as hypocritical. All of us whether a tenured college professor and a grocery store clerk and a government bureaucrat and an over-the-road truck driver value and depend upon the economy to generate wealth.

Hundreds of thousands of businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy and permanent closure. 33+ million are unemployed, many are forced against their will to be dependent on government largess and the federal government is creating massive unsustainable debt in an attempt to keep the nation afloat. A thriving economy, the kind we are now destroying, is the source of our security, the financing of our health care system and our children’s future. Without it this nation as we know it will cease to exist. While our leftist brothers may sneer at this reality, it should also be remembered that poverty kills as well. And when it does not kill, it maims, mentally, physically and socially.

Third, the erosion of constitutional values. What are the limits to the things that the State can legitimately do to a people living in a constitutional republic originally established on the basis of guaranteeing individual freedom?

Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Judge in the United Kingdom, recently wrote:

To say that there are no limits is the stuff of tyrants. Every despot who ever lived thought that he was coercing his subjects for their own good or that of society. We have to ask ourselves what kind of relationship we want with the State. Do we really want to be the kind of society where basic freedoms are conditional on the decisions of politicians in thrall to scientists and statisticians? Where human beings are just tools of public policy? A society in which Government can confine most of the population without controversy is not one in which civilized people would want to live, regardless of their [politicians] answer to” Is it worth it? My own answer is no. Guidance is fine. Voluntary self-isolation is fine, and strongly advisable for the more vulnerable. Most of them will do it by choice. But coercion is not fine. There is no moral or principled justification for it.

Lastly, on moral judgement. However valuable saving every life may be, it is not the only valuable thing to a society. A comparison is unavoidable between the lives that may be saved and the others lost in a massive national shutdown. Which includes those unable to access other lifesaving medical procedures, as many states effectively shut down hospitals and medical practices in order to theoretically mitigate the coronavirus epidemic.

Thus, it is empty rhetoric to regurgitate the talking point that every life is priceless whenever the subject of reopening the country is raised. These catch phrases are emotionally satisfying, but those that mouth them do not actually believe them, as many who fall back on these platitudes also promote and applaud abortion up to and at birth.

Societies and people make life altering choices all the time, be it going to war to protect the country, commuting two hours a day to work on crowded highways, travel by air, or working in a coal mine. These decisions are made as mankind is fully aware that there is more to life than the avoidance of death.

The answer to the question, “Was the lockdown worth it?” is a resounding no.

Ordering the citizenry to cower in their homes, harassing people for walking on an empty beach, and mandating small businesses close up shop regardless of their hygienic procedures has never, in the history of mankind, been demonstrated to be effective in combating any infectious disease. In summary, lockdowns do not work.

It was common knowledge by early March, based on the experience in Italy, South Korea and other nations, that this virus was problematic for the elderly with serious underlying conditions. (In Italy 85% of deaths have been among those over 70 with serious underlying conditions) Rather than focus and expend all available resources on that portion of the population, this nation decided, based on bogus science, to institute a state optioned complete or partial lockdown leaving that segment of society to essentially fend for itself -- with disastrous consequences. All the while decimating the economy, people’s livelihoods and marginalizing freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.

This nation has made the biggest blunder in its history.

The time has come for the politicians from the President to the Governors and Mayors to stop hiding behind the scientist/bureaucrats and fully reopen the nation. Focus on that segment of the population most at risk, without compulsory isolation or de facto imprisonment. And restore the civil liberties that have been wantonly eroded.

by CNN Philippines Staff

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

Our patent system is working, yet some want to change it in a way that will weaken the system of making sure all patents are valid.

With the prospect of faulty foreign drugs and tests being marketed to Americans for the coronavirus, now is a good time to protect against attempts to hurt American companies actually producing real products to test and fight COVID-19.

Techdirt reported on March 16, 2020, one such U.S. company was sued by Labrador Diagnostics “which does not seem to exist other than to file this lawsuit, and which claims to hold the rights to two patents (U.S. Patents 8,283,155 and 10,533,994) which, you'll note, were originally granted to Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos -- the firm that shut down in scandal over medical testing equipment that appears to have been oversold and never actually worked.” According to the report, Theranos sold patents to Fortress Investment, and Fortress “then set up this shell company, ‘Labrador Diagnostics,’ which decided in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic it was going to sue one of the companies making COVID-19 tests, saying their test violates those Theranos patents, and literally demanding that the court bar the firm from making those Covid-19 tests.”

Thankfully, instead of needing to spend millions of dollars and years in federal court, especially if there are appeals by one side or the other, Congress created a process to streamline such disputes in rare, but important cases.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has a proceeding called the Inter Partes Review (IPR) that was created in 2011 as part of the America Invents Act. That proceeding allows patents to be reviewed to see if they should not have ever been granted. A patent might not have been eligible to have been granted in the first place if so-called “prior art” existed to show the item or process the patent covers already exists or is already patented. Duplicate patents are sometimes missed by overworked patent examiners during the review process. Also, there are situations where the patented item is not “new, novel or non-obvious,” which is the required standard for a patent. The IPR is a proceeding that reviews whether the patent should have ever been granted and is conducted by an administrative body of expert patent examiners called the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).

Some in Congress are seeking to change the IPR system in a way that will empower trial lawyers and return to a time when shell companies like Labrador, which produce no goods or services, sued thousands of productive, job creating American business every year. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) has legislation to weaken the patent system misnamed the “STRONGER Patents Act” that would eliminate the strongest tool American employers have to strike down the type of bad patents used in these sort of frivolous lawsuits. The Coons bill exhibits a misunderstanding of the purpose of patent law. If enacted it would allow bogus patents to empower shell companies from all over the world created solely for patent litigation to file endless lawsuits for the purposes of extorting large amounts of money from U.S. companies large and small.

A number of the most respected economics, business and legal scholars who make it their business to study intellectual property law have come to the conclusion in a letter to Congress that the Inter Partes Review is a critical cog in patent law and that the Coons’ bill is the wrong approach. The experts argue, “for years, the Patent Office has operated under tremendous workload pressure. In 2018, the Patent Office received over 640,000 patent applications and allowed over 360,000 patents. Patent examiners on average have only nineteen hours to examine patent applications.” Mistakes happen and some invalid patents are issued. The IPR is a backstop for overworked patent examiners.

Without IPR, many U.S. businesses would be forced to pay off these shell companies even if they knew the case against them was bogus. The experts made the case that “even for the lowest-stakes category of patent lawsuits (in which less than $1 million is at risk), median litigation costs are $500,000. And for the highest-stakes lawsuits (in which more than $25 million is at risk), median litigation costs rise to over $3 million.” Frequently, the targets of NPEs make a business decision and settle (pay) rather than litigate, because the “cost of winning” still leads to less resources for things like more staff, research and development and other forms of business growth. Because the IPR is faster and less expensive than a trial in federal court, it gives these businesses a way to fight back without breaking the bank.

The IPR has removed hundreds of invalidly issued patents and changing existing law would harm patent quality, hurt American employers, and slow our post-COVID recovery. It is ironic that the “STRONGER Patents Act” pushed by Sen. Coons would weaken the whole process and empower NPEs to expand their efforts to target U.S. companies.

It is especially unnerving that unethical NPEs would engage in litigation that might slow help in fighting the coronavirus.

Andrea Circle Bear was 30 years old and had only recently given birth when she died of COVID-19. Circle Bear was incarcerated for a drug-related charge at the time of her death. She spent the final weeks of her pregnancy in a local jail and then a federal prison, spaces that are known hotbeds for virus transmission — and it’s likely in one of these places that she contracted the virus. She shared the planet with her baby for only 28 days before she passed.

While much attention has rightly been given to the risks of COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and detention centers, the risks to pregnant and postpartum women like Circle Bear have largely been overlooked.

Pregnancy alone does not appear to be a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19, but the data is clear that incarceration compounds the dangers associated with pregnancy. They are much more likely to get infected in prison or jail than in the community.

COLUMN:Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching

People who are incarcerated also have higher rates of underlying medical conditions —as Circle Bear did — that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Some suggest that people in prisons or jails who have symptoms of COVID-19, including those who are pregnant, be placed in solitary confinement as a form of quarantine. But solitary confinement can be especially damaging to prison or jail populations that are pregnant or have recently given birth because it can limit access to timely, adequate medical care.

During this time of rampant coronavirus spread and attempts at social distancing to avoid infection, it's imperative that pregnant populations are prioritized for release and diversion from prisons, jails and detention centers.

The situation is dire.

A new study estimates that at least 72% of people held in immigration detention centers are likely to get infected within the next 90 days. And the danger in jails and prisons is equally serious: Prisons that have conducted universal testing have found that an overwhelming number of the people they incarcerated are positive for COVID-19. One model estimates that 100,000 more people could die from COVID-19 than current estimates indicate if jail populations are not immediately and dramatically reduced.

COLUMN:Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act

A recent study that I conducted as a doctor and Johns Hopkins OBGYN researcher estimated that from 2016 to 2017, there were nearly 3,000 admissions of pregnant women to U.S. prisons and 55,000 to jails. Thousands are at risk for contracting COVID in custody and exposing their babies to danger.

As a physician and an attorney who work with populations that are pregnant and incarcerated, we have seen dangerous variability in their care. There is a dearth of protections for them, leaving many vulnerable to inadequate medical care and abuse: loss of reproductive choices, shackling during childbirth and solitary confinement, as well as the inevitable separation from their newborns.

The COVID-19 pandemic is terrifying for anyone who is pregnant. Those who are incarcerated are wrestling with the added COVID risks of their environment, such as close quarters, lack of adequate cleaning and limited protective equipment. These fears only exacerbate the existing dangers and stressors of being pregnant while incarcerated. Pregnancy, incarceration and COVID are a recipe for both increased medical risks and psychological trauma.

COLUMN:I'm a nurse battling against COVID-19, but DACA fight could end in my deportation

Having coronavirus also may mean being separated from newborns at the hospital. This would be a difficult experience for any new parent, but it is particularly devastating and harmful for those who are incarcerated because they are quickly sent back to the prison or jail, unable to see or hold their infants. And since prisons and jails have suspended visitations as a COVID prevention measure, the few opportunities new parents might have had for contact visits are gone. These traumatic separations interfere with their ability to bond with their children and cause severe emotional harm — for both the parent and the child.

Advocates and officials have made tremendous and rapid strides in depopulating prisons and jails, often focusing on releasing those who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19. We have seen success in some places. In North Carolina, more than a dozen pregnant women were moved out of prison last month. But more efforts are needed.

The situation for pregnant populations in our nation’s jails, prisons and detention centers has long been serious. But with COVID-19, it is now an emergency.

Circle Bear’s child should never have been left motherless, and she should not have had to face the dangers of incarceration, where she contracted COVID-19.

We must and we can prevent such senseless suffering.

296,44,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/are-covd-19-deaths-associated-hypertension-whats-risk-ace-rx/,2020-03-09,Mutation Which Makes Coronavirus Extremely Infectious,"While most of the mainstream is insisting that COVID-19 is not man made, rather a naturally occurring mutation, recent research from Europe and China has revealed that this disease happens to have an HIV like mutation which allows it to bind with human cells up to 1,000 times stronger than the SARS virus, according to SCMP.

In January 2020 a team of scientists wrote a paper that has since been retracted claiming that this coronavirus may have been genetically engineered to contain parts of the HIV genome, in the report they wrote: ""This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" in other words they are suggesting that it is unlikely to have occurred naturally.

Fast forward to more recently new research from Nankai University in which the team writes that this COV-19 has an HIV like mutation that allows it to rapidly enter the human body with an ACE2 receptor on a cell membrane:

“Other highly contagious viruses, including HIV and Ebola, target an enzyme called furin, which works as a protein activator in the human body. Many proteins are inactive or dormant when they are produced and have to be “cut” at specific points to activate their various functions.

When looking at the genome sequence of the new coronavirus, Professor Ruan Jishou and his team at Nankai University in Tianjin found a section of mutated genes that did not exist in Sars, but were similar to those found in HIV and Ebola,” writes -SCMP.

""This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV [the new coronavirus] may be significantly different from the Sars coronavirus in the infection pathway,"" reads the paper published this month on Chinaxiv.org - a platform used by the Chinese Academy of Sciences which releases research papers prior to peer-review. ""This virus may use the packing mechanisms of other viruses such as HIV,"" they added.

To help with the confusion this latest report claims that this coronavirus may contain a specific HIV like feature that makes it abundantly infectious which may be the result of a “bizarre mutation.” Since this report is not claiming that it was created to be an airborne version of HIV, rather a unexpected mutation they will most likely not have to retract it, even if the odds of such a bizarre and “random” mutation taking place naturally are extremely low.

According to the new report the mutation can generate a structure known as a cleavage site in the COVID-19’s spike protein, as compared to the SARS way of entry this binding method is 100 to 1000 times as efficient, according to the research team.

“The virus uses the outreaching spike protein to hook on to the host cell, but normally this protein is inactive. The cleavage site structure’s job is to cheat the human furin protein, so it will cut and activate the spike protein and cause a “direct fusion” of the viral and cellular membranes.” -SCMP

According to another paper published by Dr. Zhou Peng of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is a follow up of a study from Huazhong University of Science and Technology:

“The mutation could not be found in Sars, Mers or Bat-CoVRaTG13, a bat coronavirus that was considered the original source of the new coronavirus with 96 percent similarity in genes” it said. This could be “the reason why SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than other coronaviruses”, Li wrote in a paper released on Chinarxiv on Sunday.

French scientist Etienne Decroly at Aix-Marseille University, has published a study in the scientific journal Antiviral Research finding a “furin-like cleavage site” that is absent in similar coronaviruses.

Drugs targeting the furin enzyme are speculated to potentially hinder the virus replication inside of the host human body, and drugs for consideration include “a series of HIV-1 therapeutic drugs such as Indinavir, Tenofovir Alafenamide, Tenofovir Disoproxil and Dolutegravir and hepatitis C therapeutic drugs including Boceprevir and Telaprevir,"" according to Li's study.

This conclusion is inline with those of several reports from doctors who have self administered HIV drugs after they had tested positive for COVID-19, however it is worth noting that there have been no clinical tests conducted to either confirm or reject their theory.

The Chinese CDC at first didn’t consider this as a major threat, saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission, but this was invalidated quickly. There are suggestions that the link to furin may shed light on the evolution of the virus history that facilitated the jump to humans, as the “unexpected insertion” could come from coronavirus in rats or a species of avian flu, but more research is required to determine the cause of the bizarre mutation, all happening perfectly naturally, of course.

One important factoid not to overlook is that the ACE2 protein typically doesn’t exist in large quantities in healthy people.

So another question that comes to light from this is what is the risk for those who are taking ACE receptor inhibiting drugs such as those with hypertension? Are ACE drugs predisposing people with hypertension to the coronavirus? The American Heart Association estimates that there are 103 million American adults with high blood pressure alone and ACE inhibitors are the fourth most utilized drug class in America. Additionally, the older population is more prone to hypertension, and more likely to be taking ACE Rx. That could be a lot of people at an increased risk.",fake

In accordance with the decree signed by Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, as well as the decision made by Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov, cemeteries will be open only for the burial of the dead until the end of the high alert mode (it expires on May 31). One is not allowed to visit cemeteries due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It is forbidden to deliver deceased bodies with confirmed COVID-19 to relatives for farewell ceremony. In accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, the burial of those who dies of the coronavirus infection shall be carried out in closed coffins, and it is strictly forbidden to open them during the funeral.

Different regions of Russia practice different norms for the burial of coronavirus victims' bodies. In some regions, it is recommended to bury the deceased in closed coffins, in some others the authorities insist on zinc coffins or cremation, although cremation is not mandatory.

It is recommended to observe safety measures at all funerals, and direct tactile contacts with the body or the coffin of the deceased are prohibited. One is required to maintain social distancing and use personal protective equipment, like in any other public place. Employees of cemeteries, funeral agencies and funeral homes use special protective suits along with face masks and gloves.

Specially designated cemeteries provided for victims of Covid-19

Some regions of the Russian Federation have established regulations for funeral procedures against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Restrictions on the number of individuals who come to bid farewell at a funeral ceremony depend on the decision of the local authorities. For example, in North Ossetia, the presence of more than 50 people at a funeral is prohibited. In Moscow and the Moscow region, it is recommended to limit the number of people at funeral to 5-7 people maximum. In some parts of the country, those who died of coronavirus are buried at ordinary cemeteries, whereas in other regions, it is allowed to use only specially designated cemeteries. For example, in St. Petersburg, Mordovia and some other regions, special cemeteries and territories were assigned for victims of COVID-19.

Performing the autopsy of the body of the deceased is mandatory, and it is impossible to refuse from it, even if the deceased did not have the confirmed infection, but was only suspected for it.

The deceased bodies with the confirmed coronavirus are treated with a disinfectant. Afterwards, they are packed into double sealed bags, which are no longer allowed to open. Ordinary coffins are used – they can be treated with a disinfectant both on the outside and on the inside. At some cemeteries, coffins are sprinkled with bleach on the inside.

There are some funeral firms that started providing remote services, such as remote funerals, remote visiting of burial sites, remote flower laying, remote grave cleaning, etc.

Death certificates may not always indicate that the deceased was COVID-positive. The cause of death may be stated as cancer, heart failure, autoimmune diseases or other chronic diseases, which, in combination with COVID-19, have led to death.

As of May 12, 10,899 new infections were recorded in Russia. The total number of infected people in Russia since the beginning of the epidemic has exceeded 232,000 people. Over 2,000 people died, nearly 50,000 recovered.",fake

Singapore has introduced a mobile phone app to aid in contact tracing, for centuries the cornerstone of stopping epidemics, and says it will make the code available at no charge.

European nations have announced multiple initiatives to develop their own virus-fighting apps and other technology, some of them based on the Singapore model.

In the United States, though, we’re doing little to harness technology to defeat the pandemic, and we don’t seem to have a plan for controlling the virus other than keeping people home, doing more testing, and eventually coming up with a vaccine. What gives?

Dr. Richard Cooper, chair of the Health Sciences Department at the Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health at Loyola University Chicago, says he’s mystified. “The U.S. invented the smartphone,” he says. “That’s exactly the kind of thing that could be leveraged. Other countries are way ahead of us.”

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Social distancing and stay-at-home orders in much of the country have bought us essential time, at the cost of crippling the economy.

We can’t stay home indefinitely. But if we go back to business without rigorous measures to contain the coronavirus, the pandemic will start up all over again. As bad as the current outbreak may be, another one is likely next fall or early winter, as Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned.

A recent Harvard study suggests that without aggressive contact tracing and quarantining, the only way to control COVID-19 may be a strategy of intermittent lockdowns alternating with renewed outbreaks until “herd immunity” is built up, prolonging the pandemic into 2022 and resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths.

“That’s not a price anybody should consider paying,” Cooper says. “Contact tracing is one of the right and necessary things to do. You can’t just throw up your hands and say we have too many cases.”

Contact tracing and technology aren’t the only steps needed to prevent the pandemic from resuming once the initial outbreak is under control. Based on conversations with experts plus other research, here’s what I understand must be done before the stay-at-home order can be safely lifted.

Mass testing

Two types of tests are needed. The first is on-demand virus testing to determine if you’re infected with COVID-19 now.

The expert consensus is that Illinois needs to be able to administer at least 4,000 tests per day, about the same as South Korea did per capita during its successful campaign to halt the pandemic. Gov. J.B. Pritzker says the state has reached this level, although days-long delays in obtaining results remain a problem. The governor says he expects testing capacity to reach 10,000 per day by next week.

We need 10,000 tests a day in Illinois to get a better handle on how well the stay-at-home order is working — that’s the major intervention so far. The ultimate goal is to test everyone who needs a test on a regular basis.

The second type of test screens for blood antibodies to determine if you’ve ever had COVID-19, even if you’ve now recovered. The Food and Drug Administration has said it authorized use of a blood test made by Cellex Inc. Wide availability of such a test would likely take time.

Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are thought to be immune to the disease, at least temporarily, and could return to work or volunteer for emergency services. Knowing how much of the population has had COVID-19 would be valuable in determining measures to combat the virus.

Contact tracing

Contact tracing requires tracking down everyone known to have had contact with a COVID-19 patient in the past 14 days and testing them for the virus. The goal is to discover the “index case” — the first person who brought the disease into the community — and then trace out all subsequent links in the chain of transmission.

Traditional contact tracing is labor-intensive — “shoe leather epidemiology,” says Dr. Bala Hota, vice-president and chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center. It’s impractical once the virus is widespread, but becomes feasible again if the stay-at-home order works and the initial outbreak subsides.

“It would be really interesting to use technology” to eliminate some of the legwork, Hota says.

TraceTogether, a mobile app recently introduced in Singapore, uses Bluetooth technology to detect nearby phones that also have the app installed. To allay privacy concerns, records of contacts are encrypted and stored locally on the user’s phone, not sent to a central database. The app’s opening screen is shown in the illustration.

If a TraceTogether user becomes infected, public health authorities download and decrypt the data with the user’s permission and call close contacts, telling them to get tested.

Using the app is voluntary, but the public has a strong incentive to do so — they’re protecting their family, friends and fellow citizens, and are notified themselves if they come into contact with the virus. The app was launched on March 20 and now has 950,000 users, a Singapore government website says.

Singapore authorities have said they will make the code for the TraceTogether app available to software developers at no charge. European authorities are investigating a similar approach that will meet the European Union’s stringent privacy regulations.

Even if contact tracing technology comes into wide use, a sizable staff will be needed to call contacts and track down cases that slip through the cracks. A World Health Organization report on the coronavirus response in China found that 1,800 teams of at least five people each traced tens of thousands of contacts per day to help control the outbreak in Wuhan.

“We need to massively gear up the capacity to do contact tracing and surveillance,” Cooper says. “We need training and a command center to manage people.”

Quarantine

People testing positive for COVID-19 must be isolated while contagious. The same is true of visitors from other regions where the virus remains uncontrolled.

Most COVID-19 patients don’t require hospitalization and can self-quarantine on their own. Technology can be used to ensure compliance.

South Korea requires new arrivals to that country to submit to a 14-day quarantine that is monitored by a mandatory smartphone app that tracks their location. University of Illinois engineering grad Ryan Shin, now a tech entrepreneur in Seoul, provided a screenshot of the Korean quarantine tracking app, shown in the accompanying illustration.

Each quarantined individual is assigned a case officer, whose number must be entered into the app. Users are asked to report any symptoms; those who become seriously ill are taken to a hospital.

The app tracks the user’s location. If the system detects that a user has left quarantine, an alarm is sent to the case officer. Quarantine violators are taken into custody, Shin says.

Travel restrictions

Once the virus is under control locally, steps must be taken to prevent visitors from re-introducing the disease. This will require a range of measures both regionally and nationally.

International visitors may need to be quarantined, as in Korea, or given results-while-you-wait virus testing once kits become widely available.

The United Kingdom and Germany are considering “immunity passports” that would allow those who’ve recovered from COVID-19 to bypass restrictions.

Regional restrictions also will be needed within the U.S. to permit normal life to resume in areas where the virus is under control while preventing an influx of visitors from hot spots. In China, authorities set up roadblocks around Wuhan to prevent travel, an approach not likely to fly in the U.S.

In Chicago, an added complication is that the metropolitan area sprawls across three states, with commuters arriving in the Loop daily by train and car from Wisconsin and Indiana. To minimize checkpoints and delays, it may be necessary for the three states to jointly establish a regional pass system or the like until the crisis is over.

In the absence of national guidance, state and local governments will need to figure such things out on their own.

“Ideally what we need is a single plan that every country follows, but that’s not going to happen,” Cooper says. “Regional action could be effective — it obviously helps. Anything we can do, we should do.”

We have till the end of the stay-at-home order — currently set to expire April 30 — to implement a workable plan to prevent COVID-19 from returning. We’d better get on it.

Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical Left and Islamic terrorism.

In April, Governor Gretchen Whitmer posed and primped on The Daily Show in a “That Woman from Michigan” t-shirt as a narcissistic slam at President Trump. That same month, that woman from Michigan issued an executive order, that the Daily Show and SNL didn’t mention, ""protecting"" residents of long-term care facilities, by forcing nursing homes to admit patients infected with the coronavirus.

Her order dictated that a ""long-term care facility must not prohibit admission or readmission of a resident based on COVID-19 testing requirements or results"" and told hospitals to discharge coronavirus patients back to the homes they had come from. Some nursing homes were designated as ‘hubs’ and coronavirus patients were transferred into them, even though these facilities had uninfected residents.

Despite claims that these ‘hubs’ would carefully separate infected and uninfected patients, that didn’t always happen. While there had been a plan to move coronavirus seniors to the 1,000 bed TCF Center in Detroit which was being used as an overflow hospital for coronavirus patients, they were instead sent to nursing homes. The TCF Center only ended up treating 39 patients before being mothballed.

As of now, at least 687 nursing home residents in Michigan have died in the pandemic and 290 coronavirus patients have been placed in Michigan nursing homes. These numbers are incomplete.

Next time, Governor Whitmer goes on the Daily Show, she can wear a new t-shirt, “Grandma Killer”.

In New York, Governor Cuomo’s Health Department had issued an order on March 25th to ""expand hospital capacity"" by forcing nursing homes to ""comply with the expedited receipt of residents returning from hospitals to NHs"" and warned facilities that, ""no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.""

It took over 5,000 deaths for Cuomo to partially reverse his grandma-killing policy which had killed 5% of residents of nursing homes in the state. It was a partial reversal, because nursing homes still couldn’t remove infected patients, but hospitals were no longer allowed to discharge infected patients to homes.

Cuomo has argued that no one should be prosecuted for nursing home deaths because they would have died anyway. “Older people… are going to die from this virus,” he argued, dismissing the outrage of the families of the dead. “I don't think there's any logical rationale to say that they would be alive today.”

""We've tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it's virtually impossible,"" he falsely claimed.

His grandma-killing administration had tried everything, except providing protective equipment, not sending infected patients into nursing homes, or removing infected patients from nursing homes.

Cuomo had tried everything to stop killing grandmas, except not killing grandmas.

On March 31st, New Jersey Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli issued an order stating that in order to achieve ""the expedited receipt of patients/residents discharging from hospitals"", ""no patient/resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the post-acute care setting solely based on a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19."" It was a virtual copy of the earlier New York State order.

New Jersey’s own nursing home death toll is approaching New York’s 5,000 death toll.

10,000 dead grandmas and grandpas haven’t dented the media’s adoration for Cuomo and Murphy. To paraphrase another leftist, a single dead grandma is a tragedy, 10,000 dead grandmas are a statistic.

But before New York and New Jersey had even made their move, Governor Tom Wolf’s grandma-killing administration had ordered Pennsylvania nursing homes to accept ""readmissions for current residents who have been discharged from the hospital"" in order to ""alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings"" including ""patients who have had the COVID-19 virus.""

Wolf’s Secretary of Health, Dr. Richard (Rachel) Levine, had transferred his own mother out of a nursing home and to a hotel.

“Dr. Levine has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we do what we need to do in keeping Pennsylvanians safe,” Governor Wolf insisted.

That phenomenal job amounts to 2,529 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes or 68% of the state's deaths.

On March 30th, Governor Newsom’s administration warned skilled nursing facilities that they ""shall not refuse to admit or readmit a resident based on their status as a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case.""

“California’s directive is nothing less than a death sentence for countless residents,"" warned Patricia McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.

“I’m not taking in a COVID-positive patient for the sole purpose of emptying one hospital bed. In two weeks, I’m sending them back 20 new patients,” Dr. Noah Marco, the Chief Medical Officer of the Los Angeles Jewish Home, said. Half of California's deaths, or 1,276, have occurred in nursing homes, though not all are the SNFs that were ordered to accept coronavirus patients.

Whitmer, Cuomo, Wolf, and Newsom have been widely praised by the media, even though their disastrous policies likely led to the deaths of thousands of senior citizens in nursing homes. There were states that got it right, protecting senior citizens by barring the transfer of coronavirus patients to nursing homes, requiring negative tests before a transfer, and creating separate facilities.

Cuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, and Newsom, not only failed to protect nursing home residents, but their forced readmission policy brought infected patients directly into nursing homes, leading to mass death.

5% of the residents in New York nursing homes are dead, that’s grandma-killing on a genocidal scale.

While New York had banned testing as a basis for nursing home admission, in Florida, a “COVID-19 test must be negative prior to transfer to a post-acute facility”.

Governor DeSantis noted that his ban on sending coronavirus patients to nursing homes is the reason why the nursing home death toll was 13 times higher in New York and 25 times higher in New Jersey.

The media falsely claims that after at least 12,000 dead grandmas and grandpas Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did a wonderful job, and DeSantis did a terrible one. Their measure of success isn’t in grandmas saved, but in small businesses shut down, people terrified, and government power made absolute.

And if the media gets to write the history of the pandemic, that is what our children will be taught.

They will learn that in an emergency, wise governors listening to learned experts deprived people of their civil liberties and stopped a catastrophe that could have been much worse. That revisionist history will become the model for handling future crises. A big lie paid for in countless thousands of lives.

The big lie must not be allowed to stand and the truth must shake our political system until it rings.

""Who can we prosecute for those deaths? Nobody. Mother Nature, God?"" Cuomo asked rhetorically.

Governor Cuomo says that no one should be prosecuted for the nursing home deaths. He’s wrong. The prosecutions should begin with him and tear through the bureaucrats who made and implemented those decisions. Millions of people trusted Cuomo and other Democrat officials to keep them safe. Instead they seized power, abused their authority, and killed enough grandmas to fill miles of cemetery.

The grandma-killing governors must be brought to justice.

When a violent thug was shot by a police officer in a small city in Missouri, the Obama administration came down on Ferguson with an iron fist. How is it possible that thousands of nursing home residents can die, that grandmothers and grandfathers, that 127 veterans in New Jersey’s state-run nursing homes, that 5% of New York’s nursing home population can perish with less care than the concern about a thug?

What do we amount to as a country if we not only let that happen, but let them get away with it?

Thousands of men and women who worked all their lives and paid their taxes, who raised families, who wanted to watch their grandchildren grow up, died in large enough numbers that their bodies piled up in sheds, and the same nation that ground to a halt for Michael Brown and Freddie Gray shrugs. Where is even a fraction of the outrage that has been lavished on Ahmaud Aubrey for those thousands of wrinkled men and women, black and white, gasping out their last breaths in nursing home beds?

Cuomo, Whitmer, Murphy, and Newsom did not believe that they were worth saving. If we do not speak the truth, if we do not fight for justice for them, then are we as a nation really worth saving?",fake

But for those who don’t know, it means “deceased.” As in dead.

So you can imagine Janet Williams’ surprise last week when she received a $1,200 federal stimulus check in the mail made out to her late stepfather, “Arthur Keyser DECD.”

Opinion

Keyser died in November 2018, which the government apparently knew, Williams notes, BECAUSE IT SAYS SO RIGHT ON THE FACE OF THE $1,200 CHECK THEY SENT HIM.

It’s already been widely reported that the Treasury Department mistakenly sent out thousands of stimulus payments to dead people in its rush to get money out the door and revive the economy.

The explanation is there wasn’t time to cross reference the list of check recipients with the Social Security Administration’s death index, which is understandable to a point.

But couldn’t some computer whiz have fashioned a fairly simple program to weed out the people with “DECD” behind their names?

Keyser was hardly the only “DECD” person to get such a check with that fairly obvious clue printed right on the face. There have been similar anecdotal reports from other news outlets around the country, as well as from the mother-in-law of one of my bosses at the paper, which cinches it.

The question is what to do with such a check once it has been received.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Wall Street Journal that dead people aren’t eligible to collect the $1,200 and that their relatives and estates should repay the money to the government. Presumably, if they didn’t receive the money by direct deposit, they should just send back the check.

But others are questioning Mnuchin’s authority to make that determination, arguing the law passed by Congress makes no provision for the federal government to claw back stimulus funds sent in error.

The IRS issued detailed instructions Wednesday on how to return stimulus checks by mail or pay them back if they’ve already been deposited.

Williams, who lives in Roscoe Village and works for a medical trade association, said she does not plan to return the check, but neither does she intend to cash it.

“It’s more trouble for me than it’s worth to send it back,” she said, noting there’s no harm to the U.S. Treasury as long as the check isn’t cashed.

Plus, she said, “It’s a nice souvenir.”

Williams said the check came to her home address because she has power of attorney for Keyser’s estate and filed a tax return on its behalf for 2018, which is what triggered the stimulus payment.

Williams sees the check as emblematic of the incompetence of the Trump Administration on full display during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“They don’t understand public health. They don’t understand managing a public health crisis. They don’t understand national security and working with others around the world on solutions,” she said. “This is just another example of their ineptitude.”

Although I share her dim view of the president, it must be pointed out in all fairness that there were similar problems when the Obama Administration rushed out stimulus payments during the Great Recession in 2009.

The Social Security Administration inspector general reported a year later that the government had sent $18 million in stimulus checks to 72,000 dead people.

So maybe this just falls under the general heading of nonpartisan bureaucratic incompetence in Washington.

It would seem likely that with so many people hurting financially right now that many of them are going to cash their dead relatives’ checks and worry about the consequences later.

Count Williams among those who are doubtful the government will ever see that money in its coffers again, despite President Donald Trump’s assurance during a briefing last week that: “We’ll get that back.”

“If they didn’t cross reference those names to begin with, how do we believe they’re going to eventually catch up with the people who cash them,” she said.

As for the check to her stepfather, she thinks about all the other people who could benefit from that money right now.",real
344,1101,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/15/opinion-coronavirus-radically-alters-doctor-contact-with-patients/,2020-05-15,Opinion: Coronavirus radically alters doctor contact with patients,"For primary care physicians, laying hands on patients builds connection and trust. The physical exam is both a ritual and a privilege of the doctor-patient relationship, forged out of the assumption that it can guide treatment to improve the patient’s health.

But social distancing of the COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered the way we connect with each other physically – and the way doctors interact with their patients.

When the Bay Area in March implemented a shelter-in-place policy to contain the spread of COVID-19, Alameda County’s Highland Hospital scrambled to comply. Literally overnight, our whole model of providing primary care transformed: We had to find ways to treat patients from a distance. Within a few days, we pivoted from providing exclusively office visits to conducting 90% of appointments by phone.

Such a rapid transformation would have been previously unimaginable. Despite technology that allows us to phone or video conference from almost anywhere across the globe, healthcare delivery systems have been slow to embrace telemedicine platforms. In December 2018, the American Medical Association reported that only 15% of physicians work in organizations that use telemedicine to care for patients.

Financial barriers were partly to blame for the poor adoption of telehealth among many safety-net institutions. A 2019 report by the RAND Corporation showed that most safety-net systems lost money on telemedicine because reimbursement was much lower than for office visits.

Humboldt County coronavirus protester’s ‘slaves’ sign goes viral Such barriers, however, have faded into the background in the setting of a global pandemic. COVID-19 has been a catalyst revolutionizing healthcare delivery over a matter of days rather than years.

Just as healthcare organizations have had to adapt to COVID-19, I find patients are equally flexible and resilient. When I call patients for a telephone visit, they are grateful. Many of my patients have mobility problems or take multiple buses to get to clinic; they appreciate the convenience of remaining home while also having their health needs addressed.

During this pandemic, patients are safer in their own houses. One of my patients recently commented: “Thank you for calling, doctor. I am glad we could talk over the phone so I don’t risk exposing myself.”

The positive experience reported by our patients is consistent with published data on the subject. Massachusetts General Hospital, which has provided telehealth services since 2012, boasts remarkable patient and provider satisfaction with its program.

To be sure, certain conditions require a physical exam to truly understand what is going on. And regular face-to-face contact will continue to be the foundation of any therapeutic relationship. Office visits are not obsolete, but it is my hope that COVID-19 will permanently transform the way we provide care, even after the pandemic has passed. The flexibility to choose between an in-person assessment and a telehealth visit is good for patients.

Financial incentives will be essential to maintaining telehealth services over the long term for public hospital systems such as Highland. On March 18, the California Department of Managed Care issued an unprecedented directive to its health plans to “reimburse providers at the same rate, whether a service is provided in-person or through telehealth.”

Reimbursing remote visits on a par with office visits will help safety-net organizations stay afloat financially during this crisis. It is unclear, however, whether reimbursement on this scale will continue after COVID-19 has died down. Continuing to robustly reimburse telehealth post-COVID-19 will sustain the tremendous innovation and improvement that has proved to be the bright side of this pandemic.

And it will help us stay close to patients, even at a distance.

By Julie Steenhuysen

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two studies in monkeys published on Wednesday offer some of the first scientific evidence that surviving COVID-19 may result in immunity from reinfection, a positive sign that vaccines under development may succeed, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

Although scientists have assumed that antibodies produced in response to the new coronavirus virus are protective, there has been scant scientifically rigorous evidence to back that up.

In one of the new studies, researchers infected nine monkeys with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. After they recovered, the team exposed them to the virus again and the animals did not get sick.

The findings suggest that they ""do develop natural immunity that protects against re-exposure,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, whose studies were published in the journal Science.

""It's very good news,"" Barouch said.

Several research teams have released papers - many of them not reviewed by other scientists - suggesting that a vaccine against the virus would be effective in animals.

In the second study, Barouch and colleagues tested 25 monkeys with six prototype vaccines to see if antibodies produced in response were protective.

They then exposed these monkeys and 10 control animals to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the novel coronavirus.

All of the control animals showed high degrees of virus in their noses and lungs, but in the vaccinated animals, ""we saw a substantial degree of protection,"" Barouch said. Eight of the vaccinated animals were completely protected.

These studies, which have been peer reviewed, do not prove that humans develop immunity or how long it might last, but they are reassuring.

""These data will be seen as a welcome scientific advance,"" Barouch said.

Short. Daily. We take you behind the headlines and help you understand the biggest stories driving politics and policy.

The effort was part of a nationwide effort to ramp up ventilator production following concerns there were not enough ventilators to match the surge of coronavirus patients. The buoyed reserve that has resulted has now a point of pride for the administration. The president has called himself the “king of ventilators” and plans to send some of the expensive machines to other countries facing shortages. The Rawsonville plant has promised to manufacture 50,000 ventilators by July 4.

Yet the visit was not without controversy.

In the days leading up to it, questions were raised about whether or not the president would wear a mask while touring the facility, as the Ford plant requires for safety reasons. Trump previously opted to not wear a mask during a visit last week to the medical equipment factory in Pennsylvania.

Ford initially released a statement saying the plant notified the White House of its mask requirement, then later clarified the decision would be left to the White House. Michigan’s attorney general then wrote an open letter to the president saying it was his “legal responsibility” to wear a protective face covering, given current state orders.

“I ask that while you are on tour you respect the great efforts of the men and women at Ford — and across this state — by wearing a facial covering,” wrote Attorney General Dana Nessel.

On Thursday, Ford issued a statement saying CEO Bill Ford ""encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived,"" and that the president complied ""during a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years.""

The statement added: ""The president later removed the mask for the remainder of the visit.”

The president also lobbed political grenades at Michigan’s Democratic leaders earlier this week.

On Wednesday, Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from Michigan after accusing the state, without evidence, of “illegally” sending absentee ballots to voters.

“This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State,” Trump tweeted. “I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”

Later, he corrected his tweet — the state is sending only applications for absentee ballots, not actual ballots — and said it might not be necessary to withhold any funds. But he still expressed anger over the state’s strategy on Thursday, claiming without evidence at several points that it would lead to fraud.

“We don't want anyone to do mail-in ballots,” he said before departing the White House. “Now, if someone has to mail it in because they're sick or by the way because they live in the White House and they have to vote on Florida, and they won't be in Florida and there's a reasoning for it, that's OK.”

The president’s visit also comes at a fraught time for the state as Midland County, located north of Detroit, faces catastrophic flooding that has forced thousands to evacuate their homes. Trump’s schedule did not include a visit to the devastated area. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was not invited to meet the president while he was on the ground in Michigan.

Trump on Thursday offered assurances that the federal government would support the local recovery, including with Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers.",real

Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th) said he convened a Monday meeting between the building owner and the commander of the CPD’s Grand Central District, who issued the woman “a couple citations for public nuisance and gave her strict warnings and we also have just put her on notice.”

Video footage of the weekend party in the 2000 block of North Narragansett quickly went viral. Clips posted to Facebook showed dozens of people crammed into the home, with everyone standing in very close proximity and hardly anyone wearing protective masks.

Villegas — Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s floor leader in City Council — said the party was the doing of the building owner’s adult son. The owner’s son had a set of keys to the building and was able to disarm the home’s alarm system. It was the second party he’s thrown in the building in recent weeks, Villegas said.

The home, in Chicago’s Galewood community, is in Villegas’ ward.

Earlier in the day, Lightfoot vowed to “get to the bottom” of the party — and hold everyone involved accountable for the public health risk.

Lightfoot said the city is “still in the midst of the investigation to identify the specific location” of the party, captured on a shocking Facebook video that already had been viewed more than a million times before it was taken down Monday.

The party is believed to have taken place somewhere on the West Side, but City Hall is still “nailing down specifics,” she said.

The mayor argued “everybody involved” in the party “bears a level of responsibility” and will ultimately be held accountable.

“When you see a scene like that where you have, literally, it looked to me, like hundreds of people gathered in a small, confined space literally cheek-to-jowl like that, it goes against all of the things we’ve been talking about. All of the things that the vast majority of Chicagoans understand and know,” the mayor said.

“They put themselves at risk. But not only that. Every single person there who put themselves at risk puts the next person and the next person that they come into contact with at risk. That’s why, for me, that scene is so distressing. But, we’ll get to the bottom of it.”

Lightfoot pointed to “Zoom chats” and other opportunities for young people to connect using social media. She said the city plans to “step up and do a lot over the course of the summer, depending on where we are in the arc of this virus” and how much the stay-at-home order is relaxed. But she argued a shortage of organized teen activities is no excuse to flout the statewide, stay-at-home order.

“What happened in that scene was just foolish and reckless. There’s got to be a level of personal responsibility for that. Millenials aren’t children. Millenials—many of `em—are in their 20’s. They’re fully functioning adults. And we expect adults to act responsibly—particularly at a time of pandemic,” the mayor said.

Videographer Tink Purcell captured the chaotic Saturday night party scene from halfway up a staircase and streamed it live on Facebook for about 24 minutes.

Some partygoers were wearing face masks, but most were not. Social distancing was out the window as those in attendance danced and drank elbow-to-elbow while lines formed at the front door and on the stairs.

The mayor was asked how she plans to prevent similarly unauthorized house parties as temperatures rise and cabin fever builds.

“I can’t prevent people from being foolish. I wish I had that kind of power. What we can do ... is educate people about why taking those kinds of risks are unnecessary and foolish, talk about personal responsibility and then, where we see it, take decisive action and make sure that we shut it down,” Lightfoot said.

“I have no compunction about setting the appropriate example in egregious situations like we saw. Not just in that event, but there were several other large-scale parties that the police department was called upon to break up over the weekend. We’re not gonna set the standard for the summer and warmer weather by allowing people to flout all the public health guidance we’ve been giving.”",real

But they are strangely silent about a story staring them right in the face.

In February and early March, it was clear from events unfolding in Washington State that retirement homes were particularly vulnerable to this outbreak. This should hardly come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the risk that even more mundane illnesses can trigger life-threatening cases of pneumonia, considering that this virus specifically inflames the lower respiratory tract.

As of March 26th, a letter to the WSJ and a phone call to the Mark Levin Show by a nursing home administrator in New York strenuously protested Cuomo’s new order that obligated nursing homes to accept infectious coronavirus patients into their care.

Tragically, Gov Cuomo later dismissed any objections as financially motivated in his press conferences. At the time, the objection was raised, she was unable to get any New York officials to listen — and unable to contact any parties directly.

The consequences following that fateful order were every bit as devastating as they were predictable.

Janice Dean, Senior Meteorologist at Fox News, shared her story on Twitter — one that puts a personal face on the horrors unfolding in a much-neglected story.

It said:

Dear friends,

As most of you know, both of my husband’s parents died of covid in different nursing/assisted living residences here in New York. Because of this, it’s hard for me to be an objective person when it comes to this story. But the fact is, there aren’t a lot of news outlets covering this tragedy which I believe should be one of the biggest stories of the covid19 pandemic of 2020. So, please forgive me for my raw horror, grief and fury. If there’s anything I can say having lived through this, is that I will do my best to be a voice for all those who don’t have one. There needs to be a real investigation into how bad decisions and poor preparation let a virus ravage our most vulnerable. They had no way to defend themselves, and it will haunt my family forever.

This is the same Gov Cuomo who looked directly into the camera — two days before that WSJ article pleaded with New York not to send infectious patients into nursing homes — and ironically told us, ‘My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable.’

Whether he realized it or not, his own decisions MADE them expendable now, didn’t they?

Somehow New York’s Cuomo — so beloved of the media — and the roundly demonized DeSantis handled their most vulnerable populations quite differently. Unlike New York and a few other states, Florida issued no order compelling nursing homes to accept infectious patients. The doomsday scenario they said would certainly befall Florida never materialized… certainly not on the scale the Chicken Little crowd had predicted.

The Nursing Home fatality statistic has become so humiliating for Cuomo that his administration quietly changed the reporting rules for Nursing Home fatalities so that it wouldn’t reflect so poorly on him. Cuomo’s Officials Caught Cooking The Books On Nursing Home Deaths

It’s curious, isn’t it, that media types so hellbent on attributing the responsibility of each and every death to the President so easily gloss over specific policy choices that endangered — or even ended — so very many innocent lives.

According to NY Times data on nursing homes, the states where ""new cases are increasing"" have the highest share of nursing home deaths from COVID-19 (52% vs 35%). Yet we continue to focus on beach activity and blanket lockdowns as opposed to protecting those in nursing homes. — James Todaro, MD (@JamesTodaroMD) May 20, 2020

Hopefully, stories like the tragic one of Janice Dean’s in-laws perishing in a potentially preventable situation will make this issue personal enough that it won’t be waved away by the ‘mainstream’ press as just another cold statistic.

Sometimes, a personal story is the only way to effectively carry a message through an otherwise noisy news cycle.

If you doubt the truth of that, ask yourself — how many people remember the 10,000 massacred in Tianmen Square. And how many remember that one iconic photo of ‘Tank Man’?

Keep sharing your stories.

And some of us will do what we can to make sure others hear them too. It’s the only way that those lives were endangered by their own government will have their story told, and will see, perhaps, some small measure of justice after the fact.

It's okay. One man's revenge porn is just the media's whistleblowing.

You may remember yesterday when the media decided to turn Rebekah Jones, a dubious character, into a heroic whistleblowing data scientist.

Jones claimed that she was fired from her job, inputting coronavirus numbers into the state dashboard, because Florida was covering up the ""real"" coronavirus numbers.

And the media embraced her.

She was the new prog heroine.

Rachel Maddow featured her. CNN wrote her up. ""Florida Ousts COVID-19 Data Scientist,"" NPR shrieked, as if Jones were researching a cure, instead of typing numbers into a box.

Gov. Ron DeSantis didn’t know who Rebekah Jones was Tuesday afternoon when reporters asked him for comment on her firing. But by Wednesday afternoon, the Governor offered an authoritative prosecution of the case for firing Jones, who had worked on the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, with cause. DeSantis disparaged her, saying she’s “not even a data scientist … not involved in collating data, she lacks the expertise to do that. She is not an epidemiologist. She is not the chief architect of our web portal, that’s another false statement.”

Surprise, surprise. It was all a bunch of fake news lies.

Jones was more like the drywall hanger of the dashboard rather than the “architect.” The dashboard was built on the same visual mapping tool that Johns Hopkins University made famous at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. In fact, Florida’s tool looks extremely similar. That’s because Johns Hopkins University is not the “architect” of the dashboard, either. The tool is actually built not on any of Florida’s many data servers, but using ready-made modules from a subscription service called ArcGIS. Jones’ job was to load data into those modules and decide how it appeared to visitors.

The great and inspiring ""Data Scientist"" appears to have some issues that might explain why she was fired.

On June 13, 26-year-old University staff member Rebekah Jones was booked on one count of battery on a police officer, one count of remaining after forbidden and two counts of resisting arrest, Scott said. Scott said officers arrived at the Sea Grant building when Jones refused to leave at the request of LSU Human Resources. Scott said Jones initiated physical contact against two LSUPD officers while resisting arrest and officers were forced to subdue her. Jones also has an extensive criminal history in Leon County, where she’s been arrested and charged with three felonies, including one for robbery, and a handful of misdemeanor cases including “sexual cyberstalking,” a case where she created a website and used it to sexually harass her ex-boyfriend. The website has been taken down, but images from the case exist in Leon County court records. Most of the charges filed against her came after she was hired by the Department of Health, so they would not have turned up in any background check.

Does this get worse? It's the media trying to nail De Santis. Of course it gets worse.

A police report from Tallahassee Police shows a man claimed to be a victim of revenge porn by Jones in June of 2019. The man told police he had an injunction against Jones for a year until it recently expired.

The Labour Party has demanded a ""swift explanation"" from Boris Johnson's team, after a joint investigation by The Guardian and the Daily Mirror was released claiming the prime minister's top adviser Dominic Cummings flouted the self-isolation rules he himself helped to craft.

""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel"", a Labour spokesperson commented on the reports, adding that double standards are not permissible with regard to state-issued rules:

""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings"", the press service stated.

While Downing Street hasn't yet commented on the said investigation, speculation is running high over its staffer's political future, as well as general credibility bearing in mind that he is said to have been personally behind the counter-COVID measures.

""Following the news that Dominic Cummings travelled from London to Durham during lockdown and his behaviour was investigated by the police, his position is completely untenable - he must resign or be sacked"", SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford said.

In a series of tweets, Mr Blackford said: ""This is a key test of leadership for Boris Johnson. People must have confidence that the Tory government is following its own rules - not being investigated by the police for breaking them"", going on to state that millions would find it ""completely incredible that Boris Johnson's most senior adviser has been breaking his own government's rules"".

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey echoed the stance, suggesting that the way out is crystal clear: ""If Dominic Cummings has broken the lockdown guidelines he will have to resign"".

""One law for them another for the rest"", Labour MP Angela Eagle tweeted, while her colleague delved into greater detail pointing out:

""So we can now take children from a household where people have tested positive to stay with the likely over 70s? Missed that exemption in the guidance"", she fumed.

Piers Morgan, in his typically fiery manner, called for Johnson to take countermeasures:

""Fire him tonight prime minister - or why should anybody heed your lockdown rules?"", he asked, before going on:

""Boris Johnson must have known where Cummings was self-isolating. Why did you let your chief adviser break your lockdown rules, prime minister?""

The Daily Mail, meanwhile, has cited Cummings’ ""close friend"" as saying that he couldn't be bothered less with the reports:

""It's more fake news from The Guardian. There is zero chance of him resigning"", the friend concluded.

The newspaper reports suggest, citing sources that, Johnson's right-hand man was questioned by the Durham Constabulary on 31 March after travelling to where his parents reside, which is over 200 miles from his London home, just a day after he was seen in Westminster with a Downing Street spokesperson confirming he had been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. Sources assumed that the 48-year-old Number 10 staffer made the long trip to the North East so his parents could take care of his young son if he and his wife, who were both displaying symptoms, were unable to look after him - something the couple reportedly believed was not prohibited under the new rules.

The police reportedly investigated the matter and found the said individual was staying in ""part of a house"" at a Durham address, and in line with national policing guidance, ""officers explained to the family the arrangements around self-isolation guidelines and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel"".

Separately, media outlets suggest a local resident was ""shocked"" to catch a glimpse of Cummings, ""a distinctive figure"", on the doorstep of his parents' home with a child believed to be his son on 5 April.

Breaches of lockdown rules have recently led to a number of high-profile resignations.

For instance, Scotland's chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood quit her post after it emerged she had twice visited a second home in Fife.

Also, Professor Neil Ferguson, one of the government's top scientific advisers, resigned from the SAGE committee after a woman from the outside was reported to have visited his home at least twice.",fake
388,1405,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/05/19/nascar-sticking-close-its-roots-might-be-smart-even-after-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-05-19,"For NASCAR, sticking close to its roots might be smart even after the coronavirus pandemic","In the 70 years since it opened, there has never been another top-of-the-sport track that mirrored Darlington Raceway, and therefore there aren’t races elsewhere like there are at Darlington. No two turns are the same. The walls, they come up on you quick. The car can win at some tracks. The driver must win at “The Track Too Tough to Tame.”

Yet Darlington, like so much about NASCAR’s unique and colorful roots, has been disrespected and disregarded by its top decision-makers — until those decision-makers needed old standbys to come through. The original 2020 NASCAR schedule had one race in the elite Cup Series at “The Lady in Black,” which is one more than at the similarly historic tracks abandoned years ago in North Wilkesboro and Rockingham, N.C.





Somewhere along the road to becoming a chic mainstream sport, NASCAR lost its soul. Maybe a pandemic could help NASCAR rediscover it.

NASCAR became the first major U.S. sport to hold a regular season, this-really-counts event in two months when it staged a 400-mile race at Darlington on Sunday. It’ll follow with another Darlington race Wednesday night, doubling the number of Cup races the track was scheduled to host this year in a matter of four days.

Study the revised and still-evolving schedule — altered, of course, by the novel coronavirus pandemic that has changed every aspect of our lives — and note the tracks that are hosting seven Cup races between now and June 10: Darlington, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway. That right there is the heart of NASCAR’s old footprint. That right there is where any post-pandemic schedule should be based.





I’m not going to pretend I follow the inner workings of NASCAR on a week-by-week — or, at this point, even a season-by-season — basis. But for most of two seasons, I covered this traveling circus for the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C. They weren’t just any two seasons, either. They were 1999 and 2000, right when NASCAR was rocketing into widespread mainstream popularity, right when it was spreading to markets in every region of the nation, right when NBC and Fox combined to grant it a massive national television contract, right when it was losing its way before it could realize what was happening.

The rejiggered NASCAR schedule for this season is designed completely around the pandemic. These first seven Cup races are within easy driving distance of the headquarters for the vast majority of race teams, which is the Concord, N.C., area, just north of Charlotte. The idea is to limit competition to one day — no qualifying, no practice, just racin’ — and eliminate air travel and hotel stays.

There’s an opportunity within: What if, in the aftermath of all this, we relearn that — at least from a sports perspective — geography and the culture associated with it matter?





NASCAR originally grew from the rural South, where clever and resourceful mechanics souped up cars for bootleggers so they could outrun the law in dry counties. There was a creative rebelliousness about it all, and the cunning that went into speeding away from Smokey to deliver moonshine ended up in the NASCAR garage, where real American ingenuity took the shape of bent — and outright broken — rules, all in the name of making a car go fast. How original. How fun.

Just before the turn of this century, more people started to sense that originality and that fun. NASCAR pounced. What once was a regional sport with its headquarters in Daytona Beach, Fla., and its heart in the Carolinas expanded — quickly — into a national brand. The advertisers in New York wanted a piece and, in turn, NASCAR wanted a piece of Hollywood. New offices developed in Manhattan and Los Angeles. New sponsors elbowed each other out of the way. Disney made “Cars.” Will Ferrell made “Talladega Nights.” NASCAR knew no bounds.

With more demand came more supply, and the race calendar bulged. New markets percolated from coast to coast. There was money! There was attention! There was growth! In 1993, what was then known as the Winston Cup Series held 20 points races in seven southeastern states and 10 more spread among seven states, with just two races west of the Mississippi. NASCAR knew where its biscuits were buttered.





By 2005, by which time the top series had been renamed the Nextel Cup, regional loyalty and identity had been abandoned. A bursting-at-the-seams 36-race schedule featured 16 points races in those seven southeastern states — Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina — and the remaining 20 spread across a dozen states, with nine races west of the Mississippi.

And it wasn’t just the new markets that seemed like a cash grab. It was the construction of new tracks, so many of them nearly identical “tri-ovals” that served to maximize more expensive seating on long frontstretches, with the requisite corporate and sponsor boxes above the masses. No minnow pond would ever get in the way again.

What’s clear now was only predictable by pessimists back when I covered NASCAR: It ended up with a watered-down product on boring tracks spread across the country in front of fan bases that didn’t care as much, if they cared at all. By 2018, television ratings hit an all-time low. NASCAR stopped announcing in-person attendance. Many tracks removed grandstands. In pursuing new fans, NASCAR alienated its base.





Maybe the restructuring forced by the pandemic could win it back.

There’s really no way to tell what any specific sport will look like assuming we get to the other side of all this, but it just seems foolish to assume it’ll be precisely as it was when 2020 dawned. In a sense, the pandemic should force leagues to consider not only what’s best for the rest of this year but how they might improve well beyond.

After Wednesday night, the next two races on the Cup schedule are at Charlotte, which might not be the most interesting layout but at least is at the sport’s geographic epicenter and cultural core. Beyond, there’s the variety of the short tracks of Bristol and Martinsville. In late June comes the monstrous superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., as fast as the sport can go. Embrace it.



Why not grow by shrinking? Race at Richmond and Atlanta, Daytona and Bristol, even Darlington again. Even without fans in the stands, pander to the base in hopes of recapturing it again, especially when there are precious few sporting alternatives to focus on.

396,1399,https://www.healthnutnews.com/italians-urge-g20-nations-to-join-trump-in-defunding-w-h-o/,2020-05-19,Breitbart: Italians Urge G20 Nations to Join Trump in Defunding W.H.O.,"More than 200,000 Italians have signed a petition to cut all funding to the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) from G20 nations.

The CitizenGO petition is addressed to the heads of G20 nations, and reads:

“We humbly ask you to join U.S. President Donald J. Trump to stop sending funds to the World Health Organization.”1

According to Breitbart, the appeal says that the W.H.O.’s relationship with China is unfavorable, stating:

“that it supports and disseminates the false and incomplete information released by Communist China regarding the seriousness of COVID19” and “the W.H.O. internal decision-making and management processes are not subject to direct control by taxpayers.”1

Furthermore, the appeal notes that during the peak of the spread of Chinese coronavirus, W.H.O. has continued to use contributions paid with public funds for promoting abortion worldwide as a human right, supporting the legalization of prostitution, forcing doctors to perform sex reassignment surgery on children, and disseminating a curriculum for global sexuality standards that teaches masturbation to small children.

RELATED S TORY:

RELATED STORY:

Currently, Italy is the seventh-largest national funder of the W.H.O., behind the U.S.A., China, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, according to the appeal, which also states:

“To compensate for the loss of funds from U.S. contributions, W.H.O. and its ideological allies are calling for an increase in voluntary donations from other countries. And the G20 countries are at the top of the list.” “We don’t need a global ‘health’ organization that pumps billions out of our society every year to harm children,” it declares. “And President Trump’s plan to cut funding to the W.H.O. offers us a real opportunity to start seeing the end of their global agenda, that same agenda that does nothing but trample on human dignity and its true value.”1

If President Trump follows through with his promise to stop U.S. funding to W.H.O., the organization will suffer the loss of $419 million, which accounts for 15 percent of its annual budget, the appeal notes.

RELATED STORY:

On Monday, President Trump warned the World Health Organization that it will permanently lose U.S. funding unless it commits to “major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.”1

When Trump suspended U.S. funding of the U.N. subsidiary, he cited its role in “mismanaging and covering up” the global spread of the coronavirus, saying at the White House:

“They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer. They gave us a lot of bad advice.”1

Trump wrote to W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus indicating he will reconsider America’s support of the organization only after numerous improvements are made, first and foremost dropping ties with China. Breitbart reports the letter said:

“It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world.”1

Parents ask: Who will watch our children?,"Carlos Atkins, 27, used to spend weekdays with his 2-year-old son Malachi, taking walks and reading books, before heading out into the night to power wash sidewalks, pick up trash and remove graffiti in downtown Detroit for a local nonprofit. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the city and his son’s day care center but not Atkins’ job as an essential worker. After being reassigned to a midday shift that ends at 9 pm, he’s scrambled to find child care, leaning heavily on his mom and aunt.

Even clad in a jumpsuit, gloves and mask, his line of work carries health risks and he’s fearful of bringing home the deadly virus to the two-family flat he shares with his son, mother and younger sister. And, fiercely protective of his young charge, he wonders whether his son should return to day care when Michigan reopens.

“It’s overwhelming. I try not to focus on it,” Atkins says. “I just hope and pray for the best.”

What schools will look like when they reopen:Scheduled days home, more online learning, lots of hand-washing

When will schools reopen?:Not soon, education leaders say, despite Trump's declarations

The push to reboot the nation’s economy is leaving millions of parents like Atkins in a tough bind. They can’t go back to work without someone to care for their children, whether preschools or day care facilities, babysitters or relatives. And, even if they can find child care, they’re worried states are moving too quickly and may be putting their kids’ lives at risk.

Last week the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an extension of the state’s stay-at-home order. In some places, employees are being called back to work before child care facilities open.

Lack of child care is quickly emerging as one of the biggest barriers to the economy bouncing back, says Patricia Cole, senior director of federal policy for Zero to Three, a nonprofit focused on early childhood development.

“Child care is foundational to our nation’s ability to recover from this crisis,” Cole said during a news briefing put on by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

COVID-19 plunges child care system into crisis

COVID-19 has plunged the child care industry, 90% of which is privately run, into a crisis the likes of which the nation has never seen.

Already child care centers were expensive to operate and stayed afloat on meager profits. Caregivers and other staffers, a third of whom have been laid off, often get by on poverty wages and public assistance, unable to afford child care for their own children.

Now child care advocates argue the nation’s already fragile system is at risk of collapse. They are lobbying for billions more in federal aid to ensure reliable child care is available to parents.

Though in many places they were not required to close, since the pandemic began, nearly half of child care facilities nationwide have shut down, some of them indefinitely as the coronavirus forced families to keep kids at home, according to a survey of child care providers conducted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Seventeen percent of providers have closed to everyone except the children of essential personnel. Of the facilities which have remained open, 85% are operating at less than 50% of enrollment capacity and the majority of those are operating at less than 25% of capacity, the survey conducted in April found.

“We don't fully know yet who are the child care providers and facilities that are not going to have survived this economic crisis because they just couldn't keep the doors open,” says Javaid Siddiqi, CEO of The Hunt Institute, an education nonprofit in Cary, North Carolina.

It’s also unclear how many providers will be able to afford to reopen or at what capacity with strict new health protocols that vary from state to state. Some new rules limit the number of children that can be in any group – and in many cases require the same children and adults be placed together every day. Child care centers also face higher costs for additional staffing, personal protective equipment, hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies.

Summer camps and programs have also fallen on hard times and are being driven out of business. The ones still standing are trying to figure out if or how they can reopen safely.

Half of facilities closed, remaining providers stretched

Child care providers that have remained open to watch over the children of essential workers are stretched to the breaking point.

Crystal Perry-Grant, a 38-year-old mother of three, runs a family day care in Perris, California, a small city in Riverside County. For 12-hour stretches with the help of her 17-year-old daughter, she cares for eight children whose parents are essential workers from firefighters to UPS workers, ranging in age from 1 to 9.

School-age kids learn remotely on six computers that routinely slow her Wi-Fi to a crawl. She cooks homemade soups from fresh farm produce to boost their immune systems. Hand sanitizer squirted liberally throughout the day into little palms has kept sickness at bay. In the past two months, she hasn’t had even a single runny nose.

“Our parents need us. They don’t have family around. It’s a dire need. I would feel bad if I closed,” Perry-Grant says. “No one had a job they could up and quit, so I couldn’t either.”

But Perry-Grant can’t take on any more children. She has no openings and a long waiting list.

“This goes very much to the heart of whether we are going to be able to just reopen the economy,” says Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress who studies the child care industry. “There are a lot of reasons why we can't just flip a switch and this is very high on the list.”

For Demetriss “Demi” DeShazior, a 41-year-old medical assistant in Miami, child care tops her list of concerns.

Her mother babysat her 2-year-old while DeShazior languished on a long waiting list for partially subsidized child care. When she was seven months pregnant, DeShazior learned she’d secured a spot, but this was a month before the pandemic hit. Before she could finish filling out the paperwork, child care facilities closed.

So DeShazior took family medical leave earlier than she planned in March to stay home with her son. Now she's applying for child care for her toddler and 5-week-old as an essential health worker but her unease is growing.

“If I do return to work, will my babies be safe from contracting COVID-19 at day care?"" DeShazior wonders. “Will I even have day care covered for both babies by my return date?”

Nation cannot reopen with kids still at home

Even before the coronavirus tore across the country, parents scrambled to find child care. With too few spots to meet demand, the burden fell heaviest on low-wage parents, women and families of color. Now millions more spots may have evaporated.

Traditional backstops such as grandparents who used to step in to care for children while parents worked belong to populations most vulnerable to the coronavirus.

“Most states are talking about child care, but there’s a mixed bag in terms of how many are actually being planful about it. When you as a state say, ‘we’re open,’ but then you don’t give guidance around child care, that puts the burden of the situation on families,” says NAEYC's CEO Rhian Evans Allvin. And that, Allvin, says, “exacerbates the already existing inequities in early childhood education because inherently wealthier families have more options.”

As more parents prepare to return to work, the enormousness of the challenge facing the nation’s patchwork child care system is staggering.

Four in 10 working adults have children under 18. Nearly 60% of children under 5 participated in regular weekly care arrangements and a third were enrolled in a child care program of some kind before the coronavirus struck. Yet, with many child care providers from small family day cares to after-school programs closing up shop indefinitely, parents are at loose ends.

“Parents who are being called back into work at this point really may find challenges in securing care or even, in some cases, securing the care they were accustomed to,” says Dan Wuori, director of early learning at The Hunt Institute, which has a database tracking state child care policies.

Among those parents is Laura Byrd, 35, a human resources generalist from Newark, New Jersey and mother of a 7-year-old who’s been working from home since the start of the pandemic.

“Our ‘new normal’ will pose some difficulties once I am instructed to return to the office. As the state reopens, our day care centers and summer camps will not be operating which will create child care issues for me,” says Byrd, who’s considering taking a leave of absence if necessary.

Agonizing choices between health risks and paychecks

Reopening is forcing parents in Georgia, Florida and other states into an agonizing choice between potentially risking their health and the health of their children and earning a paycheck.

Late at night and in the early morning hours, Christy Moreno, 39, a bilingual editorial director, squeezes a stress ball while sending work emails from her Kansas City, Missouri, home.

Her makeshift office is a small round table in the corner of her dining room covered in stray crayons and device chargers. This single mother of two, ages 10 and 13, balances overseeing her children’s education and counseling Latino parents working in hotels and restaurants on how to find child care. On social media, parent groups are overflowing with worry and confusion: What are families supposed to do?

Anxieties are running especially high for parents whose children have health conditions that put them at higher risk for the coronavirus. Many can’t afford lower-risk options such as babysitters and nannies or having one parent stay home. These parents say even if they can find child care, they don’t know if they should send their kids. Some employees can take sick leave or expanded family and medical leave if they are caring for a child when schools and day care centers are closed under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which was signed into law in March, but not everyone has that option.

“Parents are being forced into this Catch-22,” says Keri Rodrigues, founding president of the National Parents Union, a network of parent organizations across the country. “They feel a desperate need to go back to work but at the same time they are terrified of this deadly virus.”

Parents worry: Is it safe to send kids back to child care?

Laid off in March, Rachel Jean-Pierre is a single mother of two in Union, New Jersey. If she’s called back to her job in New York City as a guest service manager in July, she will have to find a family member to help care for her children, ages 6 and 9, both of whom have asthma.

“With the government reopening the economy with no confirmed solution to this pandemic, I am torn between wanting my children to return to their normal schedules and wanting to keep them safe,” she says. “Until the country has really grabbed hold of this pandemic, as a parent with children who suffer from asthma, I would rather be safe than sorry.”

Conflicting messages have not helped parents make these tough calls. While President Donald Trump pushes governors to work to reopen schools, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned in Senate testimony last week, ""We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children.""

It’s week 11 of quarantine for Naomi Nedd, a 49-year-old mother and contract negotiator for a managed care plan in Queens. She’s resorted to bribing her 3-year-old son with gummy bears and screen time when she has to write a contract or jump on a Zoom call. Once he falls asleep at 7:30 pm, she digs in for hours to make a dent in her workload.

“I went into this thinking, my kid is home, it will be fine. But it’s so different when you are trying to be the professional you are when you’ve left your child at day care than when you are at a dining room table with a 3-year-old who just knows you’re mommy,” Nedd says.

Her son is supposed to start a summer program in July and preschool in the fall, but her heart races just thinking about it. The ravages of the coronavirus are all around her at the epicenter of the New York outbreak. Children her son’s age don’t know how to socially distance.

“I don't care what opens up, if my gut feels like it isn’t safe, we will have to figure out a way to continue to make it work at home,” Nedd says.

In Boston, Yahaira Lopez, a 41-year-old mother of 10-year-old twins, one with ADHD, the other with autism, was recently laid off from her job on a mobile crisis team performing mental health risk assessments. She’s struggling to be a substitute teacher to her two fourth graders, run Autism Sprinter, her nonprofit that helps the families and caregivers of children who are on the spectrum, and figure out how she’ll afford rent and utilities.

Schools are closed, summer programs are up in the air and Massachusetts has not yet reopened child care centers, she says. Even when these programs restart, Lopez says she’s not sure she will send her kids. Both of her sons have severe asthma.

“I would probably be very scared to send my children to any form of child care or after school program,” she says, “or, to be honest with you, even back to school into what may be overcrowded classrooms.”",real

Sales are booming at many bike shops around the country, as people stuck at home try something new for exercise and essential workers adapt to scaled-down public transit.

It's an especially opportune time for those who might otherwise be nervous about sharing the streets with cars — mayors across the country have closed streets to encourage cyclists and joggers to exercise.

""Stores are doing really well, and store owners who I've spoken to over the past couple months are almost sheepish in admitting that because they understand it's a pandemic,"" says Morgan Lommele, director of state and local policy at the industry coalition group People for Bikes.

In the majority of states that issued stay-at-home orders, bike shops were deemed essential businesses that could stay open, according to tracking by the League of American Bicyclists.

Bike sales in March were up by 50% over last year, the market research firm The NPD Group found. Including stationary exercise bikes, sales grew by 31% in the first quarter of the year over the same time last year.

""We're seeing families, individuals riding bikes in droves, more than we've seen over the last 20 years,"" said Lommele in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered.

Many retailers are running low on bikes, which often have to be ordered from manufacturers far in advance. ""There was no way to really predict this back in December and January,"" Lommele says.

The best-selling bikes have been in the $600 to $1,500 range, she says, which is the bulk of the market.

The pandemic has also forced new stresses onto bike shop employees, who must now contend with social distancing and cleanliness guidelines in a hands-on business.

And a large part of any bike shop's operations are not just sales, but service. When someone who hasn't ridden in years dusts off the old Schwinn for a socially distanced ride, it will need a tuneup.

But many shops have closed voluntarily or sent employees home. As of a month ago, an estimated 20-30% of shops were closed, according to Bicycle Retailer and Industry News.

That means more demand for repairs at the shops that stayed open. Independent bike shops saw repairs go up by 20%, The NPD Group found.

""There's this environment where, sure, shops are seeing record-level sales, record-level demand for service, but their employees are either staying at home or on restricted schedules,"" Lommele says.

Retailers and manufacturers are talking about a ""mini bike boom."" It's a shift from the focus of the last couple years — tariffs.

The vast majority of bicycles and parts in the U.S. come from China. But the Trump administration, in various rounds of tariffs, put many bicycle parts under tariffs of 25% above normal rates.

Many bike products have since been granted exclusions to tariffs, but the exclusions are set to expire in August and September.

""The industry is generally worried that if those exclusions expire, those additional tariffs will be put back on those products,"" Lommele says. ""And that will really harm our ability to provide a safe, low-cost product to Americans who want to ride bikes.""",real

Trump played at his Trump National Golf Club located in nearby Potomac Falls in Sterling, Loudoun County, Virginia.

Trump’s outing for fresh air, sunshine, exercise and camaraderie comes as the nation has turned the corner from the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus pandemic and is slowly returning to normalcy (in red states)–but with abundant precautions as the pandemic, which has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is expected to persist for months or years until a vaccine or herd immunity is achieved.

Keeper of presidential statistics Mark Knoller of CBS counted this to be Trump’s 185th golf outing as president.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Few things would please the world’s big automakers more than customers quickly returning to dealers’ lots to buy new cars once pandemic-induced lockdowns are lifted. What would top that is if many were to drive away in the battery-powered cars manufacturers have devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to develop. It may take state aid to tip the balance in electric vehicles’ favour.

Automakers’ outlook is brutal. Assuming factories reopen in full in the second half of 2020, global vehicle production would still decline by 21% from last year, IHS Markit predicts, the worst contraction since the financial crisis. Reflecting such pain, the Refinitiv Global Automobiles & Auto Parts index has fallen by nearly one quarter.

Still, the importance of Ford Motor and General Motors in the United States, Germany’s Daimler and Volkswagen and China’s Dongfeng Motor to their respective country’s economy should put automakers at the centre of any post-virus stimulus plans. And the International Monetary Fund has called for governments to pursue a green economic recovery.

These environmental and economic issues converge around electric vehicles, which by rights should become more appealing to drivers now. Air pollution, after all, might worsen the disease, adding to the concerns about climate change that first fuelled their adoption. Shares in Elon Musk’s Tesla, which accounted for around a fifth of global electric vehicle sales last year, have nearly doubled in 2020, signalling that carmakers should flog more than the roughly 2% of total auto sales the segment accounted for in 2019.

But battery-powered cars are in general more expensive, even though the affordability gap to vehicles running on fossil fuel has halved over the past five years. Jefferies analysts reckon the recent oil-price crash has widened gas guzzlers’ advantage to some $8,000 over the average ownership period. That’s a big hurdle when joblessness has skyrocketed.

Governments can help by, say, rehashing for electric vehicles the popular cash-for-clunkers programmes rolled out after 2009 in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Tripling the number of electric cars sold last year to 6.5 million with a $6,500 subsidy per vehicle, roughly the upper limit of what Germany currently offers, according to Deutsche Bank, would cost some $42 billion, or less than 1% of the combined 2019 GDP of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.

Pricey, yes, but hardly prohibitive. Faced with widespread economic devastation, states can afford to accelerate towards a lower-carbon future.",real

German Chancellor Angela Merkel broke with her country’s longstanding opposition to raising money together with other - often poorer - EU countries. But the proposal made with French President Emmanuel Macron is limited in scale and duration, which could help her sell it to skeptics back home.

It consists of 500 billion euros ($550 billion) in loans and grants to help countries through the recession, and is viewed by some as a step toward stronger EU ties as the 27-country union faces challenges not just from the virus crisis, but from populist forces in member countries Hungary and Poland who want to loosen the bloc’s ties.

France, whose president had pushed hard for the fund proposal announced Monday, exulted. “It’s a historic breakthrough,” said Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday. “We will be able to support the economic recovery in the countries most hit by the virus.”

“The second consequence is political: France and Germany affirm loud and clear their determination to see solidarity among European Union members placed at the heart of the European construction,” he said, calling it “a historical step for the whole European Union.”

Macron and Merkel suggested that the fund would send money starting in 2021 to the areas hardest hit by the virus outbreak and target sectors that are priorities for EU economic policy such as digitalization and fighting climate change.

The fund would be a one-off part of the EU’s budget and take advantage of EU institutions’ ability to borrow at extremely low interest rates for long periods. It adds to a 540 billion-euro package agreed among finance ministers from the 19 EU countries that use the euro. That included loans from the eurozone bailout fund that would have to be repaid.

The proposal remains a proposal, and key elements such as joint borrowing have been resisted by northern European countries such as Austria, Finland and the Netherlands. Until Monday, opponents also tended to include Germany, although Merkel had kept her comments vague on exactly how the recovery fund was to be funded.

The fund touches on broad issues of European integration and underlines the union’s lack of a central financial authority like those that exist at the national level. Germany, which has run a string of budget surpluses in recent years, has long resisted anything that smacks of its taxpayers being on the hook for the spending in less fiscally solid countries such as Italy.

The EU countries already borrow together in a limited way through their development bank and bailout fund, but that money is for loans, not given as grants. The EU already spends money on economic development projects in member states through a budget that amounts to about 1% of GDP, leaving the vast bulk of government spending at the national level.

It is not clear how the northern European opposition would be reconciled, or how the French-German proposals would be incorporated into the recovery plan being developed by the European Union’s executive Commission and due to be sketched out May 27. A commission spokesman said Thursday its proposal would include both grants and loans.

Nonetheless, as the two biggest countries in the EU, Germany and France are regarded as the chief political motor in the EU when they decide to work together.

Opponents of shared debt remained subdued on Tuesday. Finland’s finance ministry said it needed to study the proposal. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that “our position remains unchanged,” saying he had discussed the matter with Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Since the proposal is for a one-time fund during a crisis, it would represent incremental change. But some were seeing it as potentially the harbinger of more EU central spending.

“Crucially, these funds would be passed on to member states as grants rather than loans and according to need, implying a fiscal transfer between countries,” wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economic in an email. “But there is a lot of opposition to such a change, not least within Germany itself, so that is far from certain. And in the meantime, fiscal transfers will be small compared to the cost of the virus.”

Reluctance by Germany and other countries to sharing the burden of the economic recovery from the pandemic - which was no European country’s fault - provoked angry responses in heavily indebted Italy. Economists have expressed concern that Italy will come out of the crisis with even more debt and could face a financial crisis that would destabilize the wider region.

“Whether the recovery fund – if and when it is finally agreed – will help to dispel this impression and thus curtail the tail risk that a disaffected Italy may turn more euro-sceptic over time remains to be seen,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at private bank Berenberg. “But egged on by France, Germany is now taking the political risks sufficiently serious.’

Dmitry Peskov, official spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was hospitalized with confirmed Covid-19 infection on May 12, has developed bilateral pneumonia. In an interview with the Kommersant publication, Peskov said employees of the presidential administration get tested for the coronavirus infection on a daily basis.

""I had a feeling that I keep it under control. Then, unfortunately, one of my colleagues, with whom I earlier spoke, fell ill and I had to go into self-isolation mode after May 1,” the Kremlin representative said.

Peskov continued getting tested, and one of the tests was confirmed positive. According to Peskov, he had no symptoms on the first day, but then ""unpleasant"" body temperature rose to over 37 degrees and he developed bodily pains.

Peskov’s wife, former Olympic champion in figure skating Tatyana Navka, had the same symptoms, but her body temperature was “higher”. For a couple of days the spouses stayed home, but when they realized that the process “was going uphill, so to speak,"" they went to the hospital for CT scanning procedure.

Peskov noted that it is important to catch the moment. ""The main thing about this disease is not to miss it. This is an absolutely bloodthirsty virus. Although, thank God, doctors already have experience in combating it, but still the share of unpredictability associated with individual peculiarities is always present,"" he stated.

The peculiarity of COVID-19, according to Peskov, is that it is not the virus that starts “eating” the lungs, but the body itself. ""That is, a hormonal storm begins, and the immune system tries to defeat this virus. Together with the virus, the body starts to devour the lungs. This is where the frosted glass effect comes from. This may lead to pulmonary thrombosis. Well, it depends,” Dmitry Peskov said.

Bloodthirsty virus to live with forever

Answering a question about contacts with the president, Peskov noted that he had not contacted Putin in person for more than a month. ""There is no need for that, as my work is arranged differently,"" he explained, adding that video conferencing can take place both in open and closed mode, while modern technologies make it possible to ensure secrecy.

Peskov also said that his family took all precautions and stayed home for 1.5 months carefully, although they failed to avoid the infection.

“The virus is very dangerous indeed, it is easily transmitted from person to person easily, and it is very difficult to have guaranteed protection from it. The only way, and this should be understood by those who have underlying conditions in the form of chronic diseases, who belong to the older age group, - one has to stay home, avoid contact with the outside world,"" Putin’s spokesman said.

According to Peskov, mankind will always have to live with various coronaviruses: ""These are living organisms, they are fighting for a place for life on Earth."" Now one needs to wait for the vaccine, which experts, according to Peskov, inject themselves during clinical trials. ""We will not name the institution, the people, but those people who are die-hard fans of their work in the best sense of the word,"" he said.",fake

Many of the aid agencies operating in Yemen say the country is “really on the brink now,” Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a Friday briefing in Geneva.

“The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed,” he said, quoting the aid agencies working in the war-torn state.

Laerke went on to say that aid workers have to turn people away because they say they do not have enough medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment.

His comments came shortly after Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym as MSF, said its main COVID-19 treatment center in southern Yemen has recorded at least 68 deaths in just two weeks.

“What we are seeing in our treatment center is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in (Aden),” MSF’s operations manager for Yemen Caroline Seguin said Thursday.

The COVID-19 disease has further deteriorated the humanitarian situation in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population are reliant on international aid for survival.

Early this week, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that Yemen’s health system was already under heavy stress and would now be overwhelmed “if COVID-19 continues to spread.”

The so-called regime led by Yemen's former President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi in Aden has since April 10 announced 180 infections and 30 deaths from the coronavirus.

But the MSF said Thursday that its center in Aden had admitted 173 patients from April 30 to May 17, at least 68 of whom had lost their lives, suggesting “a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city.”

Since March 2015, Yemen has been heavily invaded by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, trying to restore power to Hadi.

Going to the beach is one of the highlights of summer, but coronavirus lockdowns have put that in jeopardy. Italian designer Umberto Menasci proposed a solution: ""Safebeach,"" a set of plexiglass boxes that divide the beach up and force social distancing.

423,642,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/6/21249831/chicago-community-organizers-demand-educational-reform-for-students-of-color,2020-05-06,Chicago community organizers demand educational reform for students of color,"A group of black parents and community activists called on city and schools officials Wednesday to work harder to address the needs of students of color during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Members of several local groups gathered to share their concerns outside Dyett High School in Washington Park, the site of a 2015 hunger strike to protest the closure of the later reopened neighborhood school.

The coalition listed off its demands on grading, standardized testing, supports for homeless students, counseling services and other issues they saw as central to a quality education for students from low-income families.

Chicago Public Schools officials have already started to address at least some of the concerns. Standardized tests are canceled for this school year, and the district has handed out more than nine million meals since schools closed almost two months ago.

CPS has also passed out 102,000 laptops and tablets, reaching all but 13,000 kids who need them, and hopes to distribute the rest in the next two weeks.

But Alberta Reid, a CPS mother of two, said there needs to be permanent change, and there hasn’t been enough of a coordinated effort to address students’ unique challenges, such as what to do when a student has a laptop but no WiFi.

“Many of our families do not have access to internet,” Reid said. “This has made regular participation online difficult and impossible.”

The district also was distributing 12,000 hotspots with free internet access to students without permanent homes, but devices haven’t been available to other students because of a supply shortage.

CPS spokeswoman Emily Bolton said the district’s “number one priority is to support our families, students and staff during this unprecedented time and we are doing everything in our power to serve families to the best of our ability.”

The coalition of organizers demanded CPS hire more school counselors and special education teachers, become a “restorative justice district” that eliminates punitive police-involved discipline at schools and re-purpose permanently closed schools as housing and resource centers. They also want more teacher and student input on the plan for returning to school when it’s safe, and revised, no-fa grading policy that would see all students start at a 75% grade and move up with completed work.

Jitu Brown, a longtime South Side community organizer, said he’s seen black and brown students neglected for decades. That has continued during the pandemic, he says, with a “lack of preparation” by CPS to fully serve students’ learning needs and “no communication or engagement with the public around how schools should look when school reopens.”

“We cannot go back to the way it was,” Brown said. “We have to confront education equity as a real issue in the city of Chicago and a commitment, not just a soundbite, a commitment to transforming how education is delivered in this city.

“Mayor Lightfoot, we ask you not to take this personally. We ask you to take this as an urging to be different. Take this as an urging to not be the Chicago Machine, but to truly walk the progressive walk, not just talk the progressive talk.”

Rev. Robin Hood, a West Side activist, said officials should use this time to reimagine education, not only now, but in the future.

“Now is the time to change this,” Hood said. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, which most of our communities have been in a pandemic for the last 50 years when it came to violence. We’ve been in a pandemic when it came to education.”",real

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.

So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.

“For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”

Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

That’s how her project, “Stories from Six Feet,” came to be.

“Stories from Six Feet” is a photo series that documents the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting Chicago through the eyes of its residents in isolation. The project lives on Instagram under the handle @StoriesFromSixFeet.

Treimer has captured photos of over 100 individuals, couples and families all over the city. Each image is captioned with the subjects’ names, neighborhood and a paragraph about how they’re holding up.

Treimer said she hopes the photo series will encourage people to maintain the CDC’s recommendation for social distancing without sacrificing connection with other people.

Helena Kim and her partner live in a loft apartment on the top floor of a building in West Loop. When they agreed to have their photos taken by Treimer, they weren’t sure how she’d manage it without coming inside. To their surprise, Treimer showed up with a drone.

“She was just down there with her drone and her remote control and her car, and we were just kind of shouting back and forth, like, ‘Hey!’” Kim said. “I know some of my other neighbors kind of came out just to check what was going on.”

Treimer has taken photos of people in all different kinds of quarantine situations, from studios to high-rise buildings to single-family homes.

Sameka Gates, a seventh grade teacher and mom of two, was introduced to Treimer’s work by a friend at church. When she got her pictures back, she started crying.

“Even though right now everything is uncertain and we’re in a space where there’s a lot of hurt and pain, there is some time where people are just happy,” she said.

Quarantining together isn’t always easy. In addition to teaching her seventh grade students, Gates is homeschooling her kids due to school closures — forcing her to learn what they need to learn, too.

“I’m up early in the morning and go to bed really late; it’s busy, busy, busy,” she said.

Gates isn’t the only person who has opened up to Treimer about the struggles of keeping it together while stuck at home. Many of her subjects have shared their struggles with mental health amid the isolation.

“It’s kind of amazing just to see how open and vulnerable people are being with a complete stranger,” Treimer said.

The stories shared in tandem with each photo are central to the project’s mission.

“When you put a photo and a story together, it feels very personal,” Kim said. “It feels very much like, ‘Wow, this could have happened to my neighbor, or this could be anyone.’ It gives emotion to the photos and just kind of ties it all together to paint the bigger picture of what’s really happening.”

Treimer said she hopes to document the stories of at least one person in every neighborhood in Chicago before Gov. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order is lifted.

Some day, those photos and captions may be used to help tell the city’s story of surviving the COVID-19 pandemic. Treimer hopes the story’s message is clear.

“I want people to know that at one point in their lives, we were all unified by this,” Treimer said. “We were all together in something, and we all knew, together, that we were going to get through it.”",real

And apparently the rule doesn't only apply to humans — an asteroid speeding toward Earth appears to know about the pandemic and is sporting a face mask of its own.

An asteroid called 52768 (1998 OR2) will zoom past Earth next week. Astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico are tracking the asteroid, and couldn't help but notice a familiar silhouette after capturing a new radar view of the object.

""The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,"" research scientist Anne Virkki said in a press release Thursday. ""But since we are all thinking about COVID-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.""

A team at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico took this range-Doppler radar image of Asteroid 1998OR2 on April 17. University of Florida

But don't worry — the asteroid has no chance of becoming infected with the virus.

Arecibo data confirmed that 1998 OR2 is about 1.2 miles across and rotates approximately once every four hours. Scientists at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies said it will make its closest approach to Earth on April 29, but it will still be 16 times farther away than the moon — nearly four million miles.

1998 OR2 is classified as a Potentially Hazardous Object, which are larger than 500 feet and come within 5 million miles of Earth's orbit. After its discovery, NASA said it is ""large enough to cause global effects"" if it impacted Earth, but poses no threat to the planet.

And it won't be the only time the asteroid pays Earth a visit. And next time, it'll come a little closer.

""The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,"" says Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory. ""In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.""

Arecibo said that scientists continue to monitor asteroids for planetary defense purposes, but are following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing masks while making observations.",real
449,588,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/business/coronavirus-china-vaccine.html,2020-05-04,China’s Coronavirus Vaccine Drive Empowers a Troubled Industry,"
China wants to beat the world in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine — and, by some measures, it is doing just that.
Desperate to protect its people and to deflect growing international criticism of how it handled the outbreak, it has slashed red tape and offered resources to drug companies. Four Chinese companies have started testing their vaccine candidates on humans, more than the United States and Britain combined.
But China’s leaders have empowered a vaccine industry that has long been mired in quality problems and scandals. Just two years ago, Chinese parents erupted in fury after they discovered ineffective vaccines had been given mostly to babies.
Finding a vaccine isn’t enough. China’s companies must also win over the trust of the public, who might be more inclined to choose a foreign-made vaccine over a Chinese one.
“The Chinese now do not have confidence in the vaccines produced in China,” said Ray Yip, the former head of the Gates Foundation in China. “That’s probably going to be the biggest headache. If they didn’t have all those incidents, people will probably line up by the miles to get it.”
The need is urgent. More than 247,000 people have died globally, by official figures as of Monday, and the true count is probably much higher. The coronavirus remains stubbornly difficult to stamp out — even China, which officially appears to have tamed the spread, has suffered from sporadic outbreaks.
China also wants to deflect accusations that its silencing of early warnings contributed to the global pandemic. Developing a vaccine for the world would, in addition, burnish its standing as a global scientific and medical power.
So China has made its vaccine a national priority, though it hasn’t disclosed spending details. One senior official said a vaccine for emergency use could be ready by September. State media has made a celebrity out of Chen Wei, the Chinese military’s top virologist, who is leading one of the vaccine efforts. The public is responding.
Huang Shiyue, an 18-year-old first-year medical student in Wuhan, left her apartment on a recent early Sunday morning for the first time in three months to take a taxi to a wellness center an hour away. There, she offered up her arm in the name of science.
But in an illustration of how difficult it will be to find a safe and effective treatment, Ms. Huang grew dizzy and sick.
“If I can help and benefit people with one little move,” she said, “then I think this is a very worthwhile thing.”
China’s vaccine drive has put Beijing’s considerable strengths and glaring weaknesses on display. With its firm hand on the levers of Chinese industry, Beijing can corral companies and scientists to reach national goals.
At the same time, China’s vaccine companies have been accustomed to a closed political system that has a history of covering up safety scandals and protects them from foreign competition. Few invest heavily in research and development, and they have not discovered many products with global impact.
Instead, many invest more in selling and distribution, a large chunk of which includes managing relationships with local disease control centers. Experts say that creates incentives for corruption.
China’s regulators also tend to look the other way when it comes to state-owned firms, which make up about 40 percent of the vaccine industry. Many vaccine makers operate with an expectation of impunity, knowing that even if they are found to have produced faulty products, they are unlikely to be shut down.
The vaccine that Ms. Huang received is being developed by CanSino Biologics, a Tianjin-based pharmaceutical firm, and the medical science arm of the People’s Liberation Army. The CanSino vaccine was the first to enter Phase 2 trials, which in the hierarchy of drug testing means it is further along than the world’s other candidates, though there is no guarantee that it will be proven effective. (It has been tested so far on 508 people; a candidate from Oxford University in Phase 1 trials, or earlier-stage testing, has been administered to twice as many people.)
One other Chinese institution also has a candidate in Phase 2 testing — the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an arm of state-run Sinopharm Group. Sinovac Biotech, a private company and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, which also belongs to Sinopharm, have potential vaccines in Phase 1 trials.
The Wuhan institute was involved in a 2018 scandal in which defective vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and other conditions were injected into hundreds of thousands of babies. China imposed a $1.3 billion fine on another virus maker involved, Changchun Changsheng. The scandal led to the firing of dozens of officials and pledges of a swift industry cleanup.
The government confiscated the Wuhan institute’s “illegal income,” fined the company and punished nine executives.
The Wuhan institute has been sued at least twice in China by plaintiffs who have alleged that the institute’s vaccines have caused “abnormal reactions,” according to court documents. In both cases, the court ruled that the Wuhan institute had to partially compensate the victims a total of roughly $71,500. Its executives have been accused at least three times of bribing officials at local centers for disease and control in various provinces to thank them for purchasing their vaccines. The executives were convicted but no criminal charges were pursued against the company.
Sinovac Biotech had also been involved in a bribery scandal, according to court documents. From 2002 to 2014, a court in Beijing said, the general manager of Sinovac Biotech gave China’s deputy director in charge of drug evaluations nearly $50,000 to help the firm with drug approvals. Sinovac was not charged. The general manager was a man surnamed Yin, the documents showed. Chinese media reports have said that person is the current chief executive, Yin Weidong, who held the title of general manager from 2001 to 2017.
Sinovac, the Wuhan institute, and its parent, China National Biotec Group, did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite the companies’ earlier stumbles, the Chinese government has given them permission to accelerate trials. Regulators in the United States and other places have done the same for other companies. The Wuhan institute, Sinovac and the Beijing institute got combined approvals to run the first two phases, a decision questioned by several Chinese scientists, who felt that safety results from the first phase should be evaluated before the second phase was begun.
Ding Sheng, the dean of the pharmacy school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that some companies were “adopting unconventional methods” in the preclinical research stage, running tasks like the design process and animal modeling at the same time when they should be done consecutively, according to the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper.
“I understand the people’s eager anticipation of a vaccine,” Dr. Ding was quoted as saying. “But from a scientific point of view, no matter how anxious we are, we cannot lower our standards.” He did not respond to a request for comment.
Dr. Chen’s academy issued calls on the internet for phase one volunteers. Ms. Huang successfully registered for the second round on April 10. The next day, she got a call and text message: Please come tomorrow.
“Of course, I was worried at the beginning,” she said. “To say you’re not at all worried is impossible, right?” She surfed the internet and called her teacher, who listed pros and cons. She sought advice from her parents.
Then she went. Workers ran an antibody test, to make sure she was not already immune to the coronavirus, an H.I.V. test and a pregnancy test.
The participants were divided into low- and medium-dose groups and another placebo group, as part of a “double-blind” experiment. They were not told their group.
Fifteen minutes after Ms. Huang got her shot, she started to feel dizzy. Her stomach hurt. Her heart began beating fast. She got diarrhea.
Dr. Chen and other doctors checked her. Someone offered her hot water. She took a walk in the sun. Finally, they took her in an ambulance to a subway station, where she took a taxi home.
Ms. Huang said she feels fine at home.Shi Zibo, a junior in college, also signed up to be a volunteer and got the shot on April 12. On the fourth day, he got a slight fever but said he has no other side effects.
“I felt very proud when I received the call,” Mr. Shi said. “There are not many opportunities for me in to contribute to other people in this life, so I will not regret it, regardless of the final result.”Amber Wang and Liu Yi contributed research in Beijing.",real
458,837,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/who_has_it_worse_donald_trump_or_abraham_lincoln.html,2020-05-13,Who Has It Worse: Donald Trump or Abraham Lincoln?,"President Trump's recent decision to leave the White House for a town hall at the knee of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial revived once again a reminder that President Lincoln seemed to be as hated in his day as President Trump is today. Some would say President Lincoln was reviled even more than President Trump since Lincoln was blamed for the Civil War in which about 600,000 to 700,000 American soldiers died (compared to a projected 100,000 American citizens due to the coronavirus), whereas President Trump is merely blamed — whether fairly or not — for the manner of the fight against the coronavirus — against an enemy opposed by Democrats and Republicans alike.

Actually, some say President Lincoln was hated even more than President Trump, since President Lincoln made the ultimate sacrifice — he was assassinated — while President Trump merely suffers from character assassination — again, whether justified or not, and whether a president's character is as important as his actions or not. To date, there is no shortage of gruesome incitement against President Trump, but it has been limited to words and drawings.

Notwithstanding all of the above, an argument can be made that the blind hatred of President Trump, which has been diagnosed as Trump Derangement Syndrome, is even more invidious than the widespread hatred against President Lincoln in his day. This is so because the people who hated President Lincoln at least had rational reasons to do so — that many believed he was responsible for putting an end to their privileged way of life, on the backs of their slaves (inhumane, but rational from the point of view of the Southern slave-owners), and many believed that President Lincoln not only caused the Civil War, but also prolonged the Civil War because of some of the military decisions he made (again, possibly wrong but rational according to many military experts), thereby causing so many extra people to die.

The people who blame President Trump for the deaths caused by the coronavirus are more invidious because they base this on false and irrational premises.

President Trump's critics say he did too little too late, even though most of the top scientific experts and Democratic politicians who criticize him continued to underestimate the severity and virulence of the virus long after President Trump put at least a partial ban on travel from China to the United States.

President Trump's critics point out that the travel ban wasn't total even though it was imposed sooner than bans by most European countries.

President trump's critics criticized even the partial ban as racist and xenophobic and by and large have not apologized.

President Trump's failure to do more sooner to fight the virus was due at least in part to his having been misled by the same scientists, experts, and politicians who in hindsight turned around and accused President Trump of doing too little too late.

Sweden's decision not to impose mandatory lockdowns at all resulted in lower death rates than five major European countries.

Studies have shown that the cutbacks to the economies of countries throughout the world due to their lockdowns are leading to more deaths worldwide as a result of hunger than the deaths caused by the coronavirus,

This is on top of the deaths caused by suicides due to the economic effects of the lockdowns and deaths caused by failures to be able to seek treatment for non-COVID illnesses.

The president has not imposed his own guidelines on when to reopen, but (a) he deferred to the scientific task force to create guidelines; (b) he left it to the governors to decide how to apply these guidelines, and to which counties, and (c) he even criticized governors — including Republicans — who reopened their economies without meeting the requirements of the guidelines.

The president has shown more sympathy for the 30+ million Americans who have lost their livelihoods (multiplied by the number of members of each such taxpayer's household) than most of the governors who have focused on ONLY the numbers of people who have succumbed to the illness, a ratio of 300+ to 1.

The president is blamed for not sending enough ventilators to local governments, notably those controlled by Democrats in New York and other jurisdictions, that failed to replenish their supplies during health emergencies that used them up during the Obama administration.

All of these factors build on the fact that Trump Derangement Syndrome is based on lies fed TO an unsuspecting public by politicians and members of the media who certainly know better.

It is absurd to call President Trump a xenophobe, considering he is a son of immigrants, and he married two immigrants, including his current wife.

It is absurd to call him anti-Muslim for banning immigrants from countries that included non-Muslim countries and that excluded the most populous Muslim country on the planet.

It is absurd to call him a misogynist, considering the many women he has consistently hired to important positions in his businesses and to represent him to the press and to the United Nations.

It is absurd to call him anti-veteran, considering his build-up of the military and his providing more medical options to veterans. (He never insulted Khizr Khan, but only asked rhetorically why his wife wasn't given an opportunity to speak, thus making a statement on behalf of women.)

It is absurd to call him anti-disabled based on some gestures he made at a press conference that he has been shown on video to have made whenever he insults people with whom he disagrees, including Senator Cruz when they were political rivals.

It is absurd to call him anti-black, considering how he lowered blacks' unemployment rate more than any other president in history prior to the coronavirus, not to mention his close personal friendships with many well known black American politicians and celebrities.

It is absurd to consider him anti-Semitic in light of the unprecedented support he has given the Israelis, not to mention his Jewish daughter and son-in-law who have unprecedented influence in his White House.

And it is absurd to condemn a president for colluding with a country even after a report compiled by his political enemies failed to find any evidence of such collusion, and to condemn a national security adviser who was pressured under false pretenses by anti-American Stalinist tactics into a false confession.

We live in a free country. People are free to criticize President Trump. President Trump is free to exaggerate and to speak imprecisely and in an unpresidential manner, especially if done to counterattack statements made by a hostile unfair, unimpressed, and unimpressive press. Members of the press, politicians, and actors are free to express their opposition to the president's views, character, and demeanor. But nobody has a right to knowingly distort the truth in doing so.

US job openings slumped on the last day of March as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic began to take hold.

Available positions fell to 6.2 million in March from 7 million in February, according to the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released by the Labor Department Friday. The median economist estimate was for a fall to 5.8 million, according to Bloomberg data.

""The JOLTS data for March only captured part of the coronavirus shock, but the numbers released this morning are still astounding,"" Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed, said in a Friday note.

He continued: ""Workers lost jobs at a horrifying rate. And back in March, the coronavirus shock was only being felt in the second half of the month.""

It's the latest report to show just how much the coronavirus pandemic and country-wide shutdowns to contain the disease have divested the US labor market. Since mid-March,36.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurancece, a Thursday report showed. Last week's April jobs report showed that the US economy erased 20.5 million payrolls during the month, and the unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.

The rate of hires also decreased in March to 5.2 million from nearly 5.9 million in February. Separations surged to 14.5 million, a series high, led by a spike in layoffs. The largest increase in layoffs was seen in the accommodation and food services industry, which had 4.14 million during the month.

Dispensaries are permitted to sell medical cannabis products on their property, as well as on adjacent sidewalks or curbs until March 30, according to new guidance from the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.

“Our top priority is to minimize the risk of and protect as many people as possible from exposure to COVID-19,” said Toi Hutchinson, Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s senior adviser for cannabis control. “These steps prioritize that critical objective, while also ensuring medical patients have access to the medicine they need.”

Patients in the state’s medical cannabis and opioid alternative programs and chosen caregivers will be able to purchase pot under the new guidance, while recreational customers will have to continue shopping inside.

Shops are also being advised to keep customers six feet apart by moving lines outside, closing cash registers and minimizing the time workers stand near customers. Employees should wear gloves while handling cash, frequently wash their hands and avoid asking patients to physically hand over their medical cards to be scanned, the IDFPR said.

Though pot deliveries are prohibited under state law, many stores have started encouraging customers to make orders online to expedite the shopping experience. Dispensaries that largely accept cash only will also be able to process transactions outside, allowing for curbside pick-ups.

Meanwhile, at least eight Illinois dispensaries have shut down adult-use sales to prioritize medical pot patients and others have limited the hours recreational users can shop. Among them are The Herbal Care Center on the Near West Side, MOCA Modern Cannabis in Logan Square and Dispensary 33 in Uptown.

”We understand that not everyone with a medical need has a medical card, but until further notice we can only serve medical patients,” Dispensary 33 posted on Twitter Monday.

Cresco Labs, the largest Illinois pot firm, will continue selling recreational cannabis at its four dual-use stores across the state, including at its store in Lake View.

“We feel that we need to continue to provide access for everyone that relies on cannabis for their daily well being, whether they’re a card carrying patient or not,” said Cresco spokesman Jason Erkes. “But we’ll obviously follow whatever state guidelines and mandates are put in place.”",real

Pritzker announce Arts for Illinois relief initiative,"Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday announced a new relief program to provide financial assistance to the city’s creative scene and cultural organizations impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Arts for Illinois Relief Fund, which has raised about $4 million from the public and private sector, is a partnership between the city and the state, along with the local philanthropic community.

Through the relief fund, the city’s creatives — stage and production members and part-time cultural workers — can apply for one-time grants of $1,500 distributed by 3Arts, an organization that supports artists of color, disabled artists and women artists. Grants will be awarded through a lottery system and will be disseminated quickly, according to the official announcement.

Nonprofit arts and cultural organizations of any size will be able to apply for relief through the Arts Work Fund. Based on financial need, organizations will be awarded grants from $6,000 to $30,000.

The Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) has contributed $1 million to the relief effort. Local charitable organizations such as the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Field Foundation and the Walder Foundation, have also made donations.

Fundraising efforts will be co-chaired by Illinois first lady M.K. Pritzker and Chicago first lady Amy Eshleman.

“Art has always been of incredible importance to me and to my family,” Pritzker said during his daily COVID-19 statewide press conference on Wednesday. “But of course so many of the usual ways of enjoying art together have had to be put on pause, and tragically, our creative communities have felt the financial hardship. [When] M.K., who has always put others front of mind in any hardship, told me that she had an idea to support art and artists in the fight against COVID-19, I was really excited to see what she would come up with. Honestly, she’s blown me away.”

The initiative has also launched artsforillinois.org, a website showcasing the work of Illinois creatives — artists, performers, singers, poets, painters and writers as well as dance and theater companies and museums — available for free viewing to the public.

“Artists live in relationship to their audience,” said DCASE commissioner Mark Kelly. “And for the audience to have disappeared in that visceral way of real life, it’s pretty shocking. And then on top of that, is just the economic devastation of lost jobs and lost income. In Chicago, without our music clubs, our theaters, our dance stages, without our films, poets, and painters, we’re not the great city that we live in every day.”

The financial impact of the pandemic on Illinois’ arts/creative community is staggering. According to survey by Arts Alliance Illinois, organizations closed under a statewide mandate are poised to lose more than $84 million in revenue; more than 24,124 individual events or performances have been canceled or postponed. A total of 3,563 full-time and 13,144 part-time/contract jobs have been impacted.

“This fund is so deeply appreciated,” said Amanda Williams, a Chicago-based visual artist who also spoke at Pritzker’s press conference on Wednesday. “To my fellow artists, I speak to you now. My hope is that this emergency fund can help you keep your lights on, or bridge you until the next cell phone bill is due, or to put food on your table. This is a crisis, and we understand the severity, but our hope is that this provides some light; some beacon of hope.”

Iraq's security forces said Wednesday they had nabbed Abdul Nasser Qardash, the man who allegedly replaced Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The self-styled first 'Caliph' of Daesh* (ISIS/ISIL) was reportedly killed as a result of a US raid on his hideout, where he supposedly blew himself up after being chased into a dead-end tunnel in northwestern Syria last October.

Although in 2017 Iraq declared that it had managed to eradicate the presence of Daesh in the country, recent months saw a surge in the terrorists' activity. Several days ago, the terrorist group, which became infamous for its public executions, beheadings, slavery, and torture techniques – had killed at least three people in two separate attacks in the country's eastern Diyala province. Authorities said two security officers had been killed and two others wounded amid clashes with the militants, who also kidnapped and murdered a civilian.

Using Every Opportunity

Ahmed Rushdi, senior foreign policy advisor to the Iraqi Parliament, says their 'resurgence' was triggered by the spread of the coronavirus, that had forced the authorities to consolidate all their efforts into the fight against the diseases that has already claimed the lives of more than 130 people.

""The country's security forces were sent into cities to supervise and manage the lockdown imposed on them by the government; and that gave Daesh the ability to manoeuvre.""

But the pandemic hasn't been the only factor that contributed to their comeback. Before the approval of the new government in the beginning of May, Iraq has been mired in a political crisis that led to the resignation of former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who has been accused by the masses of driving the country into an economic abyss.

The World Bank has already warned that Iraq's fiscal situation didn't show any signs of improvement, whereas the country's unemployment rate is expected to climb in 2020, reaching 8 percent, a 0.2 increase from the previous year.

In addition, Iraq has failed to tackle the growing problem of its one and a half million internally displaced persons and the amount of those living below the poverty line, with a United Nations report suggesting that by the end of the year the number of those who are in need of assistance would reach 40 percent.

Daesh, which has been observing the developments closely, knew to use Iraq's economic woes and its political turbulence to promote their own agenda, namely driving the Iraqi forces out and re-establishing control over the areas it had lost, said Rushdi.

""They are careful not to target Sunni areas. Quite the opposite is true: they come to Sunni-dominated neighbourhoods and promise to support and protect them from the Iraqi government's corruption and instability. While not many people are taken by their promises, a lot of people are frustrated at the government's inability to tackle the nation's economic problems.""

Similar tactics have been used by Daesh in the past, when the group capitalised on the frustration of the Sunni minority, with the government dominated by Shiites, prompting some to cooperate with the terrorists.

Divided We Stand?

Back then, it was the joint efforts of the US-led coalition, coupled with the assistance of Iran, the Iraqi army, the Kurdish Perhmarga and the country's Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) that eventually brought Daesh to its knees. Now, however, that might be a difficult target to reach.

""Unlike Daesh, our security forces are not that well trained. Nor do they have the necessary equipment to withstand the militants,"" explained Rushdi.

To make matters worse, the Iraqi security forces have also been largely divided, taking orders from different high-ranking officials within the Iraqi government. The army, for example, that boasts some 300 thousand military personnel, is answering to the Minister of Defence, whereas the Popular Mobilisation Units (PMUs) that comprise some 200 thousand members are reporting directly to the prime minister.

""The fact that the previous government has soured relations with the US hasn't helped us either,"" said Rushdi, referring to the demands made by the former PM calling on Washington to pull out its troops from the country, following the assassination of one of Iran's top military commanders, Qasem Soleimani, in early January.

""The result was that we have lost the assistance of the coalition as well as their air support and that inevitably led to losses on the ground,"" he explained.

That, however, is set to change, believes Rushdi. ""The new premier [Mustafa Al Kadhimi] is said to be supported by the US and chances are high that he will be able to appease the Americans and that will eventually help Iraq to curb the spread of Daesh"".

Former President Barack Obama criticized the federal government's coronavirus response in a thinly veiled swipe at the Trump administration during a virtual commencement address delivered to historically black colleges and universities on Saturday.

""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in his speech. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.""

These latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.

Back in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.

""I don't take responsibility at all,"" Trump said at a press briefing. ""Because we were given a — a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.""



One of Trump's own top health advisors, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissed the idea that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine during a Senate hearing this week.



The White House responded to Obama's speech with a statement defending Trump's coronavirus response, claiming it had ""saved lives."" At least 88,437 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 1.4 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Streamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.

""We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,"" Obama said during the speech. ""Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.""

Obama ended the speech on a note of optimism for the class of 2020, saying that the graduates were all ""role models"" now.

""Your participation in this democracy, your courage to stand up for what's right, your willingness to forge coalitions — these actions will speak volumes,"" he said.",real

State to offer drive-thru service to renew license plate stickers","Illinois drivers looking to renew their license plate registration stickers won’t have to leave the car, as the Illinois Secretary of State’s Office is planning to open up seven drive-thru operations “like we’re doing a hamburger and a shake.”

Those seven locations – three of them in Chicago — will open next week to provide only the vehicle registration renewal as a way to serve both the public and as a test run as Secretary of State Jesse White begins to slowly reopen the facilities.

“This is the first step in the process of reopening the office, and we thought this was a good way to go about it, that there really wouldn’t be much direct contact with people,” said Dave Druker, a spokesman for office. “The public would not be coming into a building. It would be a drive-thru, like we’re doing a hamburger and a shake.”

Drivers can access the drive-thru services beginning May 19.

The three Chicago Secretary of State facilities are Chicago North, 5401 N. Elston Ave.; Chicago South, 9901 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive; and Chicago West, 5301 W. Lexington. All three will be open Mondays and Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Tuesday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Drivers will not be allowed to pay in cash.

Drive-thru service will be offered at the facilities in Rockford, Macomb in western Illinois and Tilton in east-central Illinois on Tuesdays from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Wednesday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. to noon.

The Springfield-Dirksen location will be open on Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Motorists can still renew their registrations online, but the new drive-thru facilities will serve as an alternative. Secretary of State employees will be required to wear personal protective equipment, and drivers will be encouraged to wear face masks.

The state requires vehicles in the Chicago and Metro East areas to pass an emissions test before drivers can renew their registrations, but the testing sites are closed. So, with emissions tests sites and vehicle services shut down because of the pandemic, people who have expired vehicle registrations have 90 days after vehicle services fully open up again to renew which will likely be around June 1, Druker said.",real

The US Food and Drug Administration has ordered a Bill Gates-backed coronavirus testing program in Seattle to discontinue indefinitely, The New York Times first reported. The testing program, which offered at-home testing kits to Seattle-area residents under authorization from Washington state, was ordered to stop activities and wait for additional approval from the FDA.

SCAN, or the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, was testing 300 people a day before it was ordered by the FDA to stop testing, and applications were to be made public soon. In a May 12 blog post, Gates said that SCAN wasn't meant to replace widespread federal testing, but to ""paint a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is moving through the community, who is at greatest risk, and whether physical distancing measures are working.""

But, on May 14, SCAN's website posted an update saying the FDA required additional emergency use authorization (EUA) for self-collected coronavirus tests. The update specified that SCAN asked for EUA on April 13. ""There are no issues or concerns with the safety and accuracy of SCAN's test,"" the update said.

Instead, an FDA spokesperson told The Times, the issue seems to be with the categorization and use of SCAN's tests. The tests are categorized as surveillance tests, which can be used by researchers but cannot be given to patients or doctors for diagnostic purposes. Since SCAN was returning results to patients, the FDA said that the program needed to be subjected to guidelines for diagnostic testing.

SCAN was launched in early March with funding from the Gates Foundation, and was a collaboration between the Seattle and King County Public Health Department, the Brotman Baty Institute, the medicine faculty University of Washington, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and the Seattle Children's Hospital.

According to Gates' blog post, the testing program is an extension of an early flu research program he helped found in 2018, the Seattle Flu Study. The Seattle Flu Study, which previously tracked the spread of the flu during the 2018 season, detected the first coronavirus case in the United States in February.

Walz Refuses to Stop Killing Grandmas","Governor Walz is here to do two things during the coronavirus: shut down churches and kill grandmas.

""Hey Walz, how many grandmas did you kill today?""

And he won't stop. The mere fact that 81% of coronavirus deaths in Minnesota have occurred in nursing homes won't even slow his grandma-killing administration down. Anyone with a conscience would stop, good thing Walz is a real lefty.

Despite the devastating death toll, Minnesota nursing homes are still being allowed by state regulators to admit coronavirus patients who have been discharged from hospitals. Early in the pandemic, the Minnesota Department of Health turned to nursing homes and other long-term care facilities to relieve the burden on hospitals that were at risk of being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Minnesota hospitals have since discharged dozens of infected patients to nursing homes, including facilities that have undergone large and deadly outbreaks of the disease, state records show.

Hospitals were never overwhelmed. This lockdown fetish killed horrifying numbers of seniors instead.

urrently, even poorly rated nursing homes with large and deadly clusters of coronavirus cases have been allowed to admit COVID-19 patients from hospitals. One such facility, North Ridge Health and Rehab in New Hope, has accepted 42 patients from hospitals and other long-term care facilities since mid-April even as the coronavirus has raged through its 320-bed nursing home, killing 48 of its patients and infecting scores more. “It makes no sense to bring more COVID-19 patients into facilities that have already failed to protect them,” said Sen. Karin Housley, the Republican chairwoman of the Senate Family Care and Aging Committee. “If it were my mom or dad in one of these facilities, I would be really worried.”

Well she's a Republican. Democrats understand that killing senior citizens is a pathway to justify more lockdowns and get more votes.

State health officials and long-term care industry representatives have defended the practice of discharging some COVID-19 patients to nursing homes, saying it is part of a broader strategy to conserve critical hospital beds during the pandemic.

Gotta conserve those empty hospital beds for the patients you don't have and aren't allowed to treat, in order to kill seniors.

Statewide, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus has killed more than 600 Minnesotans at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. That is a staggering 81% of the deaths from the pandemic statewide.

Her video, which has since been reinstated, featured doctors discussing the media’s politicization of the drug and how that interferes with research into potential treatment or prevention against Covid-19.

Sharyl: Camps largely divided along political lines. Many right-leaning media figures sided with hydroxychloroquine while the left-leaning press backed remdesivir. Each accusing the other of ignoring real science. Dr. William O’Neill: I’ve never seen science politicized in 40 years of practice.

Several doctors have stepped forward to discuss the difficulty of attempting to study hydroxychloroquine in a hyperpolitical media climate.

“We’re hearing now from some participants that the study and the drugs feel too political, and they just don’t want to participate at all,” exclaimed Christine Johnston, a researcher at the University of Washington.

While researching the financial ties of several government experts in charge of drafting treatment guidelines for the virus, Attkisson found that nine of them had ties to Gilead, the manufacturer of remdesivir. Another 11 were reportedly linked to a drug company and seven, including two committee leaders had direct ties to Gilead, and two were even on Gilead’s advisory board.

Sharyl: All three scientists criticized that VA report casting doubt on hydroxychloroquine as little more than a list of cases with crucial details missing. It turns out one author of the report received research funding from Gilead, the maker of remdesivir, including a 247-thousand dollar grant in 2018. Orient: I think we have to look at the money. There’s no big profits made in hydroxychloroquine. It’s very cheap, easy to manufacture, been around for 70 years. It’s generic. Remdesivir is a new drug that could be very expensive and very lucrative if it’s ever approved. So, I think we really do have to consider there’s some financial interest involved here. [SOURCE]

YouTube has been notorious lately for censoring content which goes against the official stance of the World Health Organization (WHO) or other governmental authorities on the pandemic. Not only have famous interviews with David Icke been removed, followed by a subsequent ban from the platform, but an NBC press briefing with California doctors was taken down after receiving over 5 million views, and the film Plandemic featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits has been severely targeted.

Facebook has also been cracking down on coronavirus related content, as Sharyl highlights in an April Facebook post. Upon sharing a documentary from The Epoch Times, Facebook ‘fact-checkers’ claimed that Attkisson posted false content about the origin of the coronavirus, but the article used to ‘debunk’ her was written before the documentary had even aired.

“When self-appointed fact-checkers intervene to try to stop people from accessing certain information, or to bully and controversialize those who report and read facts that are off the narrative powerful interests are trying to forward, it should be concerning to all.” – Sharyl Attkisson

South Africa stopped all sales of alcohol when its lockdown came into effect on March 27 and the brewery has seen beer pile up at its production facilities. The brewer is seeking special permission from government to move the beer to other storage facilities. The transport of alcohol has also been outlawed in South Africa.

SAB told news station eNCA on Thursday that if it’s not able to move the beer, which amounts to about 130 million liters (34 million gallons), it’ll be forced to “discard” it at a loss of about $8 million. That loss would put 2,000 jobs at risk, SAB said.

It would also be frustrating news for millions of thirsty South African beer drinkers who are going without.

South Africa is one of just a handful of countries that have prohibited alcohol sales as part of its fight against the coronavirus. India and Thailand also had bans on alcohol sales, but recently lifted their restrictions. Panama and Sri Lanka still have bans in place.

The South African government has also banned the sales of cigarettes in the lockdown and has been criticized over its hard-line approach.

Prof. Salim Abdool Karim, one of the government’s top health advisers in the COVID-19 pandemic, defended the alcohol ban at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. He said alcohol is a significant contributing factor to violent crime and road accidents in South Africa and banning its sale has reduced pressure on medical services.

523,1803,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842,2020-05-22,Behind Trump’s demand to reopen churches: Slipping poll numbers and alarm inside his campaign,"“I did a number of briefings with donors and key stakeholders and said the longer this goes on, there’s going to be a perceptible and predictable float-down once you get past the initial rally-around-the-flag upswing,” said Ralph Reed, a top Trump surrogate and director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.

“Now you’re in this trough and what voters are going to do is they’re going to wait and render a verdict once they’ve assessed the job President Trump has done to bring the economy back into recovery coming out of the pandemic,” he added.

Following the PRRI survey, which was conducted while Trump was a dominant presence at televised daily briefings by his administration's coronavirus task force, Pew Research Center released new data last week that showed a 7-point increase from April to May in white Catholics who disapprove of Trump’s response to the Covid-19 crisis and a 6-point decline among white evangelicals who previously gave him positive marks.

Trump campaign aides, White House officials and outside allies are responding to the threat by boosting their outreach to religious voters and promising to prioritize religious gatherings as they push to reopen the U.S. economy. Administration officials have conducted multiple calls with conservative Christian groups to ensure their support over the past two months. Trump himself recently attended an online worship service hosted by St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York. And Vice President Mike Pence held a roundtable with faith leaders in Iowa earlier this month. Reed said his organization is planning a get-out-the-vote campaign three times as large as its effort in 2016.

The president’s reelection operation “will engage the Christian community nationwide to overwhelmingly reelect President Trump in 2020,” Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso said in a statement.

“In addition to his extraordinary record on conservative and faith-based issues, he has appointed well over 180 solid, conservative federal judges … defended religious freedoms and has stood as the most pro-life president we’ve ever had,” Farnaso added.

On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.

“The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”

Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)

“Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.

It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.

Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.

It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.

“If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”

Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.",real
525,592,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/scientists-conclude-it-unlikely-have-covid-19-twice/,2020-05-04,Scientists Conclude That It Is Unlikely To Have COVID-19 Twice,"According to South Korean scientists a number of reported cases of COVID-19 patients relapsing after overcoming the disease were due to faulty testing; researchers at the South Korean CDC now say that it is impossible for COVID-19 to reactivate in human bodies.

In South Korea there have been over 10,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 245 deaths, that is a 2.3% fatality rate which is lower than the 3.4% averaged as stated by W.H.O. In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.

The apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.

As a result of these reports W.H.O has warned against using “immunity passports” as a way of allowing people to return to work simply because they have antibodies for the virus in approaches for countries to begin to lift restrictions and lock downs in a targeted manner to resume economic activity. Such passports would be issued to those who have overcome COVI-19 infections and tested positive for antibodies for the virus based on the assumption of them being immune, but they rely on the accuracy of the testing.

In an update to this guidance WHO warned that there was ""no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"". It was also not expected that the PCR testing used to check for blood antigens for the actual particles of the virus itself would have issues.

The South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.

W.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.

""People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,"" the WHO warned. ""The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,"" its guidance added at the time, although this guidance is currently being kept under review.

Unlike other viruses like HIV and chickenpox that can break into the nucleus of human cells to stay latent for years before reactivating, COVID-19 stays outside of the host’s cell nucleus according to the South Korean CDC.

""This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,"" explained Dr Oh Myoung-dong, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion.

However, if the virus mutates further it could be possible that COVID-19 could infect people who had previously overcome it in the future, in a manner similar to that of the flu.",fake

Meanwhile USHG, owner of New York City's Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, will start offering takeout services at two of its counter-service restaurants.

""There is no interest or excitement on my part to having a half-full dining room while everyone is getting their temperature taken and wearing masks, for not much money,"" he said.

Medical experts expect the earliest a vaccine will be widely available is next January.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Danny Meyer, head of Union Square Hospitality Group, which owns New York City hotspots Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern, has said that some of his restaurants probably won't open until there's a coronavirus vaccine.

Most experts indicate that the earliest a vaccine would be widely available is January 2021.

Meyer didn't specify which of USHG's 18 New York City restaurants would keep its doors closed, but told Bloomberg that full-service restaurants like the Union Square Cafe would be difficult to make profitable in a restaurant at half capacity or less.

""There is no interest or excitement on my part to having a half-full dining room while everyone is getting their temperature taken and wearing masks, for not much money,"" he said.

USHG operates Gramercy Tavern, Cafes at Moma, and Union Square Cafe — Meyer's first restaurant, which he founded in 1985 at age 27. Meyer went on to found Shake Shack, which is not currently owned by USHG.

Still, USHG's counter-service restaurants, including Daily Provisions and Marta, could open for takeout service as early as next week, according to Eater New York.

Already, USHG has laid off 80% of its staff as revenue has nosedived on account of the coronavirus pandemic, as reported by Business Insider's Taylor Borden. The cuts and prolonged shuttering signal a significant weight on the restaurant industry that's not going away soon; The New York Times reported that US restaurants could suffer a $225 billion loss in the next three months alone.

Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines suggest reopening with strict social distancing measures, depending on recommendations from local authorities. And prominent NYC restaurateurs have expressed concerns on restricted openings to Mayor Bill de Blasio, which currently bar nonessential businesses from opening through June. New York guidelines set last week by Gov. Andrew Cuomo document seven requirements for reopening: a 14-day decline in deaths, a drop in hospitalizations, and sufficient testing and tracing.",real
536,127,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/collaboration-develop-covid-19-t-cell-therapy/,2020-03-23,Collaboration To Develop COVID-19 T-cell Therapy,"Baylor College of Medicine is teaming up with AlloVir to work on developing T-cell therapies against the COVID-19 outbreak; this collaboration will build on existing work to develop off the shelf cell therapies that can identify and eliminate specific viruses.

AlloVir has been investigating how to help those with weakened immune systems cope with viral pathogens, and have accumulated evidence of improvement in an approach that entails exposing donor T-cells to cytokines that are combined with viral fragments thereby equipping the immune cells to recognize and help eliminate certain pathogens. With the most advanced expression of this approach being Viralym-M T-cell Therapy which was designed to kill 6 viruses that commonly affect immunocompromised patients; the drug was moved into phase 2 in 2014 with enough data to encourage planning of a late phase program.

This same approach will be applied to SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with the goal to create an off the shelf therapy that is capable of targeting specific and similar viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as endemic coronaviruses. The plan is to position specific T-cells for use as monotherapy and incorporate the coronavirus into ALVR106, which is a preclinical asset geared towards community acquired respiratory viruses. Using this approach researchers hope to improve the outcomes for those who are immunocompromised and become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that could overwhelm their weakened immune systems.

A timeline has not been provided for this COVID-19 program, but the interest in coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 could mean that such therapies may still be relevant even if they miss the window of opportunity for these treatments for the pathogen currently at hand. Other companies that re-purpose existing drugs may have more advanced assets, but it is worth noting that T-cell therapy may help to fill in gaps within the treatment landscape.

“Given the worldwide coronavirus pandemic and risks to immunocompromised patients now and in the future, we believe it is our responsibility to leverage our scientific expertise and allocate resources for an allogeneic, off-the-shelf, coronavirus-specific T-cell program,” said Ann Leen, Ph.D., AlloVir Co-Founder, Chief Scientific Officer, and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. “Together with Baylor College of Medicine we have already advanced two highly innovative allogeneic, off-the-shelf, multi-virus specific T-cell investigational immunotherapies. We believe we can apply this same approach to develop a cell therapy to treat and prevent coronavirus infections and diseases in immunocompromised patients.”",fake

Here’s what the NFL should do.,"Football is the only major sport that hasn’t been interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and the NFL has basically plowed through its offseason, so there seems to be an assumption that it’ll be business as usual.

That type of thinking led the league office to prepare a standard 16-game schedule for the 2020 season — an audacious move considering all 32 team facilities are closed indefinitely. It comes out Thursday night, about a month later than it typically has, though the NFL said it had been considering moving the highly anticipated annual release to May anyway.

It’s as if the league refuses to concede in any way that the outbreak might derail it.

Odds are, it will.

The conversation around the coronavirus started with “weeks” before quickly shifting to months and now years. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday he can’t foresee gatherings of more than 50 people until the final phase of recovery, which won’t be this year. An NFL traveling party is triple that.

It’s fine to hope for the best, but the league needs to plan for the worst. A shortened season would undoubtedly result in some inequitable scheduling, so if the NFL were prudent, it would take that into account within the 16-game slate.

If football can’t start on time with a Thursday night opener Sept. 10, the league needs to establish priorities.

Every team’s six divisional games should be held the last six weeks of the season to provide the best chance of keeping those matchups intact. If it was only possible to play six games, those are the six that matter the most.

On the flip side, the cross-conference games should come first in the schedule. For the Bears, that means home games against the Texans and Colts and road games against the Jaguars and Titans.

The reasoning is clear: Intra-conference games are more important in determining playoff spots. And this will be the first season in which seven teams make the playoffs from each conference, by the way.

There has been speculation about the league leaving open the possibility of taking the first four games of the season and tacking them on the back end of the schedule — meaning they’d be played throughout January — if needed, but that seems unlikely. Taking the regular season through the end of January and having the playoffs in February would require the Super Bowl moving to March.

The Super Bowl is awarded three to five years in advance because of the massive amount of planning necessary to host it. It’s not so simple to bump it back a month. There’s a far greater likelihood of the NFL canceling the first four weeks than delaying the Super Bowl.

One element that would maintain fairness is to have every team alternate home and road games rather than have the occasional three-game homestand or back-to-back road games. That gives the NFL the best chance to have every team play the same number of home dates if it has to cancel games.

It’s rare to have this level of mystery going into an NFL schedule release. The Bears-centric drama generally revolves around when the Packers games are and how many prime-time slots the team gets.

It’s usually a bit anticlimactic because opponents are predetermined by the NFL scheduling model and have been known since December.

The Bears will play each opponent in the NFC North twice. They’ll also host the Saints, Giants, Buccaneers, Texans and Colts. They’ll travel to the Rams, Falcons, Titans, Jaguars and Panthers. That’s the plan, anyway.

But that’s not why everyone’s waiting for the schedule to drop. Pro football will become the first team sport in America with a plan to resume games. And that plan will be interesting, but it’ll also be hard to believe.",real

The platform normally takes 15 percent of each digital sale and 10 percent of each merchandise purchase. The lifted fees will be in place until 12AM PT tonight.

While streaming music does eventually pay out some money to artists, it can take months and is often divvied up between a lot of parties. Buying music on Bandcamp is a way to quickly and more directly put money in a musician’s pocket, as there are often fewer middlemen and funds are deposited within 24–48 hours of a purchase. Bandcamp’s structure is also unique in that it allows for flexible payments. Artists set a minimum purchase price for music and physical goods, but people are welcome to add more on top when they buy as a tip or gift.

Bandcamp is used by hundreds of thousands of artists, more than 3,000 labels, and has an inventory of over 800,000 unique physical products. The platform says that fans have paid artists $470 million through the platform since it launched in 2007, with $10.2 million paid out in the last 30 days.

“For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not,” says Bandcamp co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond. “Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come.”

The Verge noted this yesterday in speaking with musicians looking to Twitch to recoup lost tour funds. A study by the Music Industry Research Association found that the average US musician overwhelmingly relies on live shows for income, and now many are contending with unexpected hardship as many have scrapped most tours in recent weeks due to the pandemic. “The more you can prove you can sell hard tickets, the more you’re worth when you’re booked,” musician Marc Rebillet told The Verge. “I’m sort of scrambling to find a way to keep being able to live the way I want to live.”

For artists, Bandcamp’s announcement also outlines other ways to make money on the platform, including releasing old demos or live recordings, setting up a subscription service, and listing things like video hangouts, lessons, and gear tutorials as merch items.

“Sewage is a source of information on human health, and can really be transformed into a public health observatory,” says Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot, a startup that analyzes wastewater.

Wastewater-based disease monitoring is a relatively new strategy, but it’s already been able to predict potential outbreaks of illnesses before cases appear. In Israel, for example, officials found the poliovirus in the sewage system in 2013 and mounted a vaccination campaign in response. Research shows that the new coronavirus is found in feces, so it’s a good candidate for this approach.

In collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Biobot analyzed sewage samples taken in Massachusetts in the middle of March. Based on the amount of virus, it predicted that there were a few thousand people infected in the area. At the time, there were only just over 400 confirmed cases. Currently, there are almost 40,000.

Now, Biobot is analyzing samples from over 100 sewage treatment facilities in 30 states. Ghaeli told The Verge she hopes the data can give local communities a snapshot of their outbreak and help them determine when it’s safe to loosen distancing recommendations.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

What was the company focused on before the COVID-19 pandemic?

We asked as many government and public health officials as we could one question: what is your biggest public health concern? The answer was the opioid epidemic, really across the board here in North America. We focused our first product around that, which was, up until two months ago, one of the biggest public health concerns in the US. We launched our opioid product in late 2018, and from there, we had scaled to about seven communities to sample for opioid levels.

We looked for heroin, fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and a dozen specific prescription opioid drugs. But then we also were measuring methadone and Suboxone, which are substitution therapies, and Narcan, the overdose reversal drug, to understand their update in a community. If a community is opening a new methadone clinic, you would want to see methadone consumption increasing.

Why did you decide to jump in on COVID-19 surveillance?

When the scope of the coronavirus outbreak became clear both here in the US and globally, we knew that as a company we had to respond. That’s why we started Biobot. We started a partnership with a lab at MIT, together with other researchers at Harvard and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in order to actually develop the methods and the protocols to measure the virus in sewage.

What did you find when you started examining sewage samples for the coronavirus?

In late March, we published a paper outlining that work on samples collected in the Massachusetts area. We were able to successfully detect the virus and start quantifying the amount of virus that we were seeing. From there, we put forward an estimate of the number of individuals we think are infected with the virus and contrast that with the number of confirmed cases.

We then knew that this source of data would be extremely complementary to data on confirmed patients. Public health departments could use this information to refine their response and to understand the true scope and magnitude of the outbreak. It could also help them evaluate when and how to start scaling back quarantine-style policy policies and recommendations.

Public health experts have other tools to estimate the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a community, like antibody testing, which can hint at how many people have been sick. How does wastewater analysis fit in with those other techniques?

It’s important to look at different sources of data because each different source is painting a separate sort of vignette of the outbreak. We need all of these vignettes in order to actually manage this crisis as effectively as possible.

When it comes to sewage prevalence estimates, there are no privacy implications, and the data is not HIPAA protected. As a result, it can be shared a lot more effectively between response teams, which makes it important as a layer of data.

Another thing that we can think about with sewage data is, for example, why do we have these discrepancies where clinical cases are so low when this data from sewage saws that they should be high? One of the reasons is obviously that individual testing is limited, so not everybody who is sick has access to a test. Sewage testing could also be accounting for individuals who are asymptomatic or individuals with very mild symptoms. Those are people who aren’t even seeking out testing, but they’re still shedding the virus and they’re still using the toilet — so they come up in our samples.

COVID-19 is a problem all over the country, not just in Massachusetts. How are you expanding the program?

We launched a campaign soliciting wastewater samples from wastewater treatment facilities all over the US. This is pro bono. We’re just asking that the treatment facilities pay for the shipping cost for the samples. We’re collecting samples in over 100 locations across the US, representing about 30 states. Almost all the participants are sending weekly samples. The hope is this data is going to start showing where the outbreak is trending, and where we are in that curve.

What are you seeing in that data so far?

We’re generating data on an ongoing basis, and sharing it directly back with the wastewater facilities who have looped in local health departments and COVID response teams. Our data does more or less correlate with the clinical case rankings or hotspots across the US in the limited sites that we are testing.

Is Biobot going to keep tracking infectious disease even after the coronavirus outbreaks die down?

Even prior to the COVID outbreak, we knew we wanted to eventually work in infectious diseases as well as continuing with the opioid product. I think that’s what’s so great about this technology: we don’t need to choose one public health issue over another. We can actually look at data across multiple different public health priorities at once. It’s all contained in this same data source.",real
560,1022,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heroes-act-coronavirus-relief-house-vote-today-2020-05-15/,2020-05-15,House passes $3 trillion COVID-19 relief bill,"On Friday evening, the House passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill providing assistance to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline health care workers, student debt forgiveness and bolstered Medicaid and Medicare. The bill is known as the HEROES Act, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act.

The measure, over 1,800 pages long, is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Senate, although Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the Senate will pass further COVID-19 relief legislation. But he said he will work with the White House to determine what's needed and how soon.

McConnell has backed off an earlier statement that states should be allowed to go bankrupt, conceding that there will have to be another relief bill at some point. However, he said his red line is the inclusion of liability-protection provisions for businesses to keep them from being sued if workers or patrons are infected with COVID-19.

The House bill will now go the Senate, where Republican senators have already indicated the bill is dead on arrival.

Earlier Friday evening, the House also passed a measure to temporarily allow both remote voting by proxy and official remote committee proceedings during the coronavirus pandemic. The nearly party-line vote, 217 to 189, means that a member present at the Capitol would be able to cast a vote on behalf of up to 10 absent colleagues.

The pandemic has raised concerns about having lawmakers gather to vote, particularly since many members of Congress are older than 60 and therefore more vulnerable to serious illness caused by the virus.

House Republicans opposed the rule change, arguing that members of Congress are essential workers and should return to the Capitol.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said when she announced the legislation on Wednesday that the plan was ""necessary to address the corona crisis,"" arguing that the bill's priorities were ""opening our economy safely and soon, honoring our heroes, and then putting much needed money in the pockets of Americans.""

The House votes came as the unemployment rate rises to levels unseen since the Great Depression, with millions of Americans out of work or furloughed.

The bill includes provisions to assist farmers, protect renters and homeowners from evictions and foreclosures, and extend family and medical leave provisions previously approved by Congress. The legislation would also provide relief for essential workers, such as aviation, rail and Amtrak workers, as well as extend work visas for immigrants.

It faced opposition from Republicans and more moderate Democrats in the House because of its size, although progressives argue the legislation doesn't go far enough. Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, known for her progressive politics, told reporters Friday that she would not support the bill.

""I, unfortunately, will be voting no on the bill, and really, this was a difficult decision for me,"" Jayapal said, explaining that the bill did not do enough to ensure paycheck guarantees for struggling workers.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent progressive freshman in the House, told reporters that it was a ""tough bill.""

""I think we can go further, especially when it comes to healthcare,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, calling the bill a ""mixed bag.""

Meanwhile, Republicans argued that the bill was far too large. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, said on the House floor Friday that it was a ""dark day for our country."" Republican Congressman Tom Cole called the legislation ""massive and unwarranted.""

""I'm just mystified why my friends felt the need to inject a clearly partisan bill and think this is going to move us down the road in the right direction. It's not,"" Cole said on the House floor.

In his weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appealed to the 40 freshman Democrats who flipped Republican seats in 2018, urging them to vote against the bill.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously said it was time to hit ""pause"" on negotiating the next round of coronavirus legislation.

""The president and Senate Republicans are going to be in the same place,"" he said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. ""We will let you know when we think the time is right to begin to move again. I think there's a high likelihood we'll do another bill, and I've just indicated what we'll need to be a part of any bill that actually gets a presidential signature and is brought up and passed by a Republican majority in the Senate.""

Philippine police have detained a man for issuing an online death threat to President Rodrigo Duterte in what has become the latest in a series of such arrests over the past several weeks.

Shortly before the detention on Tuesday, the man, who was not identified, reportedly wrote on his Facebook page, “200 million [Philippine] pesos (8.7 million dollars) to anybody who kills Duterte; bring me his head here in my barangay [village]”.

The arrest was preceded by the police in the southern province of Cebu last week detaining 26-year-old Maria Ceron for ostensibly pledging 75 million pesos (1.4 million dollars) to anyone who would do a hit job on the Philippine president.

This followed National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents in the Dagupan district detaining a man who allegedly offered “rewards” of 50 million pesos (more than one million dollars) to “anyone who can kill Duterte” in a proposal that they reportedly shared on social media.

The suspect was identified as Ronnel Mas, 25, a teacher at a public school in the Zambales province.

The man, who reportedly deactivated his Twitter account after the post went viral, confessed to issuing the threat, but added that “neither did he have P50 million, nor does he want to have the president killed”.

He was quoted by the media as saying that the only reason for his post was to “gain more followers and retweets”; Mas reportedly begged Duterte for forgiveness.

Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, however, said in a statement on Wednesday that “apology is not one of the grounds for extinguishing criminal liability; I cannot feloniously injure another and get away with it by merely saying ‘sorry’”.

Mas’ arrest was followed by police in the Aklan province detaining 40-year-old construction worker Ronald Quiboyen after he allegedly said on his Facebook account that he would “double Mas’ bounty offer to kill the president”. Both men are facing cybercrime-related charges as Mas was released on bail of 72,000 pesos (over 3,000 dollars).

Commenting on the arrests, the NBI vowed that they will continue to take action “against anyone who violates the law”, while the Presidential Security Group (PSG) warned not to make online threats to anyone, including political leaders.

“Anybody can be held liable if he threatens to harm or kill a person, what more if the one that is threatened is the president of the republic”, PSG Commander Colonel Jesus Durante was cited by the media as saying.

Philippines’ Duterte Threatens to Shoot Rioters Amid COVID-19 Lockdown

The detentions come after the Philippine president last month pledged a crackdown on those who violate the confinement measures that were introduced by the government in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I will not hesitate. My orders are for the police, the military and the villages, in case there’s trouble and there’s an occasion where they fight and your life is threatened, shoot them dead”, Duterte said in a televised address to the nation in early April.

On 16 March, he announced a six-month state of emergency in the Philippines, a move that stipulates the so-called “community quarantines” being enforced in most of the country, including on the island of Luzon, which includes the capital, Manila and some neighbourhoods in Quezon City, where mass gatherings are now banned, among other things.

The Philippines has already registered 13,434 COVID-19 cases, with 846 fatalities, according to the World Health Organisation’s latest estimates.",fake
581,821,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-lockdowns-carbon-emissions-india-down-first-time-four-decades/,2020-05-12,Carbon emissions in India are down for the first time in four decades,"Carbon emissions in India have fallen for the first time in nearly 40 years, in large part due to the country's coronavirus lockdown. The data reflects an ongoing trend —2020 is on track to see the largest yearly global decline ever in emissions.

According to an analysis released Tuesday by researchers at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), decreased electricity use and competition from renewable energy sources like wind and solar have weakened demand for fossil fuels in the last year. However, the unexpected lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic is what finally reversed India's 37-year emissions growth trend.

Since early 2019, India has seen a weakened demand for thermal power generation, researchers said. But not until the lockdowns began in March did growth fall below zero, dropping 15 percent that month, and likely about 30 percent in April.

Researchers say the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic has cut India's electricity usage, reducing the need for coal. Coal-fired power generation fell 15 percent in March and 31 percent in the first three weeks of April, while renewables increased by 6.4 percent in March and decreased slightly by 1.4 percent in April.

Coal deliveries were already down 2 percent year-over-year in March, but they have since fallen at least another 10 percent, with imports falling 27.5 percent, the CREA researchers said.

Oil consumption decreased 18 percent in March compared to the previous year. Consumption grew just .2 percent during the fiscal year — the slowest growth in at least 22 years — mostly due to lockdown measures, researchers said. Crude oil production also fell 5.9 percent and refinery production fell 1.1 percent.

Based on the data for coal, oil and gas consumption, researchers estimate that CO2 emissions fell by 30 metric tons. India saw declines in 1970, 1974, 1980 and 1984 — but those dips were minimal compared to this year's decrease.

It's unclear if the country will be able to sustain these environmental improvements after it reopens. The U.S. has relaxed environmental regulations during the pandemic, and there are fears that other counties could do the same.

""The longer-term outlook for India's emissions will be shaped, to a significant degree, by the government response to the crisis,"" researchers said. It ""will have major long-term implications for India's CO2 emissions and air quality trajectory.""

Analysts see three possibilities for governmental intervention needed to keep emissions low: Efforts to reinvigorate renewable energy programs after the lockdown; bailouts and structural changes following massively decreased electricity demand; and a desire to continue combating air pollution after experiencing such drastic improvement in air quality.

Several places in India are already feeling optimistic as they experience clear, blue skies for themselves.

New study says coronavirus detected on tiny particles of air pollution

""In each case, the crisis could act to catalyze, reinforce or accelerate the factors that have already been driving Indian policymaking in this area,"" researchers said. ""Such improvements in air quality are anomalies and if left unchecked following the lockdowns, air pollution will return swiftly and the threats to human health and wellbeing linked to it will persist.""

Increased air pollution leads populations to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, giving governments even more of an incentive to maintain the environmental benefits seen by lockdowns.

And while India implemented its strict nationwide lockdown on March 25, it began easing restrictions earlier this month as part of a multi-phase reopening strategy. The country has seen a dramatic spike in infections since relaxing regulations, with over 73,000 confirmed cases and over 2,400 deaths as of Tuesday.",real

The 208-199 vote, with all but one Republican opposed, advances what boils down to a campaign-season display of Democratic economic and health-care priorities. It has no chance of becoming law as written, but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections.

The enormous Democratic measure would cost more than the prior four coronavirus bills combined. It would deliver almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service.

“Not to act now is not only irresponsible in a humanitarian way, it is irresponsible because it’s only going to cost more,” warned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “More in terms of lives, livelihood, cost to the budget, cost to our democracy.”

Republicans mocked the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list that was dead on arrival in the GOP-led Senate and, for good measure, faced a White House veto threat. Party leaders say they want to assess how $3 trillion approved earlier is working and see if some states’ partial business re-openings would spark an economic revival that would ease the need for more safety net programs.

Republicans are also sorting through internal divisions and awaiting stronger signals from President Donald Trump about what he will support.

“Phase Four is going to happen,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, using Washington insider-speak for the measure. “But it’s going to happen in a much better way for the American people.”

Trump and top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are insisting the next measure should protect reopening businesses from liability lawsuits. The president is also demanding a cut to payroll taxes, but GOP leaders are not yet on board.

The daylong debate painted a Capitol scene that’s become common in the era of coronavirus, even as it remains disconcerting. The sparsely populated House floor was dotted with lawmakers and aides wearing protective masks and even gloves, though some Republicans lacked them.

Many members looked shaggier and sported beards they had not worn weeks ago. Roll call votes lasted over an hour each because lawmakers were voting in small groups to limit crowding.

To enhance the bill’s political impact, Democrats named their measure “The Heroes Act” for the payments it would provide front-line emergency workers. With more than 86,000 Americans dead, 1.4 million confirmed infections and 36 million filing unemployment claims in an frozen economy, Democrats saw GOP opposition as an easy campaign-season target.

“Are you kidding me?” said Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, of Republican assertions that it was time to stop spending more money. “Where do you guys live? Food lines at our food banks around the block? In the United States of America?”

Republicans saw the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They said overly generous unemployment benefits discouraged people from returning to work, and attacked language helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally get federal benefits. They also singled out provisions helping states set up voting by mail and easing the marijuana industry’s access to banks.

“It may help the cannabis industry, but it won’t help Main Street,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

Pelosi pushed the measure through after overcoming party divisions aggravated by election pressures. Some moderate Democrats opposed the package for its price tag and politically fraught provisions like assisting marijuana businesses. A few progressive Democrats were upset because it did not do more, such as guaranteeing workers’ salaries and bolstering their health insurance coverage.

Fourteen Democrats voted against the measure. Nearly all are centrists and number among the party’s most vulnerable lawmakers in November’s elections: freshmen from districts Trump won in 2016.

Among them was Rep. Cindy Axne of Iowa, who labeled the measure “bloated.” Another, Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, tweeted, “This bill strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis, & it has no chance at becoming law.”

Republicans were already planning to use the day’s votes against other moderate Democrats who backed Friday’s legislation and face competitive reelection races.

Clearly, the bipartisan consensus that produced four previous coronavirus bills was crumbling quickly. Polls show GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and aren’t agitating for more. Self-branded deficit hawks are citing the massive increase in the spiraling $25 trillion national debt.

Some congressional aides said the Democratic bill’s real price tag could breach $3.5 trillion. A partial estimate of tax provisions alone revealed eye-popping costs: $412 billion to renew $1,200 cash payments to individuals, more than $100 billion to pay health insurance premiums for the unemployed and $164 billion to make an “employee retention” tax credit for businesses more generous.

Republicans leaders faced disunity between conservatives who feel enough has been done and pragmatists who back rescuing the Postal Service from looming insolvency and delivering cash to revenue-starved state and local governments. The huge price tag and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi cemented GOP opposition.

“This bill is nothing more than the Democratic policy agenda masquerading as a response to the coronavirus crisis,” said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. He said the bill is “going nowhere, and is going nowhere fast.”

Liberal Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also opposed the bill. She told reporters that if constituents ask her if the bill would put money in their pockets or preserve their health care, “I can’t tell them yes.”

The lone Republican backing the legislation was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.",real
593,1502,https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-break-out-of-northern-isolation-trains-coronavirus/,2020-05-19,Sweden looks to break out of its northern isolation,"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
602,1042,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/200-cases-doctors-warn-reports-rare-coronavirus-linked/story?id=70703314,2020-05-15,"With over 200 possible cases, doctors warn reports of rare, coronavirus-linked child inflammatory illness likely to rise","With over 200 possible cases, doctors warn reports of rare, coronavirus-linked child inflammatory illness likely to rise Over half of reported cases are in New York, but at least 20 states see cases.

Medical professionals in 20 states and Washington D.C. are investigating more than 200 confirmed or suspected cases of a mysterious illness thought to be linked to the coronavirus and affecting children, according to a new ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials across the country. And while the unexplained syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, experts said they expect the number to grow.

Experts said the inflammatory syndrome, recently named by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), resembles toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, itself a rare inflammatory disease typically affecting children under the age of five, and has the potential to be deadly. At least three children have died with the syndrome in New York, where at least an additional 119 cases are under investigation, according to the New York State Department of Health.

While the CDC says the group of symptoms is ""associated with"" COVID-19, exact cause remains a mystery.

Many kids, though not all, who experience symptoms of MIS-C -- which include fever, rash, eye irritation, swollen lymph nodes and/or swelling of the hands and feet -- either have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for the antibodies, said health experts. And doctors say even those that have tested negative for antibodies could test positive later because of the lag in antibody development.

According to the CDC, It typically takes one to three weeks after someone becomes infected with the novel coronavirus for their body to make antibodies, and some people could take longer than that.

The illness is only a small percentage of the 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. Dr. Courtney Gidengil, a pediatric infectious disease physician and a policy researcher at the thinktank RAND, said the syndrome is incredibly rare, and parent’s should not panic.

But Gidengil warned the U.S. should expect to see the number of reported cases of the mystery illness rise.

“It seems like it takes four to six weeks for [MIS-C] to develop after infection, not due to the virus itself but rather the body’s response to the illness,” Gidengil said. ""We probably will start to see it pop up more around the entire country.”

There is no current official tally of suspected incidents of the illness nationwide, but an ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. found at least 220 confirmed or possible cases of the illness. The majority of possible cases have been reported in New York, but more than a dozen have also been reported in New Jersey and Michigan, and officials said they also saw potential cases in Massachusetts, Washington D.C., Connecticut, California, Utah, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia and Minnesota.

Some other states like Maryland and North Carolina have told ABC News they don’t have any confirmed cases but are monitoring for any suspected cases.

""I'll wager that's going to only go up and it's going to be much more widespread than anyone thinks,"" New York's Cuomo said.

The CDC sent a warning Thursday to thousands of doctors to be on the lookout for the illness, which was previously known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or PMIS. Friday the government agency said that surveillance of the disease ""is limited,"" but ""now that the case definition and [a health alert] are out, more info is likely to follow.""

Health departments across the country said they have already been on the lookout. Doctors in the U.K., Italy and Spain reported an increase in cases there last month.

The Michigan health department sent out an alert earlier this month to local health agencies and health care providers about the disease and a reminder to report suspected cases within 24 hours. To date, there are 17 suspected cases under review in the state, Michigan health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told ABC News. New Jersey, which has reported a total of 18 cases as of Wednesday, sent out their own alert earlier this month as well.

A doctor in Oregon told ABC News proper knowledge about the illness allowed an afflicted eighth grader to get treatment immediately, which ultimately helped save her.

""I'm very grateful because I could have been gone,"" 14-year old Leah said in an interview with ABC . ""I'm glad I got help right away.""

In California, the state has yet to declare the syndrome a reportable illness, but hospitals have been paying close attention as early as March. Dr. Jim Stein, chief medical officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said the illness is a sign that the impact of the novel coronavirus is extending to children in a way that “this is no longer considered necessarily less significant for children than it is for adults.”

The CDC alert said that “It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.”

But little is known about the illness' connection to COVID-19.

Of the 16 children with inflammatory symptoms in California, 14 have been tested for coronavirus antibodies, Stein said. None of them had tested positive for the coronavirus detection at the time they were admitted to the hospital, but four of them tested positive later. Stein added that the 10 patients that tested negative could also develop antibodies later.

Dr. Andrew Pavia, who has been monitoring two suspected cases at the University of Utah Health Primary Children’s Hospital, said treatments given to patients with the toxic shock related symptoms could also interfere with antibody tests for COVID-19, further complicating the efforts to identify any link between the two.

Health experts are also going back to their current and past patients as they examine more patients and the case definition of the illness broadens from the classic Kawasaki disease, which could increase the number of cases brought forth.

“There's just a lot to worry about with respect to kids,” Alker said. “We really need a national strategy we need our leaders to sort of thoughtfully consider and address this wide range of threats that children face right now to their health and development.”

“And unfortunately there's just no sign that exists right now,” Alker added.

With new illness, questions about summer camps, schools re-opening

The sudden rise in critically ill children, albeit extremely small nationwide, has only further ignited the debate surrounding reopening, especially when it comes to schools.

Most states have decided that school openings will occur on a local level, and for nearly the entire country that decision still hangs in the balance. But the start of summer camps and summer programs is just around the corner, and many states have already moved to allow them to go on. States including Georgia, Tennessee, and Connecticut all have possible cases of MIS-C they have been monitoring in their state but have said summer camps may reopen with various forms of social distancing in place.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, repeatedly warned lawmakers during a hearing on Tuesday about opening schools and businesses too soon, which he said could cause further outbreaks.

“We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be very careful particularly when it comes to children,"" Dr. Fauci warned.

But some lawmakers have been quick to dismiss the warnings, eagerly pushing to open schools in the fall, which are seen as a major indicator of the country being officially opened.

Sen. Rand Paul, R- Kentucky, pushed back on Fauci's calls for cautiousness and said it would be a “huge mistake” not to let kids return to school sooner. President Trump also told reporters Wednesday that he was “surprised” by Fauci’s comments. He said it was “not an acceptable answer.”

""I think that we have to open our schools,"" Trump said in an interview on Wednesday. ""Young people are very little affected by this. We have to get the schools open.""

In Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont and hospitals have recently confirmed that at least five children in the state are being monitored and treated for the new syndrome, the state’s Office of Early Childhood announced this week that summer camps, with the exception of overnight camps, can open on June 29 with specific guidance in place, including a requirement to get a permission to host a group more than 30 as well as other social distancing measures. When schools can reopen there remains a question, as Education Commissioner Miquel Cardona said this week that the school reopening plan will depend on infection trends and that they will need to be flexible.

Georgia Gov. Kemp has implemented a similar measure. Summer camps were permitted to begin operating this week, as long as they follow 32 mandatory criteria that his team developed in absence of the CDC’s guidance. Overnight camps are prohibited. Kemp's office did not respond to a request for comment about how the new illnesses in the state would impact his decisions about schools moving forward.

In most other states, some summer camps are opening up while some other camps are choosing to remain closed amid state governments’ lack of state-wide directives.

In Maryland, Montgomery County this week went ahead and cancelled all summer camps in the county as it awaits for state health department's guidance for camps. Guidance on summer camps is pending in Michigan and Massachusetts as well, while Missouri has left it to counties and cities to decide on the fate of summer camps.

In Utah, the Girl Scouts of Utah has extended the cancellation of “in-person meetings for troops and services of units” until June 30, but YMCA of Northern Utah is moving ahead with its camps while adhering to CDC social distancing guidelines. Schools remain closed through the end of the academic year.

An 'additional risk to consider'

Early concerns about re-opening schools had more to do with the possibility of children potentially transmitting the coronavirus to their teachers, parents or elderly grandparents, who have shown to be much more susceptible to COVID-19's more serious effects.

Pavia said that the new ""scary illness"" affecting kids, while very rare, has only added to the difficult safety calculations.

“I think it's one more factor to put into the very complex decision making about letting kids go back to school in the fall or the summer camps,” Pavia said. “We know that overall they're likelihood of getting severe respiratory disease is very low. We think that MIS-C is a rare but very serious complication, and you know how it's hard to make decisions about rare but serious events.”

“I think for schools, it's just an additional risk to consider,” Pavis added. “I still think that for deciding whether to open schools, the bigger concern is what role children may play in prolonging the epidemic and infecting older people. That's likely to be a much larger impact in terms of numbers. Psychologically, this may have a bigger role.”

In the meantime, health experts are urgently trying to get the word out about the disease so parents can know identify and get their children medical attention as soon as possible.

“Parents: know the signs of Pediatric Multi-Symptom Inflammatory Syndrome to protect your child,” New York City blasted out in its text-message notification system on Friday.

""This is truly disturbing,"" Gov. Cuomo said of the illness at a press conference this week. ""We raise it because it's something parents should be aware of.""

In an open letter posted by Brian Huseman, Amazon’s VP of public policy, the company highlights its own ongoing efforts to try to crack down on price gouging. To date, Amazon says that it’s removed half a million price-gouged listings from its online stores and has banned 4,000 seller accounts on its US store alone for violating its Fair Pricing Policy. And as CEO Jeff Bezos noted in a letter to investors, Amazon has set up a special line of communication for state attorneys general to directly pass along price gouging complaints.

Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own

But Amazon says that it can only do so much on its own. The company says that inconsistent state standards limit its ability to crack down on price gouging — while laws against raising prices during times of crisis currently exist in about two-thirds of the US, the rules are highly inconsistent from state to state. Amazon can kick off as many bad sellers as it can for violating its own policies, but there are often few subsequent legal consequences to help regulate inflated prices.

A federal law, Amazon says, would ensure that there are “no gaps in protection for consumers” and would help Amazon and other retailers “more effectively prevent bad actors and ensure fair prices.”

Amazon’s proposal would see a price gouging law that “should kick in immediately when the federal government declares a public health crisis or national emergency, which will leave no room for doubt for businesses and enforcement agencies. It should also establish clear pricing standards, define who and what are covered by the law, and ensure strong enforcement authority.”

Unsurprisingly, Amazon’s proposed legislation would ensure that only the party that sets the price — like, say, a bad third-party Amazon retailer — be held liable for the inflated price, not the storefront (i.e. Amazon) that hosts that seller and facilitates the sale.",real

Nessel claims that if any worker gets sick at the Ford plant, she could make the determination that it happened because of Trump’s visit and shut the plant down. Even though there is no way this could be proven, these are actions Nessel is willing to consider.

“In Michigan, that is the law,” Nessel said while making an appearance on CNN.

“I think we are going to have to have a very serious conversation with Ford in the event that they permitted the president to be in publicly enclosed places in violation of the order,” Nessel said. “They knew exactly what the order was.”

President Trump hit Nessel back in a Twitter post for her insane threats:

The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2020

President Trump has generally avoided wearing a mask to set an example for Americans not to submit to fear while the fake news media pumps non-stop coronavirus hysteria to Americans who are essentially being held hostage by the shutdown.

Big League Politics reported on how the president thumbed his nose at Nessel and all of the thugs within Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration before his visit to the Ford plant:

Ford will not threaten Trump with an ultimatum to wear the mask. Trump has avoided wearing a mask during public appearances, showing that he will not succumb to the mass hysteria. The president is setting an example for ordinary Americans to overcome the media-induced panic. “As we have said previously, we shared our safety policies and recommendations with the White House in advance of this visit. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,” Ford said in a statement. Trump has refused the advice of the deep state bureaucracy, which wants to scare people into wearing masks. The mask has emerged as a sign of cowardice and obsequiousness throughout the pandemic. “The CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary. You don’t have to do it. But they suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it,” Trump said.

Because Nessel cannot do anything against Trump other than whine, she may attempt to punish the Ford plant and put more people on the unemployment line due to her tantrum.",fake

636,1120,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/covid-19-insurance-coverage-changes/,2020-05-15,COVID-19 Insurance Coverage Changes,"Requiring a coordinated response from the government, healthcare system, and private sector, the COVID-19 outbreak has placed an unprecedented burden and stress on countries across the globe. In the United States, federal policies are being updated rapidly in response to the shifting demands of the healthcare system as it fights to curb the virus. As such, insurance providers are playing a critical role in ensuring widespread access to care and have taken decisive action to help both patients and providers in combating the novel coronavirus.

From state insurance regulators, who are limiting the amounts patients can owe for COVID-19 care, to insurance companies and employers who have amended many rules to eliminate deductibles and co-payments, coverage changes have been occurring on a large scale. As the outbreak is developing and dynamically changing the medical landscape, below are some of the latest policies to go into effect in response to COVID-19.

COVID-19 Testing

Per the latest legislation passed by Congress, coronavirus testing is free for all individuals regardless of insurance status – as is the cost of a doctor’s visit or trip to the emergency room to receive the test. The recently passed Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires all group health plans and individual health insurance providers to cover testing and associated visits related to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, several states, including California, New York, and Washington have implemented additional requirements on insurance companies to cover testing costs.

Both private insurance companies and employers have volunteered to waive the costs of testing. In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires most private health companies to cover testing for COVID-19.

Medicare and Medicaid will also cover the costs of a coronavirus test, while the uninsured should also be able to get tested at no cost per the latest guidelines. Patients who recently lost their jobs may qualify for Medicaid or be able to sign up for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act to gain access to free testing.

COVID-19 Treatment Costs

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, health insurance providers are waiving out-of-pocket costs for hospital visits and many are funding treatment of COVID-19 as well. Cigna and Humana have waived out-of-pocket costs for treatment, as have Aetna, Florida Blue, Harvard Pilgrim and UnitedHealth Group. One of the largest insurers in the nation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, covers nearly 6 million individuals under its Federal Employee Program and has said it would waive co-payments and deductibles for medically necessary treatment.

Although, there are restrictions to the coverage of treatment costs as some insurers have waived cost sharing only for the upcoming two months while others have eliminated expenses only for hospital stays. In addition, it remains unclear how much patients may be required to pay out of pocket; the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates COVID-19 care can cost around $20,000, bringing potential out-of-pocket bills to around $1,300 depending on the patient’s plan, location of care, and disease severity.

COVID-19 Complications Care

Most private insurance plans will likely cover services needed to treat COVID-19 complications although, there is currently no federal guidance requiring them to do so. In addition to covering testing, Medicare will cover both outpatient and hospitalization services. During the COVID-19 crisis, Medicare patients are covered if they need to be transferred to skilled care regardless of previous hospitalization. However, the program does not cover long-term stays in long-term care facilities at this time.

Telemedicine Coverage

According to the latest policy changes, telehealth will now be covered under Part B for all traditional Medicare enrollees for services not limited to COVID-19 care. The definition of telemedicine will be expanded to allow patients to connect with healthcare providers from their homes via video conferencing or other digital methods. To further ease access to care, the requirement that telemedical care be provided by a medical professional the patient has seen within the last three years has been waived.

The widespread shift to telehealth has proven critical to easing the burden on the U.S. healthcare system by “allowing hospitals to care for people who need it most, while limiting the exposure of health care workers and patients to the disease,” explains a one-pager published by America’s Health Insurance Plans. “Telehealth is especially beneficial for patients who are at a higher risk when leaving the home to commute to the doctor’s office.”

Out-of-Network Bills

Despite the significant efforts made toward expanding insurance coverage at this time, patients may still be required to pay out-of-network bills, for example, when they are treated by an out-of-network physician. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicate that nearly one in five patients admitted to the hospital with serious cases of pneumonia were faced with out-of-network bills after treatment. To further ease patients’ financial burden related to COVID-19, some hospital systems are pausing collections for the foreseeable future.

Alongside the aforementioned updates, many insurance coverage providers are proposing further changes to expand coverage and ease the financial burden during this COVID-19 crisis. Healthcare providers should remain current on the latest developments in coverage policies as they may affect both themselves as well as their patients.

The collapse of oil prices at the start of March after Russia withdrew from the OPEC+ deal was a disaster for Moscow, which remains heavily reliant on oil exports to fund the budget.

But then an odd thing happened: the price of oil lost 56 percent of its value in the year to date, as of May 7, but the ruble is down by only 19 percent over the same period. Like some Tibetan monetary monk, the ruble’s value has managed to levitate and stay up, even as the oil-price ground fell away from underneath it.

Also on rt.com Once he recovers from Covid-19, PM Mishustin faces new ordeal – reviving economy & Kremlin’s popularity with thinning oil kitty

The ruble’s value has long been tied to the price of oil and the two used to move in lockstep. That changed when the Russian Ministry of Finance introduced the so-called budget rule (aka the financial rule), which automatically siphons off any excess oil-export revenue to the National Welfare Fund (NWF) for all revenues earned from oil prices over US$42.

That rule led to the buildup of the reserve fund, which held 12 trillion rubles, or 11 percent of GDP as of April 1, and helped bring down inflation to post-Soviet lows, but, most importantly, largely broke the tie between the ruble’s value and the price of oil.

That has changed now. Since oil prices have fallen below the key US$42 for a cost of a barrel of oil threshold, the budget rule doesn’t make any difference anymore, so oil prices and the value of the ruble should re-engage.

The average value of the ruble in 2018 was 62.7 rubles to the dollar, while the average price of oil was US$70.8. In 2019, the price of oil fell 11.4 percent to US$62.7, while the value of the ruble fell by less, down only 3.2 percent to 64.7, mainly thanks to the steadying effect of the budget rule.

Also on rt.com Covid-19 quarantine could cost Russia $242 BILLION as oil price fall starts to hit budget income

But the changes in the first four months of 2020 have been a lot more dramatic. The average price of oil has shrunk by a third (31.2 percent) to US$43.1 over the first four months – including January and February, when oil prices were US$63.7 and US$55.7 respectively— whereas the average value of the ruble over this period was 68.7 to the dollar, down by only 6 percent.

Even in March and April, the peak of the crisis, the average cost of oil dropped to US$32 and then US$21.2, respectively, or by another quarter (25.8 percent), followed by another collapse by a third (33.6 percent) the following month, but the value of the ruble in those two months was 73.7 and 75.2, down by 7.3 percent in March and a mere 1.9 percent in April.

That’s not to say the ruble has not been battered by the current crisis, which is considered the worst since 1998’s total meltdown of Russia’s financial system, as the chart of the weekly exchange rates of ruble vs dollar shows. But how can the value of the ruble in Russia’s petro-dependent economy defy gravity so easily?

CBR to the rescue

One of the reasons why Russia is expected to weather this crisis a lot better than many of its emerging-markets peers is that Central Bank of Russia (CBR) governor Elvira Nabiullina allowed the ruble to float freely as part of her response to the 2014 oil shock, when oil prices collapsed the last time.

As bne IntelliNews has argued elsewhere, the Kremlin is fixated on preserving Russia’s foreign exchange reserves, which totaled US$569.7 billion as of April 1, because it regards them as a strategic asset. The size of Russia’s reserves means it is impervious to sanctions as it can simply buy its way out of trouble if the US imposes harsh sanctions, without the need to borrow on the international capital markets that would make it vulnerable to sanction pressure.

The CBR has shown it’s prepared to allow the exchange rate to take the brunt of the oil shock to preserve those reserves, and has not been defending its currency, unlike many countries, Turkey notable among them, that have also seen their currencies collapse. Moreover, the money in the NWF also won’t be used to defend the ruble as that money is solely tasked with supporting the budget and covering the 3–4 trillion-ruble federal budget deficit expected this year.

During the 2014 oil-price shock, the ruble also tanked, and by a lot more. Before that crisis, it had been trading at about 35 rubles to the dollar for several years, but it suddenly dropped to a nadir of circa 80 to the dollar.

Investors freaked out and called Nabiullina reckless and incompetent, but then, as now, she refused to burn through Russia’s reserves to defend an indefensible exchange rate.

That crisis started in October and peaked in December, when the CBR finally imposed a 17 percent emergence rate hike on December 16, 2014 to put a floor under the collapse of the currency. The ruble has lost a lot less value than it did in those few months in 2014, which has meant both the investors and the population have greeted this crisis with greater calm than in 2014. And it also means the economic damage done by this crisis – as far as currency effects are concerned – is mild by comparison.

Amazingly, unlike 2014, when the CBR made the biggest one-off rate hike in Russian history, the CBR actually cut rates by an aggressive 50bp at its last policy meeting in April to 5.5 percent, in an effort to give the economy a growth-boosting shot in the arm. April’s cut in rates demonstrates an entirely different mindset.

Usually, during a crisis, emerging-market central banks are forced to hike rates to protect their currency, as Russia did in 2014, whereas developed-market economies cut them to boost growth. And, indeed, the first thing the US Federal Reserve did in April was cut US interest rates to zero.

Nabiullina had a difficult choice in April, as she could have gone both ways: cut rates to boost growth, or hike rates to head off inflation caused by the devaluation of the ruble. But it is a testimony to the effective management of Russia’s central bank since she took over in 2013 that she had a choice, and ended up choosing the developed market’s response to a nasty external shock.

Defending the ruble

The CBR abandoned the “ruble exchange rate corridor” at the end of 2014 – a mechanism that had been in place for almost two decades and obliged it to manage the value of the ruble’s value and stop rapid devaluations.

Russia’s reserves fell this year from a peak of just over US$580 billion to just under US$570 billion as of the start of April, but most of that fall is due to foreign-exchange revaluation effects of the assets the CBR uses to hold Russia’s reserves. The CBR has spent a mere circa US$2 billion of actual cash in the past month in money-market interventions to smooth out the fall in the ruble’s value, which is very little.

Indeed, astonishingly, Russia’s reserves have actually increased this year, by just over US$7 billion from US$562.3 billion, as of January 1. The reserves fell slightly from US$570.3 billion in February to US$563.4 billion in March, but, amazingly, then grew again in April to the current US$569.7 billion.

The CBR will not touch Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves to defend the value of the ruble, and it can’t use the money in the NWF either, which technically belong to the Ministry of Finance. However, the government has come up with a dodge to make more dollars available to the CBR to defend the ruble, which explains its gravity-defying performance over the past two months.

Also on rt.com Russia has enough reserves to protect its people amid coronavirus pandemic – Putin

On April 11, the CBR rushed through a deal to sell its 50 percent+1 stake in the state-owned retail banking giant Sberbank to the Ministry of Finance for 2.14 trillion rubles (US$29.1 billion). The change of ownership solves several problems in one go. First, the central bank was in the uncomfortable position of both being the banking-sector regulator and the owner of by far the largest bank in the sector. Now that bank is owned by the Ministry of Finance, which is how it should be.

Second, the deal will put more money into the budget. Sberbank is the most profitable bank in the sector, and recently promised to increase its dividend payments to 50 percent of its income, because the government increasingly uses dividends to tap the profits of its best companies, rather than taxes. However, the CBR regularly held back part of those payments to keep on its own balance sheet.

Now, all of Sberbank’s dividends will be paid directly into the budget. Third, the deal, in effect, provides a back-door route for the CBR to tap the NWF, giving it cash to spend in the money markets to defend the ruble. The Ministry of Finance paid for the deal using NWF money, which has now dropped to about 9 trillion rubles.

This last point is key, as the CBR’s alternative to holding up the ruble’s value was to hike rates again, which would have killed off whatever growth the Russian economy is due to put in during its recovery from April’s crash.

Just how the CBR will use this money remains unclear, but the US$29 billion it now has is thought to be enough to defend the ruble until September, by which time the government hopes the situation will have stabilized and oil prices will have recovered enough to take the pressure off the government’s finances, especially after the OPEC++ production-cut deal that will reduce production of oil by 9.7mbpd and was signed on April 13.

“The CBR will be gradually selling [the US$29bn] until the end of September, [as long] as the price of Urals stays below US$25 a barrel,” Ivan Tkachev, the economics editor of RBC, said in a recent article.

“Since the onset of these interventions, the [Russian benchmark blend] Urals price has never exceeded the threshold, and the CBR sold more than US$2 billion in April. The more Russian oil deviates from US$25, the higher the amount of currency sold by the CBR. Thus, the central bank is effectively compensating for the shortfall of export earnings, supplying the domestic market with that amount of currency as if the Urals price was US$25.”

The CBR’s currency sales will automatically protect the ruble from depreciating too much while oil prices stay low, and buys the government five months of time for the worst effects of the crisis to fade. At US$25 per barrel, the estimated fair value of the ruble is 75–76 rubles to the dollar, estimates Tkachev.

The price of Brent was US$30.97 as of May 9 and the value of the ruble was 73.4 rubles – slightly better than Tkachev’s lower band estimate of oil and exchange-rate forecasts. And the Sberbank money is not the only resources that the government has brought to the ruble’s defense. In addition to the CBR’s own operations, the Ministry of Finance also sells currency on the money markets. The CBR’s statistics aggregate data on both mechanisms, since it’s the CBR, which is the currency sales agent in both cases, says Tkachev.

“Unlike the CBR’s variable sales, the Finance Ministry’s operations are fixed one month in advance. In April, its daily foreign-currency sales amount to the equivalent of 3.5 billion rubles (circa US$46 million). But from March 10, when the CBR launched currency interventions on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, until April 22, more than US$5 billion was sold using both channels,” says Tkachev.

The sale of dollars under the fiscal rule is not happening, as oil prices are under the key US$42 per barrel level. However, on May 8, the CBR formalized an informal ‘auxiliary fiscal rule.’ The CBR announced that it will intervene in the foreign-exchange markets when Russia’s Urals blend of oil (which usually costs about US$2 less than Brent) drops below US$25.

That means the CBR will sell an additional US$0.5– 1.5 billion on the open market for every US$5/bbl decline in the Urals oil price below the lower threshold, analysts at VTB Capital estimate.

“That’s the main reason the ruble has not followed oil prices down in their dramatic plunge,” says Tkachev.

Every U.S. state has implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.

State officials are now charting paths to a new normal, seeking a balance between reopening economies and protecting public health. Many governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states as they ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery. Most are releasing general and industry-specific reopening guidelines for businesses and individuals.

President Trump's federal guidelines for social distancing and mitigation expired on May 1. Many states are modifying stay-at-home orders, prolonging school closures or delaying elections until after that date. Many are also lifting certain restrictions as they embark on phased-in recovery plans. And while more than half of states have partially reopened, public health experts say that some are doing so too quickly, as they warn of a second wave of infections. At a May 12 Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern about some states and localities skipping federal guidelines to open prematurely.

Governors have created their own data dashboards and task forces to guide their planning, and provide regular progress updates. Conditions and predictions differ across states, though there is broad consensus that reopening will not happen overnight.

As of Thursday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 12,276 cases where the patient is white, 11,848 among Latinos, and 11,353 in the black community.

Last week, on April 22, there were about 7,800 patients who were white, 5,800 who identified as Latino and 8,100 who were African American.

The dramatic rise in cases among Latinos is reflective of better testing capabilities and greater awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, but public health experts are raising concerns about the state’s reach among Latino communities in their efforts to contain the pandemic.

“The trend that we’re seeing is that cases among the Latino community are doubling at a faster rate than everyone else, but the response has been limited in those emerging hotspots,” said Aida Giachello, a medical sociologist at Northwestern University and member of the Illinois Latino Covid-19 Initiative, a community outreach group.

“We want sufficient attention and resources to tackle the virus in our community. We need better messaging on what to do if you contract the virus and how to protect others, especially in Spanish.”

Of the coronavirus cases where a patient’s race and ethnicity was reported, 31% are white, 29% are black and 30% are Latino, according to the state health department. About a quarter of the state’s nearly 53,000 cases do not list the patient’s race or ethnicity.

By way of comparison, whites account for 60% of the state’s population, Latinos make up 17%, and African Americans account for 14%.

About 2,400 Illinoisans have died from COVID-19, 40% of whom were white, 35% were black and 14% were Latino.

Arise Chicago labor organizer Jorge Mujica said another reason behind the rising cases among Latinos is they are at high risk of contracting the virus at their workplaces.

“It’s obvious that the source of the spread of the virus has shifted from people traveling to people working, and we know Latinos and African Americans are more likely to work outside their homes,” he said.

Mujica said Latino workers across the state have complained to him about employers not providing proper equipment and work conditions that don’t allow for social distancing.

“Labor laws are violated everyday, this is nothing new, and so we’re seeing the same thing when it comes to the new coronavirus rules and guidelines,” he said.

State figures show many ZIP codes reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases encompass predominantly Latino working-class areas like Little Village and Belmont Cragin in Chicago and suburbs like Cicero.

March 30, 2020

“If you can administer Vitamin C intravenously starting in the Emergency Room and every 6 hours thereafter, while in the hospital, the mortality rate of this disease and the need for mechanical ventilators will likely be greatly reduced,” says Dr. Pierre Kory, the Medical Director of the Trauma and Life Support Center and Chief of the Critical Care Service at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. He explains that it’s the inflammation sparked by the Coronavirus, not the virus itself, that kills patients. Inflammation causes a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which damages the lungs so that patients, suffering fever, fatigue, and the sense that their inner chest is on fire, eventually cannot breathe without the help of a ventilator.

The University of Wisconsin in Madison has included intravenous Vitamin C as part of its treatment guideline. It’s part of a combination therapy protocol developed in 2017 by Dr. Paul E. Marik at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Dr. Marik gives critically ill patients inexpensive, readily available intravenous doses of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine (“HAT” therapy) within 6 hours of entering an emergency room. In Dr. Marik’s study, published in 2017 in the journal “Chest” by the American College of Chest Physicians, his team reported that in the first 47 patients treated with HAT therapy the death rate was 8.5% compared to 40.4% in patients not treated with HAT. Further, in a recent study by Dr. Kory’s team involving a large series of patients suffering septic shock, including many with pneumonia, they found that early IV administration of these same vitamins and steroids was critical to survival. The risk of mortality increased with each 6 hours of delay.

When the Coronavirus pandemic hit China, Chinese doctors were quick to use intravenous Vitamin C. When their patients tested positive for COVID-19, the Chinese added 2 inexpensive, FDAapproved drugs hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial) and zithromax (antibiotic) to the IV and gave patients oral doses of 2 supplements: melatonin and zinc. The combination likely worked given that their reported mortality rates are lower than reported elsewhere in the world The link to the Shanghai expert consensus on comprehensive care for COVID-19 patients is attached. The Chinese tried to do a clinical trial of IV Vitamin C, but Dr. Richard Z.Cheng, working with the investigators in Shanghai told Dr. Marik that it was very difficult to get patients to enter the trial. However, of the first 50 patients treated, no-one died!

When COVID-19 cases hit Virginia, Dr. Marik used his full HAT protocol (IV hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine) on ARDS patients in the ICU, while also adding the drugs and supplements used by the Chinese. The results have been remarkable. He recently saved four COVID-19 patients, including an 86-year old man with heart disease who was admitted to the hospital on 100% oxygen, by using the protocol. (86-year old men with heart disease do not normally survive COVID-19!)

Dr. Joseph Varon at United General Hospital in Houston, Texas, is using the protocol and, to date, has saved 16 lives. He reports that they are getting off the ventilator in 48 hours instead of 10 - 21 days! That means far fewer hospital beds and ventilators needed — as well as fewer coffins.

The big question is: Why aren’t many more U.S. hospitals adopting this protocol? “The only reason I can give is that there is widespread, and often well-founded, bias amongst physicians against the use of vitamin therapy,” says Dr. Kory. He adds, “The persistence of this bias is inexplicable given that the evidence is in plain sight.” He points out that despite the publication of a major study of intravenous Vitamin C in ARDS (the syndrome that is killing patients with COVID-19), which reported dramatic reductions in mortality, days on the ventilator, and days in the ICU, only a minority of critical care doctors adopted the therapy as part of routine practice.

One hospital chain disallowed the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19. That's because doctors are taught that steroids increase the growth of viruses and that steroids harm patients with influenza. Drs. Marik, Varon, and Kory all agree that, for this reason, steroids should not be given early to a patient with influenza or coronavirus. But Dr. Kory says evidence does not show harm of steroids in previous coronavirus epidemics such as SARS and MERS, especially when given late inthe disease. When the diagnosis is COVID-19, and especially when the inflammatory response begins to cause deterioration in breathing or the need for a ventilator, steroids should be added. Thesteroids are in the formula to fight the life-threatening inflammation. In fact, all of the formula’s ingredients are needed, together, to get maximum life-saving results.

New York Internist Dr. Keith Berkowitz adds that, “in this time of crisis, when ventilators are in limited supply, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and medical staff lack adequate protective gear and are putting their lives on the line, every hospital needs to try this safe, low-cost and highly effective treatment that leading specialists know saves lives in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is not the time to wait months for a vaccine or years for more test results. The important thing now is to keep patients off ventilators and to save lives. Period.”",fake

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of Northwestern University’s Institute of Global Health, warned that those disobeying the statewide stay-at-home order are exacerbating the public health crisis as he blasted the forces pushing to immediately reopen the economy.

“Look on the street. Only half of the people are wearing a mask,” Murphy said Wednesday. “There’s data from the phone companies about how people move. They’re moving around more. There’s definitely more traffic.”

While he said the pervasive toll is also attributable in part to increased testing and workers returning to their jobs, Murphy noted that keeping social distancing measures in place longer — and following them — is vitally important for beating back the coronavirus.

Recent figures have shown the disease is still spreading rapidly through communities. On Tuesday, state officials reported 4,014 new cases of COVID-19, the most recorded in a single day. And on Wednesday, the 192 reported deaths marked another grim benchmark.

“The same thing happened in northern Italy and in Spain, where they just felt like they were not getting ahead,” Murphy said. “It finally turned around there when they got serious with all the shelter-in-place.

“But I mean, everybody here seems to be just ready to chuck it and just go back to doing what they’re doing.”

Murphy specifically took aim at leaders pushing to relax restrictions locally. As he sees it, the clearest way to vanquish the disease is actually to “tighten it up.”

“They should not be loosening up. You know, like McHenry County and DuPage County want to have their own rules. Idiots!” he said, apparently referencing a push by leaders in the collar counties to be moved into a region in the governor’s Restore Illinois plan that doesn’t include Cook County in hopes they can reopen businesses sooner.

Meanwhile, both Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike spent a good portion of Wednesday’s news conference harping on the fact that the virus remains a real and serious threat.

“This virus is still among us,” Pritzker said. “This pandemic is not over. And to pretend otherwise in a misguided attempt to reclaim what we’ve lost will only make this last longer.”

J.B. Pritzker said at his Sunday briefing. “We don’t have enough swabs.”

Earlier on Sunday, Pritzker said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” “Recently we got a call from the White House telling us that in May they’re sending us 600,000 swabs, and I’m very grateful for that.”

What is a swab?

It’s an item as light as a feather but in short supply as the demand for COVID-19 testing grows. Mass testing is key to trying to reopen our lives, schools and economy.

The federal Food and Drug Administration in recent weeks has expanded swab testing options and materials, fast tracking decision making in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Swabs are essential to collecting samples from a nose or throat. Swabs are put in a package with a reagent — it could be some kind of a liquid — to preserve the sample. The sample is sent to a lab with a testing machine to see if it is positive for COVID-19.

No swab, no test.

Merriam Webster defines a swab as “a wad of absorbent material usually wound around one end of a small stick and used especially for applying medication or for removing material from an area.”

That definition doesn’t go far enough.

Medical swabs for COVID-19 testing, it turns out, are quite bespoke tools. Here are seven things to know about swabs in the era of the novel coronavirus:

• Q-tip, the best known swab brand used every day for a variety of purposes, is made of 100% pure cotton and is bonded to a short paper stick. It is not approved by the FDA for COVID-19 testing.

According to STAT, the health and medical publication, a Q-tip does not work for testing “in part due to the fact that the cotton on the tip contains its own DNA; cotton, after all, is a plant.” That DNA could be confused with the DNA from the testing sample and trigger a false result.

The swabs being used currently are nylon or foam, STAT reported.

• Most COVID-19 testing swabs used in the U.S. are made mainly by two companies: Puritan Medical Products in Maine and a company in Italy, a coronavirus outbreak epicenter.

• Not all medical swabs are the same. There are COVID-19 testing swabs for use by health professionals and swabs for self-collection that are just emerging on the market.

Tests used by the pros involve swabs on long sticks that can reach deep into a throat or nasal cavity, an uncomfortable procedure. That means the person collecting the specimen has to use PPE — personal protective equipment, also in short supply. Self collection means less need for PPE.

• On April 16, there was a breakthrough. The FDA allowed fully synthetic swabs to be made with polyester tips to be used on shorter sticks. These Q-tip size polyester swabs can be used for front of the nose testing and sent to the lab preserved in a saline solution.

Front of the nose testing is “notable,” the FDA said, “because it allows self-collection for patients, thereby limiting exposure of health care providers; it is more comfortable for patients, and it can be performed by a swab that is more readily available and manufacturable at scale.”

• With the FDA approval, U.S. Cotton, based in Cleveland, was able to launch the large-scale manufacture of polyester swabs.

• While cotton has not been used on COVID-19 swabs, on April 21, the FDA, using emergency authorization, gave permission to the Laboratory Corporation of America, known as LabCorp, to use a specially made Q-tip style cotton swab it developed for home collection kits.

Addressing the exception allowing the use of cotton, an FDA spokeswoman said, “These swabs have been evaluated to see if they caused false negatives/positives or if they impacted the controls [which they do not].”

During the pandemic, the FDA said it has been working with more than 380 test developers.

• On April 29, the Department of Defense announced it was awarding a $75.5 million contract to Puritan Medical Products using the Defense Production Act. A Pentagon spokesman said that will “quickly” double its capacity to 40 million swabs a month, with production to begin in May.

Pritzker said last week on NBC’s “Today” show that the White House was “promising to deliver to us for the month of May about 20,000 swabs per day, which is very important.” The state is also procuring swabs through its own sources, with no number available of what’s on hand.

Pritzker’s aim is to have enough swabs for 18,000 tests per day, with the average now at about 15,000, spokesman Jordan Abudayyeh said.

“We need as many swabs as we can get our hands on,” she said.",real

Workers who cannot perform their tasks from home have now been encouraged to return to action, and the public are now able to spend more time outside, as long as social distancing is maintained.

But has the messaging from Westminster been clear enough? Political Commentator Mandy Boylett gave her views on the matter.

Sputnik: Is Westminster right to begin loosening the UK’s Coronavirus lockdown?

Mandy Boylett: I think Boris Johnson is right to loosen the lockdown, because the devastation to the economy, and also the collateral damage to people’s health is too great, and I think that it is a very difficult balancing act, but I would have been tempted to release the lockdown further.

Sputnik: Has the messaging from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson regarding what the public can and can’t do once the Coronavirus lockdown is relaxed, clear enough?

Mandy Boylett: I think what he said is clear, but I think that it doesn’t make any sense. The fact that you can stay two metres apart from strangers in the park, but not your own family, the fact that you can have cleaners in your home, but not your own family, there are a lot of mixed messages there.

We need the police to be sensible as well. Say if my husband and I wanted to go and see a family member and go out exercising and stay two metres apart; to my mind that would be fine, but the police could say “both of you are out”, it should be just the husband or the wife, but that doesn’t make any sense because if one catches something, the other one would, so when messages like that don’t make any sense, then people are not likely to follow them.

Sputnik: Could the British Government have done more to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus within the UK?

Mandy Boylett: With the benefit of hindsight; there are a few things that I think they could have done. Instead of introducing the fourteen day quarantine now, they should have done it right at the start before there were any Coronavirus infections within the UK.

If after that any cases did emerge; and you were testing them and then tracing them, then that would have really helped, but instead they were letting people come directly from Wuhan and Italy, straight through the airports with no checks.

The other thing that they could have handled better are the care homes. The elderly patients were cleared out of the hospitals to make room in the hospitals for the influx of Coronavirus patients that were being expected, but these elderly people were being sent to care homes, they were not being tested for Coronavirus, and the consequence of that was the massive infection rate in care homes.

That could have been avoided, if the care homes had just closed their doors at the start; then they would not have had many infected patients, and it would never have happened, so those to me are the two things that went really badly wrong at the start.",fake

According to the FDA both tests were given the green light within 24 hours of receiving their applications, this allows for immediate use of Thermo Fischer’s TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit on its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real time hardware within certain laboratories across America.

The company says the test is designed to detect the specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis.

""The authorization of our diagnostic test for COVID-19 will help to protect patients and enable medical staff to respond swiftly to treat those who are ill and prevent the spread of infection,"" said Thermo Fisher’s chairman, president and CEO, Marc Casper. “In partnership with the FDA and regulatory authorities around the world, we are committed to expanding the availability of diagnostic testing to prevent the spread of this disease.""

FDA authorizations for the tests allow them both to be used in the clinic without a full agency approval during a public health emergency which was first declared on January 31, 2020. The CDC has also updated their guidance which will increase the demand for testing; criteria now also includes healthcare personnel or any person that has had direct contact with an infected person in the 2 weeks since displaying symptoms and anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for a prolonged period of time.

Dianostic’s Qiagen, which is Thermo Fisher’s latest acquisition has received funding boosts from the American government to develop its own coronavirus test, announcing a $11.5 billion deal to acquire Qiagen after a few months of mediation; BARDA provided Qiagen with $598,000 to accelerate development of its cartridge based QIAstat-Dx test kit to distinguish COVID-19 from 21 other respiratory infections, according to the company results can be provided in an hour from the testing panel.

“We have scaled up production to respond to the rapid spread of COVID-19, moving to 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operations at two key sites, investing to expand capacity by 70% and adding staff,” said interim CEO Thierry Bernard, who also heads the company’s molecular diagnostics business area.

“Our top priority is producing the QIAamp and EZ1 sample technologies recommended in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidelines for testing, as well as the new QIAstat-Dx cartridges,” Bernard said. “We are working closely with laboratories, hospitals and other customers around the world to assess their flexibility, timing and quantity needs.”",fake

The company, which reported first quarter earnings for 2020 on Wednesday, says “a record number of people” are using its services, primarily its Messenger and WhatsApp chat apps as well as Instagram. Last month, as the pandemic intensified, Facebook said it was seeing spikes of more than 50 percent on its messaging products and now logs about 700 million daily calls across Messenger and WhatsApp.

Facebook knows its growth is temporary, and it could make less money than expected next quarter

But the company knows its popularity is likely only temporary. And those products that are seeing spikes are not the ones Facebook can most easily monetize, as analytics chief Alex Schultz and engineering chief Jay Parikh admitted last month in an illuminating blog post.

“We don’t monetize many of the services where we’re seeing increased engagement, and we’ve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19,” the duo wrote. “We’re just trying to keep the lights on over here,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The New York Times in an interview.

Combined with the pandemic’s effects on consumer buying habits and marketing budgets, both of which are expected to continue falling dramatically in the coming months, Facebook’s core advertising business may take a serious hit come next quarter.

Related Mark Zuckerberg on how video chat needs to evolve for the pandemic

Both Facebook and Google are the most dominant web advertising platforms in the industry, and yet some of the biggest spenders, including travel and dining-related websites and companies, are all slashing marketing spend during the coronavirus crisis. That will, over time, create big holes in both companies’ ad revenue, so long as the shelter-in-place orders remain in effect for large ad markets like the US and Europe.

“Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and, like all companies, we are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook,” reads the company’s forward-looking statement. “We expect our business performance will be impacted by issues beyond our control, including the duration and efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, the effectiveness of economic stimuli around the world, and the fluctuations of currencies relative to the US dollar.”

3 billion people now use a Facebook product at least once a month

In particular, Facebook says it’s watching out for drops in engagement. “We expect that we will lose at least some of this increased engagement when various shelter-in-place restrictions are relaxed in the future.” It also starting feeling the downturn in the global advertising industry over the course of the last month. “We experienced a significant reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads, over the last three weeks of the first quarter of 2020,” the company said.

For now, however, Facebook’s key numbers are looking good. The company reported revenue of $17.7 billion and profit of $4.9 billion, 18 percent and 102 percent jumps from this time last year, respectively. The number of people who log into Facebook daily jumped 11 percent from Q1 2019 to 1.7 billion, while the number of monthly active users increased by 10 percent to 2.6 billion.

The “Family daily active people” and “Family monthly active people” figures, both of which measure when a user has used at least one of Facebook’s various products in those time frames, both hit record highs of 2.4 billion and 3 billion, respectively.

Another bright spot is that Facebook’s non-ad business, including its Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal family of video chat devices, is up 80 percent this quarter from a year ago, to nearly $300 million.

Something that jumped out to me in results: non-advertising revenue was up 80 percent year over year. People are buying Facebook + Oculus hardware https://t.co/FU1NJ4U7dQ — Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) April 29, 2020

Facebook is also currently investing heavily in improving its messaging products to take advantage in the boom in video chatting, teleconferencing, and live-streaming. The company last week announced Messenger Rooms, a more robust version of its chat platform that will allow up to 50 people to join a video call. It also said it would double the capacity of WhatsApp video chatting from four people to eight, add video chatting to its dating platform, and add new live-streaming features to the main Facebook app and Instagram.

Despite Facebook’s warnings about the future, investors seem pleased with its present performance. The company’s stock is now up nearly 10 percent in after-hours trading.",real

TAMPA, Fla. – Tom Brady isn’t letting the coronavirus pandemic – or NFL rules against players working out at team facilities – keep him from preparing for a new season with his new Tampa Bay team.

Brady gathered some of his new Buccaneers teammates on a high school field early Tuesday for a throwing session. Brady wore a Buccaneers helmet and an orange jersey over his shoulder pads. The informal, players-only workout at Berkeley Preparatory School lasted two hours, according to The Tampa Bay Times.

It’s not unusual for quarterbacks to organize passing workouts before training camp, but the pandemic has changed normal routines. Teams have had to rely on virtual meetings instead of traditional offseason programs as the NFL tries to make plans for a 2020 season, possibly without fans.

NFL RECORD PROJECTIONS:Will Tom Brady or Drew Brees lead Super Bowl push?

INSTANT IMPACT:Twenty NFL rookies who could make waves in 2020 season

Because of the pandemic which has forced social distancing and sheltering at home as the new rules, any gathering of players is notable – especially one involving Brady, a six-time Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots. Brady, 42, signed a two-year, $50 million contract with the Bucs in March.

After signing with the Bucs, Brady asked for phone numbers of his teammates. He apparently made use of that list to organize Tuesday’s workout.

It was an encouraging sign for fans on the same day NFL teams began opening facilities to a limited number of personnel. The facilities are still off-limits for coaches and players, except for players undergoing injury rehabilitation.

Center Ryan Jensen practiced shotgun snaps to Brady on the artificial turf football field.

Though he’s the newcomer, Brady was in charge, according to the paper. Brady walked through a route with receiver Mike Evans, demonstrating for the veteran and other players exactly where to make their cuts.

Quarterbacks Blaine Gabbert and Ryan Griffin also threw passes.

Among other players attending the session were receiver Scotty Miller, tight ends Cameron Brate and O.J. Howard and running back Dare Ogunbowale.

Teams cannot organize such workouts, and the Buccaneers did not publicize Tuesday’s session.

There was no immediate reply from the team to a request from The Associated Press for comment on the workout.

Tuesday’s workout went better than Brady’s attempt to work out privately at a Tampa park last month. After he was told by a security guard that the park was closed and he had to leave, Brady received an apology from mayor Jane Castor.",real
714,1370,https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/05/18/coronavirus-parking-lots-reopen-at-27-california-state-parks/,2020-05-18,Coronavirus: Parking lots reopen at 27 California state parks,"Parking lots are slowly beginning to re-open at some of California’s state parks.

Over the weekend, and without an official announcement, the state began to partially reopen lots at 27 state parks and beaches in Santa Cruz, San Benito, Sonoma, Riverside and Orange counties, along with the Lake Tahoe Area, and several other mostly rural parts of the state.

In most of the re-opened parking lots, 50% or fewer of the parking spaces will be available.

California has 280 state parks. As of Monday, 36 were closed and 244 were open. State parks officials have closed the parking lots in the parks that are open as a way to encourage only local visitors and reduce crowd size.

Gloria Sandoval, deputy director of California’s state parks department, said Monday that the state was able to reopen some lots starting Friday after consultation with local and state health officials. She said that the department expects visitors not to travel across county lines, and to go only to their local parks, as a way to reduce overcrowding until conditions continue to improve and more rules can be relaxed.

“We are still telling people to stay close to home,” she said. “It’s important for everybody to do their part to help mitigate the spread of the virus.”

Sandoval recommended that anyone planning to visit a state park first look up the website for that individual park to see the latest rules at www.parks.ca.gov. All beaches in Santa Cruz County, for example, are closed daily between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., by local order, with violators subject to $1,000 fines — although swimming and surfing are permitted.

Guided tours, campgrounds, museums and visitor centers remain closed at all state parks, although trails are open at many.

The state parks where parking lots have partially reopened, by county, are:

Butte County

Lake Oroville State Recreation Area

El Dorado County

Ed Z’berg Sugar Pine Point State Park

On Monday, as he relaxed some rules around California, Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked when he would be opening state parks parking lots, following reports that it was difficult for the elderly and disabled visitors to visit the ones that are open.

“There are 27 proof points that that was done in the last few days,” Newsom said.

Newsom and parks officials continue to urge state parks visitors to practice physical distancing and avoid congregating with people outside their immediate household.",real

If “flattening the curve” was indeed the objective in states like California, the objective was inarguably met long ago. We could debate whether or not the lockdown was the reason for that outcome, but what is not up for legitimate debate is the fact that hospitals in California being overwhelmed never even came close to becoming a reality.

How distant from reality is that possibility right now? So distant, in fact, that Sleep Train Arena, former home to the Sacramento Kings, was set up to handle the coming and unmanageable influx of Covid-19 patients, but as of May 6, just six Covid-19 patients were residing there.

Photo credit: CLopez63

At that precise moment, across Sacramento County, just 27 hospital beds were being used to treat Covid-19 patients.

Why were there 6 patients in beds at Sleep Train Arena, rather than in the ample open beds in the California capital’s hospitals? Well, perhaps that’s explained by the fact that the state government is paying the Sacramento Kings organization $500,000 a month for using the empty arena as an emergency medical facility, plus, of course, the required labor, food, and supply contracts.

The truth, as Placer County Board of Supervisors representative Kirk Uhler reminds Gavin Newsom in an email, is that the Newsom’s “state of emergency declaration must be rescinded, because the conditions required for a state of emergency no longer exist” in the area around Sacramento, particularly.

State law allows statewide emergency declarations by the Governor only if “local authority is inadequate to cope with the emergency.” “Eight people in our hospitals,” Uhler says. “668 bed capacity. I think we’re able to cope with the emergency now, Governor.”

Uhler’s video is in response to a threatening letter he received from the Director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, which states:

I caution you, Kirk, that improvident rhetoric in your missive may jeopardize your county’s access to disaster relief and other funding meant to mitigate the effects of emergencies.

Uhler correctly observes that this is precisely the political strong-arming that should give Attorney General William Barr reason to investigate, because, as these are federal emergency dollars that he is threatening to withhold from American citizens, based upon a County supervisor’s “rhetoric,” this is clearly a violation of the First Amendment.

He also observes the irony in the Governor threatening to withhold disaster funds from his county, while he “just went hat-in-hand to the federal government saying that he and a few other states want one trillion dollars in bailout money.”

Newsom tweets:

NEW: Without federal support, states will be forced to make impossible decisions.

Today – CA, OR, WA, NV, CO, and our legislative leaders have joined together to ask the federal government for $1 trillion to protect our schools, public health, and public safety services.

To be clear, even before this coronavirus pandemic struck, California’s spending promises were a life-threatening problem. Like a junkie needing a fix, California needs money to maintain its spending habit, and it’s willing to do anything to get it. Anyone who can count knows that California is eventually going to need a bailout to keep spending in the manner its leadership has legislated in recent decades, with or without its recent loss of revenue. But to get Congress to provide particularly crippled states, like California, with a trillion-dollar fiscal lifeboat, the economic pain must be tremendous and obvious to everyone.

This is why Newsom is doing everything possible to extend the economic pain in California, and using his goons to strong-arm local authorities that defy his supreme executive power by threatening to withhold federal relief funds that are, apparently, much more efficiently used on paying $500K a month to make sure six recovering Covid patients have an entire sports arena to house their beds.

There is no longer a health emergency that warrants the crippling social and economic measures Newsom has instituted, but the crippling social and economic measures must be extended anyway to maintain perception that the current circumstances amount to a healthcare emergency, which warrants the federal dollars that he seeks to spend.

The Senate Republicans and President Trump should refuse to give in to his spending habit. The Senate should segregate the spending on a state bailout from all other stimulus spending and debate it separately. And if a trillion-dollar bailout somehow passes the Senate, President Trump should refuse to sign it. After all, what would either have to gain by courting these perennial blue states?

Hopefully, the result of this would be that the voters in these blue states hold their leaders accountable for the financial mess they’re in, and maybe then their leaders will have a reason to clean up their fiscal houses, rather than punishing their own citizens with unnecessary and crippling “emergency declarations” in order to get more federal money. But I’m not holding my breath.",fake

Hands reached through open windows and received bags stuffed with goodness. The faces were covered in masks, but you could almost see the smiles behind them.

“Thank you” in several languages could be heard as people accepted the food with gratitude.

One of the appreciative recipients was Pacoima resident Yahaira Fuentes. ” We are very grateful to everyone that are volunteering and giving away to the community,” said the car detailer, who has had almost no work since the stay at home orders were initiated and was happy for the help feeding her family.

Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, chair of the city’s Public Safety Committee, handed out out food and wished people well as they received their bags.

“We have a great deal of need; I think that COVID-19 has daylighted for a lot of families what we knew to be true — that a lot of families are housing and food insecure,” she said. “So we are helping to provide all the resources they need to get through these difficult times.”

As the pandemic moves from public health crisis to partisan flashpoint, the debate over the coronavirus response in the U.S. is becoming increasingly nasty – and, in some cases, violent.

It's not just the clusters of gun-toting protesters at state capitols. In sporadic incidents across the country, disputes over emergency measures have turned into shootings, fistfights and beatings. Stories abound of intimidation over masking. And armed right-wing groups have threatened contact tracers and people who they say ""snitch"" on neighbors and businesses violating health orders.

Researchers who study the links between polarization and violence stress that these incidents are still rare and extreme reactions; polls show that the majority of Americans support and are abiding by distancing measures. But there are fears that the pandemic — especially landing in an election year — has the potential to inflame divisions to dangerous levels if left unchecked.

""If we don't intervene as a nation, as citizens, to begin to correct this identity-based polarization, then the erosion of democratic norms will go even further. And that's the threat of potential social unrest,"" said Tim Phillips, head of the Boston-based nonprofit Beyond Conflict, which tracks polarization and supports peace efforts around the world.

Researchers cite leadership as a key factor in the struggle against polarization. But President Trump draws support through identity politics and has signaled repeatedly that he'll play to his base even in a national health emergency. Take, for example, Trump's refusal to wear a mask despite the advice of his own health authorities and recent coronavirus infections among White House staffers.

Trump has said, with little elaboration, that donning a mask would ""send the wrong message."" Rachel Kleinfeld, who studies polarization and violence at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the president's decision not to wear a mask is calculated.

""Trump recognizes that by talking about masking in a certain way, he can play on an identity,"" Kleinfeld said. ""And it's an identity of virility versus fear, an identity of urban versus rural, an identity of race, even, given who's being hit by the virus, and he can do all those things by triggering something that was not polarizing before, which is whether or not you wear a mask in public.""

Polling shows that masking brings the starkest partisan breakdown of any protective measure: 76% of Democrats say they wear a mask when leaving home, compared with 59% of Republicans, according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Phillips said Beyond Conflict, in conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, will soon release findings that show Americans are indeed polarized, just not as badly as they think. He said news coverage and social media have led to both sides imagining deeper divisions than actually exist — a point to remember, he said, when looking at scenes of pandemic-related violence.

""When we see the armed militia in Michigan, when we see people sort of defying the police — not just mayors and governors — to open up their stores or open up other locations, we tend to think that that's representative of the other side, that they must all think that way,"" Phillips said.

""And yet there's polling in the last two weeks, last week, in the United States that across the Republican-Democratic divide, the majority of Americans recognize that there's a public health crisis and we have to do something about it.""",real

World health officials are increasingly hearing about cases of an inflammatory disease similar to Kawasaki disease in a few countries, including the United States and Italy, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said during a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva.

Doctors and world leaders need ""to be on the alert"" for cases of a rare inflammatory disease in children that may be linked to the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday.

""We need more information collected in a systematic way because with the initial reports, we're getting a description of what this looks like, which is not always the same,"" Kerkhove said. ""And in some children, they tested positive for Covid-19 and other children have not. So we do not know if this is associated with Covid-19.""

Kerkhove said officials raised the alert among the WHO's global clinical network, which is a group of clinicians across the world dealing with Covid-19 patients.

Working with the network, the WHO has developed a preliminary case definition and a case report form for PMIS, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""I call on all clinicians worldwide to work with your national authorities and WHO to be on the alert and better understand this syndrome in children,"" Tedros said.

Early in the outbreak, researchers and infectious disease experts said the virus appeared to be sparing children while hitting the elderly and those with underlying health conditions particularly hard.

Since then, researchers have learned much more about the virus, including that children do get it and can die from it, even without underlying conditions that tend to worsen symptoms. Most kids report mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough and fatigue. However, some children can become seriously ill.

In New York, local health officials are investigating 110 cases of the disease they are calling pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. So far, 16 other states across the U.S. and six European countries are also investigating the disease.

World Health Organization officials said last month that they were investigating whether the coronavirus causes Kawasaki disease in children after several cases cropped up in Europe.

As health officials struggle to find more information about the mysterious illness, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, urged the need to understand the extent of the inflammatory syndrome's association with Covid-19.

""This is a new disease,"" Ryan said. ""When new diseases cross the species' barrier, they very often don't have what you call a primary target organ.""

There have been reports of respiratory syndromes, cardiovascular syndromes and neurological syndromes as a result of a Covid-19 infection because the virus can attack different types of organs, according to Ryan.

He said researchers don't know whether these syndromes, including PMIS, are directly associated with the coronavirus and their attack on human cells or if they're a result of the body's immune response to the virus.

""In many emerging diseases we see both happen,"" Ryan said. ""The virus itself can cause damage and sometimes the immune response to the virus itself can cause damage.""

There's still a lot to learn and uncover on ""what's causing what,"" in order to develop countermeasures and therapies to reduce the impact of this disease in children, he added.",real

Hogue is defending his beliefs after the release of an email in which he requests that only male members of a Christian missionary group say a prayer before a City Council meeting.

The exchange between Hogue and the city’s mayor pro tem, Jeff Forrester, was posted Wednesday on a Facebook page that focuses on the city’s politics.

Forrester emailed Hogue last week about the group, Youth With a Mission, asking for the mayor’s thoughts about arranging for its members to attend the council’s next meeting.

On Sunday, Hogue replied, saying it was a good idea — as long as “those leading the public prayer be young men.”

Wylie Mayor Eric Hogue sent the email to Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Forrester on Sunday. ((custom credit))

Hogue, who also is the minister of Wylie’s Cottonwood Church of Christ, quoted two New Testament verses he said he interprets literally.

The first, 1 Corinthians 14:34-35, says: “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.”

The mayor also quoted a passage from 1 Timothy that says, “Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.”

Hogue wrote that he has always asked for men to lead invocation, while acknowledging that “not everyone may agree with me, but I can’t go against my conscience.”

Hogue did not respond to a request for comment from The Dallas Morning News, but he spoke to local television stations about the email, telling KXAS-TV (NBC5) that his belief extends only to public acts of religion.

“What I will say is a woman can do absolutely anything and everything — but if we’re in a public setting, in a religious setting, the Bible teaches that she’s not to say a public prayer or to lead the singing or to deliver the sermon,” he said.

He reiterated that to WFAA-TV (Channel 8), saying, “I believe a lady can be president of the United States. I believe a lady can be CEO of a company, the superintendent of a school district.” But in the Church of Christ, he said, women don’t lead worship services or singing — only classes for women and children.

Hogue also pointed to his 33-year marriage as a sign of his respect for women.

“My wife would not stick around if I was anti, you know, like that,” he told WFAA. “I mean, we are equal partners in everything.”

Forrester told WFAA he doesn’t share the mayor’s beliefs and was surprised by the email, but he added, “I’ve never observed Mayor Hogue ever speak ill of women.”

Hogue, 56, has been Wylie’s mayor for 12 years and is not seeking re-election this year. In addition to leading the church, he is a professional magician and formerly performed as a clown named Clinky.

Hogue told NBC5 that he suspects the outcry over his email may be motivated by politics after this month’s election was moved to November because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I think the main thing is the budget cycle is coming up, and they would like to have the new council in place,"" he said. “I totally get that, but we are living through a pandemic.”

Investors have been fleeing European and emerging market funds in favor of U.S.-based exchange-traded funds in recent months, with European ETFs seeing record outflows in March amid the volatility.

Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, said that while non-U.S. stock-based ETFs lost roughly $19 billion over the last three months, ""U.S.-targeted strategies"" attracted roughly $57 billion.

""It was really driven by the outflows … out of the European-focused ETFs,"" Bartolini told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" on Monday. ""I think basically what investors are doing here is ostensibly following Warren Buffett's advice and just buying America.""

Buffett has expressed optimism over the U.S. economy's ability to withstand the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, telling Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in a recent virtual meeting that ""Nothing can basically stop America.""

The billionaire investor has long backed U.S. investments as havens in times of crisis, writing in a 2008 op-ed in The New York Times that he had ""been buying American stocks.""

""There's really no preference from investors to express a risk-on view overseas given that the economic and fundamental foundations are not as strong as they are in the U.S.,"" Bartolini said.

And though he acknowledged that ""weak performance, the constructive relative valuations of non-U.S. equity markets and low levels of positioning ... set up international to be a big contrarian call right now,"" Bartolini found one big issue with that strategy.

""Unfortunately, that was the same call for the last few years and it has yet to pan out,"" he said. ""I think if investors do want to sort of step into that market ... firms with higher-quality balance sheets that do trade at inexpensive valuations may be worth a flier just because they might have some more fundamental rigor to withstand any degradation in earnings and economic growth.

The chamber also approved voting by proxy and remote committee work. The rules changes, major moves for a tradition-bound institution, aim to make it easier for representatives to conduct business from outside of Washington during the crisis.

The House passed the rescue legislation in a close 208-199 vote, as Democrats saw defections from both the left and right flanks of the party. Fourteen Democrats voted against the bill and one Republican supported it.

The bill includes:

Nearly $1 trillion for cash-strapped state and local governments

A second round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, with up to $6,000 per household

$200 billion for hazard pay for essential workers

$75 billion for Covid-19 testing efforts

An extension of the $600 per week federal unemployment insurance benefit through January (it is currently set to go through July)

$175 billion in rent, mortgage and utility assistance

A 15% increase in the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit

Repeal of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions for two years, which would help certain states' budget crunch but benefit higher-income taxpayers most

Expanded mail-in ballot access, which Republicans oppose

Relief funds for the U.S. Postal Service

$10 billion in emergency small business disaster assistance grants

Subsidies and a special Affordable Care Act enrollment period for people who lose employer-sponsored health coverage

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he has no interest in taking up the proposal. On Thursday, he said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ""published an 1,800-page seasonal catalog of left-wing oddities and called it a coronavirus relief bill."" The White House threatened to veto the legislation before the House voted.

Pelosi, a California Democrat, has characterized her party's bill as an opening offer in what she hopes will become negotiations with Republicans on another round of fiscal relief. On Friday, she criticized Republicans who said they want to wait to pass more aid.

""Do you think this virus is taking a pause?"" she asked. ""Do you think that the rent takes a pause? Do you think that putting food on the table or the hunger that comes if you can't takes a pause?""

While the president opposed the Democratic plan, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany indicated this week that he would back another relief bill.

Two administration officials told CNBC that the White House would likely support another round of direct payments — a popular piece of the unprecedented emergency spending law passed in March.

McConnell has called for liability protections for doctors and businesses as part of any future legislation the Senate passes. Democrats have generally criticized such a provision.

After Democrats passed the bill Friday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's office told members not to expect votes next week. The House is set to be in session on May 27 and 28.

The pandemic continues to ravage the country. The U.S. now has more than 1.4 million cases, and the disease has killed more than 86,000 Americans, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

More than 36 million people have filed jobless claims since the crisis started.

A federal judge has denied a request from Martin Shkreli — the former pharmaceutical executive widely disdained as ""pharma bro"" — to be released from prison so he can work on a coronavirus treatment.

In her ruling Saturday, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto sided with probation officials who described Shkreli's stated aim of developing a coronavirus cure as the type of ""delusional self-aggrandizing behavior"" that got him his sentence in the first place.

""The court does not find that releasing Mr. Shkreli will protect the public, even though Mr. Shkreli seeks to leverage his experience with pharmaceuticals to help develop a cure for COVID-19 that he would purportedly provide at no cost,"" Matsumoto wrote in the nine-page ruling.

The judge also ruled that Shkreli had failed to demonstrate adequate grounds for release based on compassionate reasons.

""Defendant is a healthy, 37 year old man with no recent history of preexisting medical conditions that place him at higher risk for COVID-19 and its potentially life-threatening adverse effects, and he is confined in a facility where there are currently no cases of COVID-19,"" Matsumoto concluded.

Shkreli entered the public eye in 2015 when, as the then-head of Turing Pharmaceuticals, he purchased the lifesaving HIV drug Daraprim and raised the price from $13.50 a pill to $750 — an increase of more than 5000%. The price-hike quickly cast Shkreli as a combination villain and punchline, the widely-recognized and disliked ""pharma bro.""

Two years later, Shkreli was found guilty of securities fraud stemming from his management of two hedge funds and a separate drug company.

In her ruling, Matsumoto cited the fraud conviction — and Shkreli's public behavior regarding the case — as one of several factors guiding her determination.

""With regard to the nature and circumstances of his offenses, defendant intentionally deceived and manipulated individual and public investors, and before sentencing, made disparaging remarks about the government and the sentencing process that showed little regard for the rule of law,"" the judge said.

Shkreli is currently serving a seven-year sentence.",real

In the age of coronavirus, local officials and NASA are split on whether that’s a good idea.

NASA and SpaceX are urging spectators to stay at home next Wednesday for safety reasons. Officials in Brevard County, home to the Kennedy Space Center, are rolling out the welcome mat in an effort to jump-start a tourism industry hit hard this spring by coronavirus-related lockdowns.

In this Friday, July 8, 2011 file photo, crowds gather in the surf and on the beach in Cocoa Beach, Fla., to watch the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis on STS-135. It was the final U.S. shuttle mission before the fleet was retired. (Photo: Dave Martin, AP)

If people are comfortable coming and watching the launch, “by all means, come. If they aren’t, I respect that too,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

“I’m not going to tell Americans they can’t watch a great piece of history. I’m just not going to do it,” he said.

The sheriff said he is asking visitors to practice social distancing as they watch the launch of astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a test flight of SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT.

Around 85 reserve deputies will be on hand to monitor crowds and ask people to comply with social distancing if they are in groups. A local chain of beach shops is distributing 20,000 masks to spectators in coordination with the sheriff’s office, Ivey said.

The sheriff, who grew up in Florida watching launches, wants a new generation to be able to experience the energy, excitement and feelings of patriotism that comes from watching a U.S. launch with astronauts.

“NASA is a true part of our history in Brevard County,” Ivey said.

Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine asked potential spectators to watch the launch online or on TV from home. The space agency is also offering a “virtual launch experience.”

NASA is doing its best to facilitate social distancing inside the Kennedy Space Center by limiting access, although it may be hosting two VIPS. Vice President Mike Pence says he plans to be there, and President Donald Trump said he’s thinking of attending.

The visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for viewing launches, is closed to the public.

NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. It will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit for the space agency.

“The challenge that we’re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,” Bridenstine said. “And so we’re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.”.

Although crowd sizes varied, a high-profile space shuttle launch could attract a half million visitors to the Space Coast. Local tourism officials think next week’s launch will bring in no more than 200,000 spectators.

With airline passenger traffic drastically down and nearby Orlando theme parks closed because of the pandemic, “we’re not going to be getting the out-of-state traffic we may have gotten during the shuttle era,” said Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.

“The environment is different with COVID and people now reemerging from stay-at-home orders,” Cranis said. “There are going to be a number of people who are hesitant.”

The Space Coast’s tourism business is down by about 40% for the year, and that could cost the area $1 billion, he said.

“A launch like this after a big long weekend could really give us a shot in the arm,” Cranis said.

Local hoteliers are looking forward to the influx of visitors after two bad months. Tom Williamson, who is general manager of two hotels on the Space Coast, each with 150 rooms or more, said one hotel was closed and the other only had 15% occupancy in April. He expects both hotels to be at or near capacity on the night of the launch.

“We’re glad to seem some signs of life,” Williamson said.

Steven Giraldo works as a technical consultant for a software company in St. Petersburg, Florida, but he has a side gig with some space-buff friends offering charter boat tours for watching launches. For next week’s SpaceX launch, he had booked around 150 people from as far away as Australia for $75 a head on a fleet of boats. He ended up scrapping those plans.

“It would take too much logistical effort to see if everyone is wearing a mask, making sure no one has a fever, and how to you social distance on a boat?” Giraldo said.

Instead, he plans to watch the launch with seven other friends, some from Arizona and Indiana, in a boat on the Banana River.

“This was going to be our biggest event. The historical significance of it created a lot of buzz,” Giraldo said. “But I just don’t know how we could have done it.”

Crystal Cox/Business Insider

1. Which investments would you call under-the-radar opportunities right now?

Many investors, whether they are pension funds or retirees, need income.

And bonds, which used to be the cornerstone of an income-generating portfolio, just aren't delivering unless you venture out on the risk spectrum.

One can generate a much higher level of income today from a portfolio on high-quality dividend paying stocks. And unlike bond coupons, dividends from stocks can grow over time.

2. What is your most contrarian, or surprising, market call in this environment?

We are seeing pressure on companies to halt buybacks and dividend payments, and some will be forced to do just that, especially if they benefit from government assistance.

But dividends are an important part of thoughtful capital allocation. If a company has excess cash that it has no place to invest for a return above its cost of capital, it's prudent to return that capital to shareholders. Otherwise, they are destroying value.

Our view is that well-managed companies will not abandon sound capital allocation policies. While they may temporarily suspend buybacks, those with strong balance sheets and ongoing cash flows will continue paying dividends.

3. Name one stock or investment you're most bullish on right now.

Our approach is not to find some rare gem with undiscovered value. We look for a diversified group of stocks where we have a high degree of confidence they will pay and grow dividends.

Here's one of them: Watsco, the largest distributor of air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment and related parts and supplies in North America. It has a history of returning cash to shareholders, having paid a quarterly dividend since 2009.

They are also making significant investments in technology. A lot of companies are talking about ecommerce and mobile apps; however, most investors don't associate technology with HVAC equipment distributors.

4. What is one risk within the market you feel investors are missing?

In a time like this, active management is essential for an income-oriented equity portfolio.

Companies that have been buying back shares and paying dividends while piling up debt are in for a rough period. For a portfolio to provide sustained income, companies need to be vetted for the ability to pay dividends that are covered by sustainable and growing cash flows, and for shareholder-friendly management.",real

“These business realities have forced the gut-wrenching decision that the Tribe has tried to avoid since the beginning of this pandemic: we have implemented furloughs and lay-offs for the first time in our 34-year history,” the release stated. “Those impacted have been notified and we are supporting them in navigating unemployment insurance, providing outplacement services, and assisting them in exploring opportunities with us in newly created positions including Social Distancing Ambassadors and Safety Concierges.”

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Ken Ramirez, tribal chair for the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, said tribal officials looked at other alternatives before having to lay off some of the casino’s team members and those included organization-wide pay reductions, eliminating nonessential expenses and delaying construction on San Manuel’s casino expansion and other capital projects.

Latisha Casas, treasurer for the San Manuel Band, said in the video that business could be impacted for some time.

“We are going to have to reopen in phases and we believe that demand from customers is going to take some time to come back,” Casas said. “So realistically, we could be over a year from meaningful recovery and in the meantime we’ll be operating a much smaller business.”

In anticipation of a possible June opening, the casino’s leadership will begin to recall team members to their positions. The release says those team members will have to be certified in the casino’s COVID-19 Health and Safety Training Program before they return to work.

In an email, Public Relations Manager Jenna Brady said it is unclear how many employees will be affected by furloughs and layoffs because casino officials don’t know how many team members will return to work, how many will attend the mandatory coronavirus training and how many will accept other roles within the organization, but said initial conversations concluded the casino would bring back the “the great majority of our workforce.”

Brady said that for employees who have been laid off, the casino is assisting with unemployment insurance, outplacement and connecting with other hiring organizations. It has established an assistance hotline and it will also work with laid-off workers to see if it can move them into newly created positions.

San Manuel, which closed March 15, has extended its closure as other casinos in the region have begun to reopen.

756,910,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/melatonin-could-possibly-play-immune-modulating-role-against-covid-19/,2020-05-14,Melatonin Could Possibly Play An Immune Modulating Role Against COVID-19,"A recent review suggests that melatonin may play a role in combating COVID-19 as an adjuvant therapy; excessive inflammation, oxidation, and exaggerated immune responses during infection contributes to the cytokine storm that progresses into acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome and the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating effects of melatonin have been shown to be protective against viral induced ALI and ARDS. (1)

Research indicates nucleotide similarity between SARS-COVs, MERS-CoVs and SARS-CoV02 which suggests a high genetic homology. With infection severe inflammatory and immune response may activate a cytokine storm such as apoptosis of epithelial cells and endothelial cells leading to vascular leakage and abnormal T-cell and macrophage responses that could induce ALI/ARDS and even death. This storm appears to be prevalent in those with COVID-19 based on genetic homology and pathologic features of infected lungs, and in the blood there is a marked increase of inflammatory markers IL-1B, IFN-y, IP-10, MCp-1, IL-4 and Il-10. Those with COVID-19 also present with suppressed immune function that is marked by hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and a decreased percentage of CD8+ T-cells. The excessive inflammation, depressed immunity, and cytokine storm appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. (1,2,3,6)

Due to the antiviral, antioxidant, and immune enhancing properties melatonin has been shown to help reduce viremia, paralysis, and death in mice infected with encephalitis and it has led to the downregulation of acute lung oxidative injury, proinflammatory cytokine release and inflammatory cell recruitment in respiratory syncytial virus models. Findings support possible use of melatonin in treatment of viral diseases, additionally the actions of melatonin support has potential attenuation for COVID-19 infection.(1,4,5)

The anti-inflammatory effects are exerted through various pathways such as suppressing NF-kB activation in ARDS and downregulating NF-kN activation in T-cells and lung tissues. It also stimulates NF-E3 related factor 2 which is important in protecting against lung, liver, and cardiovascular injury. Melatonin has been shown to help reduce production of the cytokines and chemokines TNF-a, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 which are involved in inflammation. (1,9,10,11)

NLRP3 is part of the innate immune response during lung infection that is activated by viruses to amplify inflammation. It is correlated to lung disease caused by infection and melatonin has been shown to be efficacious at inhibiting NLRP3 mediated lung injury by reducing inflammation of macrophages and neutrophils in lung tissues. (1,7,8)

Melatonin enhances immune response by improving proliferation and maturation of natural killer cells, T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes; in macrophages antigen presentation is augmented after the application of melatonin including the upregulation of complement receptor 3, MHC class I and class II, as well as CD4 antigens.

Although there are no studies related to the use of melatonin in the treatment of COVID-19 its use has been shown to be promising in other diseases with increased levels of inflammation. Doses of 5 mg/d and 25 mg/d have been shown to decrease serum levels of IL-6, TBF-a, and hs-C reactive protein in those with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, as well as promoting reductions in serum concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1B and lipoproteins with MS. Melatonin intake of 5-10 mg/d has also been shown to decrease many of the same inflammatory cytokines that are being seen in COVID-19. (1,13,14,15)

Even at higher doses the short term use of melatonin has been deemed safe, but while their safety has been verified in human studies its effects when given to those with COVID-19 remains unknown and should be monitored closely.

Animal models and human studies have continuously documented the efficacy and safety of melatonin. Those with viral infection or those dealing with inflammation based chronic conditions possible may benefit from melatonin. Thus melatonin testing could reveal the baseline status of this anti-inflammatory and immune modulating hormone to provide a framework for its supplementation.",fake

Google & Apple COVID-Tracing Tech Sparks Security Concerns,"Rival tech giants Google and Apple have now come together to release long-anticipated software that will help states build phone apps to trace an individual’s exposure to coronavirus. However, there are many things at stake in this initiative.

A number of state officials from North Dakota, South Carolina and Alabama publicly praised an unprecedented collaboration between Google and Apple that will help them produce a contact-tracing app automatically notifying people whether they have spent time near someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

These US states and some countries have already signalled that they will be willing to use the app, while France, Norway and India have remained sceptical regarding the initiative, giving preference to a more centralised approach, that allows the storing up and uploading of data via Bluetooth to a remote server, thus allegedly making it easier for health authorities to contain the virus.

So far, the UK’s NHS has been developing a contact tracing app built exactly using this approach, despite breach of privacy concerns and the possibility that this data will b overshared with the government. According to some reports, Britain is now also eyeing the integration of an Apple-Google API model to their app, but some fear that even a decentralised approach propelled by these two giants may not be as safe as initially suggested.

“It is possible this technology may be abused to collect more information other than data related to the virus,” says Fow Chee Kang, associate director and cyber security managing consultant at LGMS. “Although the statement released by the tech giants highlights the features of protecting user privacy and security, nevertheless, there are still possibilities of using such technology in conjunction with existing data that is already in the mobile device to profile the user.”

The companies have indeed stated that the version of their COVID-tracing app would protect its users with the help of encryption, and lack a centralised database, with the process being carried out only through the phones themselves, which would prevent the unnecessary storage of private information. However, following several scandals involving Google over potential breaches of privacy, the company has openly stated its cooperation with the White House “may negatively impact the trust of users” toward Apple as well, says Kang.

“It is certain that there will be data being shared to the government about its user, hence, it may affect the trust of Apple customers in this sense,” the expert notes.

According to Matthew Hickey, cyber security expert and co-founder of Hacker House, contact tracing applications as such “have been disputed by many as an unnecessary invasion of privacy,” as he argues that even the creators of NHS’s app “have expressly stated that they wish to retain the collected data after the pandemic ends for future study”.

“This opens up the prospect that this data could also be abused in the future and will make it easier for similar track and trace programs to be implemented by governments around the world,” Hickey argues. “It is my opinion that we should not sacrifice our personal privacy and liberty for a small amount of security from a Virus threat.”

There still might be an option for those users who are “concerned about the privacy and security of any information collected from smartphone tracing apps”, says associate professor at the School of Engineering at RMIT Mark A Gregory, which is “to factory reset their phones after the pandemic.” He does not specify, however, how to go about information that has already been collected by Google and Apple about its users.

Fear of the outbreaks already led to a drop in passenger demand in January, according to the industry group International Air Transport Association (IATA), which called it “just the tip of the iceberg.” Airlines continue to drastically cut flights as more people decide not to fly during the outbreak. Airlines could continue to see between an 11 and 19 percent loss in global passenger revenues through the end of the year, IATA projects.

“just the tip of the iceberg”

That dip in travel means less pollution from planes. Aviation currently accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that number was expected to grow through 2050. Now, as both business and leisure travel get curtailed, airlines are facing a near future that is both cleaner and economically leaner.

“The turn of events as a result of COVID-19 is almost without precedent. In little over two months, the industry’s prospects in much of the world have taken a dramatic turn for the worse,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA director general and CEO said in a statement last week. “This is a crisis.”

This particular crisis is leading to an environmental backlash from some airlines. IATA and airlines including Air France-KLM have called for relief from environmental taxes in Europe. There are also concerns about how decreased air travel this year could affect standards for mandatory carbon offsets that go into effect next year.

The fate of those carbon offsets — which will affect international flights — is expected to be determined this week as the United Nations’ aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), meets in Montreal. The body adopted a measure requiring airlines to offset their growth in carbon emissions from international flights between more than 190 countries starting in 2021. To meet that requirement, airlines need to spend money on renewable energy or tree-planting projects that help keep heat-trapping gases out of the atmosphere. Back in 2016, ICAO decided to cap aviation emissions at the average of 2019-2020 levels. But thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower than any of the airlines expected. In order to keep their future emissions in line, airlines will need to funnel significantly more money into green projects to offset their excess emissions.

thanks to the novel coronavirus outbreaks, this year’s baseline will be way lower

Some environmentalists worry that facing this increased pressure, airlines may backtrack on their climate pledges or push for more lax standards on the quality of carbon offsets they’re allowed to purchase. Environmental groups expect a decision on which carbon offset credits airlines are allowed to buy to come out of the Montreal meeting on Friday. “The sector is aware that while it has to deal with the very near-term disaster of coronavirus which is a huge public health issue with very important and very sad consequences for communities, it also has to keep its eye on the ball of the long term climate issue — which is not going away,” says Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund.

A spokesperson for IATA told The Verge in an email that it was too soon to comment on the full impact of COVID-19 on the industry. ICAO responded in an email that it used two years to set its baseline for capping emissions — 2019 and 2020 — in order to address any “exceptional events” (like the spread of the novel coronavirus) that might skew data.

Aviation has typically rebounded after big global shocks like the SARS outbreak in 2002, which is why environmental groups are keeping the pressure on airlines to fulfill their long-term climate pledges even if it costs them more money in the short run.",real
775,117,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/andrew-yangs-nonprofit-to-donate-1-million-to-families-impacted-by-coronavirus/,2020-03-20,Andrew Yang's nonprofit to donate $1 million to families impacted by coronavirus,"Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang's brand-new nonprofit plans to contribute more than $1 million to working families impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak in New York City and across the country, the group announced Friday.

The Humanity Forward Fund, a nonprofit founded by Yang after he suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, will begin sending $1,000 over the next couple of weeks to 1,000 households in New York City's Bronx borough.

""We figured out very quickly that people are going to need money immediately. And our government should do this,"" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. ""[This fund] exists to demonstrate the power of these ideas, so we started giving money out immediately.""

Yang is no stranger to cash stipends. Before the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., Yang, then a presidential candidate, proposed granting every adult American monthly payments of $1,000, turning the concept of ""Universal Basic Income"" into a household name, for many. His presidential campaign launched a ""Freedom Dividend Pilot Program"" to test and promote his signature policy, in December 2019.

Yet distributing cash fast to 1,000 households brought to light larger logistical problems amid CDC-mandated social distancing. ""It actually took us a little while to figure out how we could give that money effectively to people in the Bronx who needed it,"" Yang said. ""The tricky thing is actually trying to get money to people who need it at a time when you know you shouldn't be knocking on doors.""

While the former presidential candidate initially reached out to Citigroup and J.P. Morgan for assistance, privacy regulations prevented the entrepreneur from partnering with banks. Ultimately, the nonprofit teamed up with Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners and the Collective Education PAC to distribute stipends, targeting struggling families as businesses furlough hourly employees, faced with the spread of COVID-19.

The group will also work hand in hand with One Fair Wage (OFW), contributing to the ""Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund"" to benefit service workers across New York City who are stifled by the economic shutdown.

""With the closing of all of the bars and restaurants, and now, essentially nail salons and gyms and everything else, New York has tens, even hundreds of thousands of service workers who now don't have a source of income,"" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. ""And New York is also the most densely populated city in our country. So if there's any place you would want people to have the ability to stay home, not have to worry about where their next grocery money or rent check is going to come from, it would be in New York, in a place like the Bronx.""

In an effort to inspire more awareness and giving online, the fund has also pledged $100,000 in micro-grants of $250 or $500 distributed directly via social media networks – Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. ""Clearly, if your neighbor is struggling, you should help them. But the truth is that some people will be on social media an awful lot because we're all trapped at home,"" Yang conceded. ""And so if you can find a way for someone to be engaged that's actually productive via social media, either to get help or give help, that struck us as very positive.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Friday for bipartisan agreement on the mounting stimulus package that could push $1 trillion and include direct payments to U.S. households reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yang tweeted Tuesday that his team ""has been in touch with the White House"" and is offering up further resources. The former presidential candidate says while he's thrilled ""common sense is prevailing,"" there will be no victory lap. Yang has encouraged lawmakers to think beyond one-time payments to families hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. ""To me, we don't know how long this crisis is going to continue. You want people to have confidence that their family is going to be okay, even if this crisis drags on for a while,"" Yang told CBS News. ""So instead of one check you should be looking at regular checks once a month or even more frequent, so that we have our basic needs met, even if this does drag on for quite some time.""

Despite dropping out of the race, Yang – who endorsed Joe Biden earlier this month — predicts monthly payments to American families will be ""a major topic"" in the upcoming presidential election and legislative sessions. ""I think both parties are going to be embracing it to a much higher degree. And I believe it's going to end up passing here in the United States in the next number of months,"" he said.

Hunkered down in his own home in New York, Yang expresses remorse in hearing the personal stories of former campaign staff, friends and neighbors, isolated by quarantine and social distancing. ""I am deeply concerned that this pandemic is going to cut us off from each other at a time when what we need is actually the ability to help each other,"" Yang said. ""And certainly I'm doing everything I can to help by sending money digitally, but that is not what most people need. Most people need things in person and face to face. That's the way we're wired as people. And so I think it's very hard to see a silver lining in this crisis.""

779,1899,https://www.rt.com/usa/489592-rick-scott-china-cold-war/,2020-05-23,‘NO QUESTION’ US in COLD WAR 2 with China – Florida senator,"The US is “absolutely” engaged in a new Cold War with China, Florida Senator Rick Scott declared, accusing Beijing of plotting “world domination.” Meanwhile, Washington’s anti-China stance goes all the way to the White House.

Speaking to talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday, the Florida Republican slammed Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and its economic policies. Asked whether relations between the two superpowers had entered a “Cold War 2” phase, Scott replied “absolutely.”

“There’s no question about it,” he said. “They’re in for world domination. They take our jobs, they take our technology, they put people in prison for their religion.”

“Understand you have an enemy,” he continued. “They’re an adversary. It’s called Communist China. They’re not here to help us, all right?”

Scott called Beijing’s decision not to alert the World Health Organization about the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan until January “intentional,” and suggested a boycott of Chinese-made products until the east Asian superpower is held “accountable.”

The Floridian lawmaker, who sits on the Senate’s Armed Services and Homeland Security committees, then called for the US to sanction China “for violating Hong Kong’s independence."" China, on the other hand, has accused the US of deliberately stoking protest in the semi-autonomous city-state.

Scott’s anti-China broadsides are not the musings of a single Republican war-hawk. Instead, they represent a growing consensus in the US, with bills threatening Beijing with sanctions being introduced and a number of Republican saying they will sue the Chinese administration for its alleged role in the coronavirus pandemic. That’s as President Donald Trump has been raging at China throughout the pandemic, suggesting that Covid-19 was cooked up in a Chinese laboratory, and threatening to “cut off the whole relationship” with Beijing.

Trump’s outburst was likely hyperbolic, but the official line coming from the White House is equally uncompromising. In a policy document outlining its strategic approach to China, the White House this week revealed a “fundamental re-evaluation of how the United States understands and responds to the leaders of the world’s most populous country.”

Accusing China of “predatory economic practices” and “malign behaviors” that undermine national security, the document stated that the US is now engaged in “long-term strategic competition” with Beijing, and will orient its military toward this competition, and toward supporting its “regional allies and partners” in the Pacific. And all of this on top of the Pentagon prioritizing China as an adversary in 2018.

Beijing’s responses, meanwhile, have been subtler. In Hong Kong, it has sought to portray the US as meddling in its affairs, and the conflict between protesters and mainland authorities as an internal matter. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, China has threatened to respond with “painful” countermeasures if Congress applies sanctions or files lawsuits. Globally, as the US continues to deal with more than a million active cases of Covid-19, China has gone on a charm offensive, shipping test kits and protective equipment to the worst-hit countries in Europe.

Militarily though, Beijing continues to pump money into hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence research – two areas in which it has the edge on America. Its navy has also not been deterred by American patrols in the South China Sea, and continues to assert sovereignty over this hotly disputed tract of water.

Because this flight is launching during a pandemic, tighter restrictions and protocols are in place to prevent the novel coronavirus from making its way to space.

The three people headed to orbit Thursday include NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner. Ivanishin and Vagner are last-minute replacements to the flight after one of the original cosmonauts assigned to the mission suffered an eye injury. For Cassidy and Ivanishin, this will be their third trip to orbit, while it will be the first for Vagner. The crew will stay on the ISS for a total of six months.

Final preparations for a trip to the space station from Russia usually begin in Star City — a small town just outside of Moscow. After a brief stay, the crew then heads to Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where their rocket launches, and enters a two-week quarantine period. Even before the pandemic, NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, required crews to enter a two-week quarantine ahead of their launch date, to ensure the travelers don’t inadvertently carry a nasty bug to space.

“We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.”

However, quarantine procedures accelerated slightly while the crews were still in Star City. Around the time of Cassidy’s arrival at the beginning of March, stricter travel restrictions and social distancing measures were enacted all over the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“Had I been in normal quarantine, I probably could have gone out to some restaurants and left the immediate parameters of the Star City area and just been smart about where we went,” Cassidy said during a round of press interviews on March 19th. “But not this time. We’ve been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential place to go to get food.”

Pavel Vlasov, head of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, confirmed that the crews started quarantining earlier than usual. “They do not go on any trips even the traditional like visiting the Kremlin wall and [Sergei] Korolev’s house before setting off to Baikonur,” Vlasov said in a statement on the Roscosmos website.

Cassidy has since traveled to Baikonur Cosmodrome and gone through the regular quarantine procedures. NASA maintains that its employees have been following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for controlling infections ahead of quarantine, “such as cleaning of surfaces, social distancing, emphasizing hand hygiene, encouraging NASA team members who are sick to stay home and limiting contact with crew members,” according to a NASA spokesperson. Meanwhile, Cassidy and his crewmates have stayed relatively isolated in their hotel, prepping for the mission, exercising, and even playing ping-pong. “Ironically, the timing of our entering the strict quarantine protocol somewhat magically lined up with the world caving in, in terms of quarantine protocol,” Cassidy said.

But come launch day, the sights and sounds leading up to the mission will be much quieter than usual. Roscosmos has banned all media from covering the launch in person, and there will be fewer people on site to cheer the astronauts as they head to the rocket. “Normally as you come walking out of the hotel... there’s music playing and there’s crowds of people lining the walkway as we proceed from the hotel to the buses, and it’s very, very motivating. It’s super exciting,” Cassidy said. But those celebrations will be absent this time around. “It’ll be completely quiet. There won’t be anybody there. We’ll just kind of walk out. Maybe we’ll still play the music and fire the three of us up ourselves. But who knows?”

“I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem.”

None of Cassidy’s family or friends can be at the launch due to travel restrictions. His wife was able to be with him while in Star City, and she had planned to attend the launch. But after Russia restricted foreign travel on March 16th, her itinerary changed. Ultimately, she went home when he headed to Baikonur Cosmodrome. “We thought we would say goodbye on launch day,” Cassidy said.

Despite everything, Cassidy is feeling good ahead of launch. He even shared a rap his friend made on Instagram about how to stay at home to fight COVID-19. He hopes that all of the extra precautions were enough to prevent COVID-19’s spread to space. “I really haven’t been around anybody else, so it’d be really, really strange if I did contract something,” Cassidy said on March 19th. “Anything can happen between now and April 9th, but we’re being really super vigilant so that I can remain healthy to get to the station.”

While on board the ISS, the crew will conduct science experiments and maybe even go on some spacewalks down the line. If all goes according to plan, this crew will likely be an audience to this summer’s most anticipated spaceflight event: the arrival of the first crewed flight of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The vehicle, developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, is slated to take off this May, carrying NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to the space station. But while there’s plenty to look forward to in space, Cassidy said his mind won’t stray far from what’s happening on the Earth below.

“I’ll have a full plate and my mind will be engaged, but I’m still going to be talking, communicating, emailing with my family and loved ones and friends,” Cassidy said. “I certainly am not going to be disengaged from it thinking it’s not my problem. It’s certainly my problem, because my family is living it and my friends and my co-workers are living it in real time.”

Takeoff for the mission is slated for 4:05AM ET on April 9th. After launch, the crew will make four orbits around Earth and arrive at the International Space Station six hours later. NASA’s coverage of the launch will begin at 3AM ET, and coverage of docking will begin at 9:30AM ET.",real

Fran Tirado is producing queer content and only queer content. “I’m just so uninterested in making anything that is not for queer-trans audiences,” he said.
At Netflix, his job title is brand and editorial strategy lead for L.G.B.T.Q. content. That means developing concepts for shows like “I Like to Watch,” in which two drag queens watch and talk about Netflix programming; working with a group of content creators for the company’s @Most social channel; and  keeps tabs on the promotional campaigns for shows and movies. He also has a podcast, “Food 4 Thot,” about “sex, identity, culture, what we like to read and who we like to read.”
Mx. Tirado — who previously worked in magazines as the deputy editor of Out and the executive editor of the now-defunct Hello Mr. — once split his time between New York and Los Angeles, but is riding out the coronavirus pandemic on the West Coast. “Trying to fabricate a kind of intimacy digitally with talent, and with our content, is tough,” he said.
“Queer and marginalized people are historically resilient and have a proven track record of thriving in the face of adversity, pandemic and crisis,” Mx. Tirado added. “I know that we will come out of this thing stronger than ever, and it will be the most marginalized that lead the charge on creative ways we used our time and produced digitally despite it all.
“We’ve already seen so much of it, and it’s just going to get better.”
Monday6:45 a.m. Getting up has been difficult. Normally I’m awake a little earlier, but only to go to a 7 a.m. exercise class down the street, where I pay so that hot Australians can yell at me while I do circuit training. That gym is obviously closed, so I lie in bed like a swollen burrito. Diana Ross’s “It’s My House” is the alarm blasting from my Google Home, and it jeers with irony.
7:20 a.m. Part of my quarantine mania has manifested in an increasingly elaborate skin care routine.7:40 a.m. I stay in my pajamas, turn off my phone and start writing for a completely uninterrupted time, a ritual I started for quarantine and definitely was not disciplined enough to do before.
I’m working on my own TV pilot and a feature, joining the ranks of every other clichéd gay in Los Angeles. This week, I’m working only on the feature — a gay wedding rom-com I had the idea for when I was 19. I heat up a piece of coconut chocolate-chip banana bread I made and spread cream cheese and blackberries on it.
9:40 a.m. I prep for the day’s meetings and get dressed for work, which is one of the primary things I do to stay not-depressed. I Slack my agency to make sure a trailer debut is going up on time for “Circus of Books,” a Ryan Murphy documentary about a historic gay pornography shop that is on the same block as my apartment. I literally get to talk about gay porn as my job, like, what is life?
10 a.m. Weekly meeting with the writers in New York who run our L.G.B.T.Q. social channel, @Most. We talk through some key beats, titles and moments planned for the days ahead.
11 a.m. Meeting with the entire editorial team. I’m delighted to report that my new at-home office setup has the prettiest window light ever for videoconferencing.
Noon Catch-up with the team running Ryan Murphy projects to talk through production updates.1 p.m. Finally catch a break and eat a smoothie for lunch (insufferable).
2 p.m. Meeting with my core team — a group of people who do the same job as me for other marginalized audiences.
3:30 p.m. At this point, my brain is leaving with or without me. I chug a matcha and a protein bar to try to power through an hour of absolutely zombied emailing. I’m working on two more project announcements and three premieres. I also sent some emails about this weekend’s recording of my podcast.
6 p.m. Working out at home is the most difficult part of my day, largely because it’s very hard for me to do exercise without someone yelling at me. I paid my trainer to give me daily workout regimens at home, and he checks in with me. Today is upper body, and I hate every moment of it.
7 p.m. FaceTime my partner. He’s in New York for work, and it’s hard for me to talk about. We’ve been FaceTiming most days until he can come back to L.A., hopefully within a month.
11:30 p.m. I am too high to do my nighttime skin care route. Time for bed!Tuesday6:50 a.m. Cold brew, skin care, gay music. I am the proud owner of 41,939 overpriced candles, so I light one to get going.
10 a.m. I listen to “Still Processing,” the only podcast I never miss. Today’s episode was a salient critique on Netflix’s “Tiger King,” all of which I agree with.
10:25 a.m. I’ve run out of sticky notes. I throw on some day clothes and hop into my first meeting of the day, talking through new plans for Netflix’s Pride initiative. Luckily, only one component of our campaign has been disrupted by the virus.
Noon Go out for a walk to get some Post-its. I FaceTime my partner on the way. On the way back, I FaceTime a friend who lives down the street to consult on a queer music project he’s working on.
4 p.m. Call a friend in New Orleans who needs help with a podcast project. As you can tell, I do a lot of free business and marketing consulting for friends. I don’t mind doing it, so long as it’s for queer and trans people.
7:15 p.m. After showering, it’s time to make a tomato galette. I have perfected the flaky basic pastry after almost a decade of practice. (I used to be obsessed with making pies, after my first viewing of “Waitress.”)
7:30 p.m. My friends who run WNYC’s “Nancy” podcast text me about co-hosting the premiere of “The Half of It,” a wonderful queer Asian coming-of-age film we have coming out.
9:20 p.m. I’ve been watching TV every night of quarantine, and I am at peace with that. My promise to myself is to watch only new things I haven’t seen before, so my brain remains active.
When I watch pilots or films, I take out a sheet of paper and write out the script’s beats to learn how they are written. I’ve just started “The Good Fight” and am addicted in an unprecedented way.
9:50 p.m. Late dinner. I drizzle olive oil and add salt, pepper and fresh basil onto this bad boy. (The galette.) The edible has hit, a triumph.
Wednesday7:20 a.m. Up late. I have a standing very early meeting on Wednesdays with folks on the East Coast. I brush my teeth and throw on some terrible clothes, logging on just in time with cold brew in hand.
11:30 a.m. I’m realizing today is on fire and I will not get time to myself to write. I take a selfie and send to Twitter to validate.
1:30 p.m. Call with a writer to debrief on a script he’s working on about the history of gay porn.2:30 p.m. Meeting for the debut of Ryan Murphy’s “Hollywood” — we discuss digital premiere possibilities.
3 p.m. Weekly task force to discuss the upcoming season of “Queer Eye.”3:30 p.m. Call with New York magazine — they’re working on a coffee-table book, and I’m contributing a “queer guide” to the city. I miss New York.
6 p.m. After a bunch of emailing, I’m supposed to do my workout, but I truly cannot find the strength. Somebody said something about a burger earlier today, and now all I can think is burger, burger, burger. Time for a grocery run.
9 p.m. I’m a little confused by “Mrs. America” on FX, but I would do anything for Cate Blanchett. The burger is so good that I go and make another burger, this time with an egg (please do not judge me).
I switch to HBO’s “Run” because the first episode is free on YouTube. Fall asleep watching “The Good Fight.”
Thursday6:45 a.m. Our chief executive is doing an early-morning Q. and A., but I skip it to write.9:52 a.m. I’ve finished another breakfast sandwich just in time to log into a town hall of sorts with the C.E.O. of Glaad and listen to her talk about how L.G.B.T.Q.+ communities have been coping with Covid-19.
10:30 a.m. Fairly light schedule today: a meeting for the “Queer Eye” trailer, a “Circus of Books” premiere and a weekly catch-up with my boss.
5:25 p.m. Today got busy, with asks left and right, as well as some script editing. I’m now 25 minutes late to game night with my chosen family, who are all playing on Zoom without me. To be honest, I hate games. But I am so happy to see their faces and share space with them. We play for two hours, and it’s actually quite fun.

We are talking about billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates, of course, who reportedly offered a $10 million bribe to the Nigerian House of Representatives in exchange for gaining access to Nigerian children whom he could experiment on with a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

All the House had to do was pass a bill presented by Gates that would have mandated the vaccination of all Nigerians with an experimental Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine created by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its drug partners.

Thankfully, opposition political parties quickly rejected this proposed eugenics and possible genocide attempt, and even threatened the Speaker of the House with impeachment if he agreed to Gates’ bribe.

It was the Nigerian Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) that says it intercepted a human intelligence report detailing how the Nigerian House of Representatives was right on the verge of selling out its people when the scheme was unearthed, bringing it to a halt.

The House was not only poised to pass the Gates bill, but it was planning to do so outside the bounds of the traditional legislative process.

In other words, it was a back-door deal done under the cover of darkness to advance the vaccination dreams of Bill Gates.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, unpacks the plan to depopulate the world, in part through mass vaccination:

Is Bill Gates Satan in the flesh?

In a statement, opposition spokesman Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere chastised the House for even considering accepting Gates’ offer, no matter the sum of money.

He further threatened to unseat Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila for his complicity in the horrific plot.

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered,” that statement reads.

“This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill.”

Great Game India reports that the alleged deal to secretly and illegally pass this sellout bill was hatched during a legislative trip to Austria a few months back.

The financial boost was later added to get the bill moving more quickly, and to get it passed by any means necessary.

“Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/ approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none,” Great Game India further adds about how a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine does not even exist.

Meanwhile, Sara Cunial, a prominent Italian politician, has spoken out calling for the arrest of Bill Gates.

She says that he is a “vaccine criminal” who needs to be handed over to the International Criminal Court to be tried for his many crimes against humanity.

Cunial also played a critical role in exposing Gates’ genocidal efforts in India and other countries throughout Africa, which include plans to use vaccinations to deliver microchips into people’s bodies as part of his nefarious ID2020 program.

Among the Chicago-area companies to benefit, records show, were:

A railcar manufacturer — which secured the maximum $10 million — that closed a factory in Virginia last year and opened a new one in Mexico while paying its CEO $2.1 million in total compensation.

A clean-energy company in Cicero that told shareholders when it announced its $9.5 million loan that COVID-19 hadn’t harmed its business.

Two companies that employ thousands of workers — well over the program’s usual 500-employee limit, though businesses also can qualify based on net worth or net income.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this past week that the rules that had allowed publicly traded corporations and other big companies to quickly deplete the initial $349 billion pot — shutting out many mom-and-pop operations — needed tightening. He warned publicly held companies that got more than $2 million through the coronavirus stimulus program that they would be audited. And he has asked large enterprises to voluntarily give back the money or possiblly face criminal charges if found to have cheated.

The U.S. Small Business Administration, which is overseeing the program, requires that “borrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary,” taking into account access to cash and credit. “For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,” the Trump administration said April 23.

The SBA won’t disclose who got the bailout money. But some large national franchises have said they’ll give back the money they got after reports disclosed that. Among them: Potbelly, the Chicago-based sandwich giant.

The loans were part of a $2 trillion coronavirus-relief package Congress passed in March. In part, they were to cover fixed costs like rent and utilities, but the bulk of the money for companies under 500 workers was to keep people on the payroll. Another $321 billion has since been added to the program.

Illinois businesses, including the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times, secured about 69,000 loans through April 16 totaling $15.9 billion, according to SBA data.

Eight publicly traded companies in Illinois have disclosed their participation. Altogether, they‘ve collected more than $38 million in the low-interest loans:

FreightCar International, a Chicago manufacturer of rail cars, received the maximum $10 million on April 16. The president of the company, which has 496 employees, was in line in 2019 for $2.1 million in total compensation, including a $750,000 bonus, according to its filings with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.

That same year, as it reported $229.9 million in revenue and a net loss of $75.2 million, the company closed a plant in Virginia, then leased a manufacturing facility in Mexico that’s set to open later this year. FreightCar also eliminated medical and vision insurance for retirees and their dependents as of Jan 1, telling shareholders that saved $6.6 million.

Company representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

Broadwind Energy, a Cicero manufacturer of clean-energy equipment, received $9.5 million even as it reported earlier in April that it had $12.5 million in available credit and nearly as much in cash.

“We did not experience significant impacts from the novel coronavirus disease in the first quarter of 2020, in part, because our facilities currently operate as essential businesses,” the publicly traded company, which has 521 employees, reported in securities filings April 13.

Jason Bonfigt, Broadwind Energy’s vice president, said Friday that changed in recent weeks.

“Without the support of the PPP loan, there was a strong likelihood that we would have had to consider targeted cost reductions, including a reduction-in-force of valued staff,” Bonfigt said. “Broadwind met all of the requirements set forth by the U.S. treasury to apply for the PPP loan and did so in good faith, ensuring continued employment for our workers during a period of widespread economic uncertainty.”

The SBA permits some businesses, such as restaurants, to treat each location as a separate entity. That allowed the Gibsons steakhouse chain in Chicago to get a loan.

“We applied for it and were fortunate to get some relief,” Gibsons chairman Stephen Lombardo III says, though he would not disclose how much money the company got.

Lombardo says that about 1,800 of Gibsons’ 2,000 workers have gone back to work at its 10 restaurants, which are offering takeout meals during the shutdown.

SigmaTron International Inc. of Elk Grove Village, which has more than 3,106 employees worldwide, got $6.3 million on April 23, according to its federal filings.

Unknown: how many of those employees work at the company’s factories in Mexico, Vietnam and China.

803,478,https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239775/tesla-plan-workers-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-pandemic-fremont,2020-04-28,Tesla pauses plan to bring back workers as Bay Area extends stay-at-home order,"Over the weekend, Tesla told some of its employees in California to get ready to return to work this week. But by Monday, the company reversed course and told those employees to stay at home. Now, it faces the possibility that its electric car factory will have to remain closed for longer than previously anticipated as public health officials say they will extend the stay-at-home orders in the San Francisco Bay Area through much of May.

Tesla told employees in early April that it hoped to bring them back on May 4th — a goal that was communicated in the same internal email where Tesla announced company-wide pay cuts and the placement of hundreds of workers on unpaid leave.

It’s not currently clear if the leaders of the six Bay Area counties will relax some parts of their orders, as a few states have started to do, and more details are expected later this week. The counties were the first in the country to issue a formal stay-at-home order when they announced it on March 16th. San Francisco mayor London Breed said she expects “some lower-risk activities to be allowed to resume,” but urged residents that the goal is to “build on the progress we’ve made.”

More details are expected from officials later this week

Tesla’s quick about-face caused some whiplash among its factory line workers, according to one who spoke with The Verge on the condition of anonymity because the furloughed employees weren’t expecting to be called back so soon. “Why would they furlough us for only a couple weeks? They wouldn’t, they expect this to [last] longer,” this person said last month. But when the company sent out the first emails this past weekend about coming back, this person said “I was getting frantic texts from people I know on the line who were being told they are starting back on Monday.”

Not going back to work, they said, is a relief for some of the workers — even the ones on unpaid leave. “We all have the same mindset, and it’s this: COVID-19 has not hit its peak in the area where we work or the areas where we live, so everyone is still at risk,” this person said. “Putting us back into an environment to which we could not social distance such as the production line or the shuttles would be a huge mistake and cause for our workplace to be hugely compromised as well as the towns we go back to.”

Tesla initially resisted the stay-at-home order and was one of the last automakers in the US to suspend operations. The company told local officials (and employees) that it had been deemed “national critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security and that the California factory should therefore remain open. This sparked a back-and-forth between the Tesla and the local sheriff’s office and health department about whether the company’s car manufacturing plant was an “essential business” or causing a “public health risk.”

The company eventually relented and announced it would close down the plant on March 23rd, though it continued to fight to keep its operations going right up until that date. A number of workers also had to report to the factory during the week following the shutdown to finish working on cars Tesla ultimately delivered as part of the company’s typical end-of-quarter push. (Tesla also halted most operations at its solar panel factory in New York and at the original Gigafactory in Nevada before announcing the salary cuts and furloughs.)

That push, combined with the launch of the Model Y and early success with the newly opened Gigafactory in China, helped Tesla beat expectations for its first quarter delivery and production figures despite the pandemic. What that means for the company’s bottom line will be revealed when Tesla announces its first quarter financial results on Wednesday.",real

Since the new coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December, the infectious respiratory disease COVID-19 has spread rapidly within China and to neighboring countries and beyond.

The first confirmed coronavirus cases outside China occurred on Jan. 20, in Japan, Thailand and South Korea. On Jan. 21, the first case in the U.S. was identified in Washington state.

On Jan. 24, the first two European cases were confirmed in France. By Feb. 1, eight European nations had confirmed cases of COVID-19, and a month later that count had risen to 24 countries with at least 2,200 cases, most of them in Italy. On March 11, Italy eclipsed 10,000 cases and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic — the first since H1N1 in 2009. That's also when China, the original epicenter, began seeing drops in daily counts of new cases.

March also saw exponential spread of the virus throughout the U.S., with all 50 states reporting cases by March 17.

In the past few months, Americans have discovered the astonishing variety of things that can happen in a parking lot. Teach a seminar? Yes. Get married? Yes. Go to church? Amen.

This may not surprise anyone who has been to a college football tailgate, which proves that only your imagination can limit what happens in the parking lot. But there is one way that we cannot turn America into one big tailgate while we wait out the pandemic: We are not going to spend the summer peeing outside.

The car is pretty good at social distancing, but don’t mistake car culture for a coronavirus cure. Even drivers have to go. The primary confined space that Americans uneasily share with strangers isn’t mass transit. It’s the public bathroom.

Bathrooms occupy a weird place in American life: They are at once an infectious chokepoint on the road to a functioning society and our only everyday infrastructure of good public health. As we reenter public spaces this summer, are we supposed to bolt bathrooms because we fear they will spread the disease, or open them so that people can wash their hands?

At the moment, any trip out in the city will remind you of the idea popularized by the urban planner Clara Greed: the bladder’s leash. The leash is pretty short, because there is nowhere to pee. Semiopen businesses have bathrooms, of course, but access is subject to even more negotiation and judgment than usual.

The bladder’s leash was already a fact of everyday life for some workers, including street vendors and New York City cab drivers, who have blamed the city’s lack of public restrooms for their parking tickets, dehydration, and incidence of diabetes. It is, like so many things about city design, worse for women.

Last week, Slate’s Mary Harris interviewed Christopher Escobar, who owns an art house movie theater in Atlanta. Escobar has cleverly appropriated his parking lot for drive-in movies and encourages moviegoers to patronize local restaurants before they arrive. As for the bathroom, he said, “We’ll encourage people to use the bathrooms before they come in.”

That’s not going to work for The Irishman, at 3½ hours, and it’s definitely not going to scale. Waffle House, which is seating patrons according to social distancing guidelines in reopened states, has single-use bathrooms. The company has “added enhanced sanitation protocols,” Waffle House director of public relations Njeri Boss told me. By this she means: Employees are supposed to clean the bathroom more frequently.

Landlords, property managers, and tenants are thinking hard about this issue. Euripides Pelekanos, the CEO of the chain Bareburger, told me to look out for three big changes in bathrooms at his restaurants when they reopen: touchless everything, frequent cleaning, and sanitizer outside the bathroom. Air-stirring hand dryers are likely to be furloughed for some time. In multistall bathrooms, every other toilet may be closed to enforce capacity restrictions (already underway in some Chinese workplaces) and maintain distance. A trade-off presents itself: An every-other-toilet system puts you farther away from other bathroom users, but also increases the ratio of users per toilet. And as malls and offices start to fill up, you risk a capacity crunch. For the fellows, the pandemic may be what finally puts partitions between every urinal.

Bathrooms are also the only place most Americans can wash their hands, which is a key step in coronavirus prevention. At the Villa Savoye, the modernist “machine for living” that Le Corbusier designed outside of Paris in 1929, a stand-alone sink in the front hall marks the forgotten architectural obsession with hygiene. These days, the only thing less sanitary than a public bathroom is not having one, which is one reason that contractors say construction sites are not, despite the open air, coronavirus-resistant workplaces.

The pandemic may be what finally puts partitions between every urinal.

On the whole, bathrooms get neither attention from architects nor investment from a nervous public. “Freud, poo-poo, you don’t have to work hard to learn where the anxiety comes from,” says the sociologist Harvey Molotch, co-editor of the 2010 volume Toilet. Fear of vagrants, drugs, sex, and crime (or some combination therein) has greatly diminished our toilet infrastructure. The New York City subway once had more than 1,600 toilets; today it has just a few dozen for more than 5 million daily riders. Poor people with long commutes, women, and older people are the ones who feel the sharpest tug of the bladder’s leash. (Young men are so willing to pee anywhere that their urine has eaten away at the foundations of the National Gallery in London and a soccer stadium in Brazil.)

More recently, the opioid crisis has prompted a new toilet panic, as bookstores, coffee shops, and other “third spaces” rush to install code-locked bathrooms to discourage heroin users. For American men, Molotch adds, bathrooms are ruled by a silence of homophobic anxiety, which robs them of the friendly banter that characterizes other bathroom experiences.

The fear of disease, in particular, has had a long influence on bathroom design and creation. London physician John Snow founded the field of public health by mapping cholera outbreaks to a well contaminated by human and animal waste. Since the 19th century, public health crises have prompted officials to build more fountains, toilets, and sinks. Frank Lloyd Wright forced us all to look at each other’s shoes in the can because shin-high stalls made it easier to clean the floor. (And, now, easier to watch for misbehavior.) White walls, tiles, and porcelain fixtures all made bathrooms brighter, and brightness was associated with cleanliness.

It’s not that the bathroom poses a more serious coronavirus risk than anything else you’re doing. (Workplace consultants believe the bottleneck on the return to downtown offices will be elevators.) But it does serve as a reminder that what we’re really talking about, when we talk about density as a factor in disease transmission, is particular spaces that a number of people have to share.

This slipperiness of the term density is what allows lazy op-ed writers to group together New York City and South Dakota meatpacking towns in the same group of coronavirus hot spots with a common character. Density is really a measure of persons in a given space. To use it in a comparison, you have to keep the denominator the same, or it starts to look like my living room is denser than Manhattan when we watch a movie.

What meatpacking plants have in common with hard-hit New York neighborhoods is people sharing confined spaces such as bathrooms. (Interestingly, of the 15 biggest U.S. metro areas, the three with the highest share of one-bathroom housing units are the coronavirus-ravaged cities of New York, Boston, and Detroit, according to the 2017 American Housing Survey.) Meatpacking plants are a reminder that even in low-density places, people come together to share space. So are churches. And in all those places, people who come together will share bathrooms. The average office worker, according to a California water use textbook, flushes the toilet between two and 3½ times a day. About half of restaurant visitors use the facilities.

Whether in Sioux Falls or in Queens, bathrooms may play a role in transmission. Elsewhere, they’ll play a role in prevention. Either way, the reopening of society only goes as far as our confidence in the spaces we share. Bathrooms are at the top of the list. That America has so few public restrooms, and the few we have are so poorly maintained (see Louis-Ferdinand Céline’s wonderful description of New York City’s “fecal grotto”) is thanks to the same starved public sector that is unable to roll out the more complex public hygiene measures that a pandemic demands. Bathrooms need to be safe, but they also need to feel safe. Otherwise, all of America is on the bladder’s leash, and the leash is short.",real

(TMU) – If you’re currently stuck at home and facing government lockdown orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we won’t blame you if you’re currently fantasizing about the vacations you want to take once the world returns to relative normalcy.

While books, YouTube travel vlogs, and even open world video games offer great distractions, in many ways they also offer serious fuel to our wanderlust – inspiring us to do nothing more than get out of our current environs and delve deep into other cultures, climes, and cuisines.

And of all the most amazing tourist destinations out there, one country stands tall with its dazzling combination of ancient culture and stunning modernity – and that country is Japan.

And now, Japanese officials are reportedly considering a plan that would see the government potentially step up to pay half of the travel expenses of foreign travelers to the Land of the Rising Sun.

However, the plan is merely just a proposal – at least for the time being.

Since the coronavirus pandemic became a global concern earlier this year, the brakes have been hit on global travel – as well as the lucrative tourism industries of various countries.

This has been no less true in Japan, where a mere 2,900 tourists visited the country this April – a vast and precipitous drop from the 2,926,685 people who visited the country last April, according to leading Japanese newspaper The Mainichi. On a nationwide level, the country has seen a staggering 99.9 percent year-on-year drop in tourism.

No tourists in #Japan? No problem. 😎 😏 Cherry blossoms 🌸, Japanese style

🇯🇵 🗾 🏯 More than 1,000 deer 🦌 enjoying the flowers and calm at Nara Park, Osaka. The animals even know how to bow after getting fed crackers by the visitors. pic.twitter.com/MXS3rJ41pS — 𝐏𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐨𝐬𝐨𝐩𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝙋𝙨𝙮𝙘𝙝𝙤𝙡𝙤𝙜𝙞𝙨𝙩 (@PsychologyDoc) May 17, 2020

To prevent the continuation of the brutal collapse of tourism, the Japanese government is now considering giving the green light to a 1.35 trillion yen (over $12.5 billion USD) fund to lure back foreign visitors. Japanese Tourism Agency chief Hiroshi Tabata said that the scheme could begin as soon as July if COVID-19 infections continue to subside.

It remains unclear what exactly would be covered under the plan in terms of airfare or which categories of hotels and lodging.

Japan is currently facing its lowest number of visitors from abroad since 1964. Normally, spring is one of the country’s most popular tourist seasons, especially because it’s cherry blossom season, when the blossoming trees around Tokyo, Kyoto and Mt. Fuji attract thousands of sightseers. This year, however, visitors have largely been restricted to these deer – which, needless to say, doesn’t do much for the tourism industry in terms of generating revenue.

Additionally, Japan has barred entry to nationals and passenger flights from roughly 100 nations. This includes China – one of Japan’s major tourism markets, which had been hitting record highs during the winter amid warming people-to-people relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, who have been plagued by poor bilateral ties in the past.

To make matters worse, Japan has also been forced to postpone the upcoming 2020 Summer Olympic Games that were due to take place in Tokyo.

The country’s other landmarks and attractions have also been temporarily closed, including Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea, Universal Studios Japan, and a number of museums, festivals, and other mass events.

However, in a sign that good news may be on the horizon, only three new coronavirus infections were reported in the capital on Friday – the lowest figure since the government declared a state of emergency in April.

So while Japan is not quite out of the woods yet – as is the case in much of the rest of the world – the reported plan to slash travel expenses in half for tourists does seem tantalizing.

After all, where else can we be treated to the priceless scenery of Japan’s villages, the brilliant natural beauty of the country’s mountains and islands, or the irreplaceable flavors of genuine Japanese cuisine?

Well, this might just be the chance you’ve been waiting for.",fake

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester United have urged fans to stay away from their Old Trafford stadium should the venue be used for behind closed doors games during the Premier League’s resumption of play.

The league remains in talks with the government about whether matches in closed stadiums will be held at neutral venues or, as many clubs prefer, on the usual home and away basis.

In an email to supporters, United confirmed they will refund season ticket and ticket holders for games held behind closed doors and made a plea for supporters to stay away from matches.

“We share your disappointment that you will not be able to watch United in person from within the stadium, but we would encourage you to give your continued loyal support from the comfort and safety of your home. To help with that, the Premier League and their media partners will work to deliver the very best broadcast coverage of our games,” the club said.

“We also ask for your co-operation not to travel to any stadiums at which we are playing on matchdays. By supporting from home and following government guidance, you will be playing your part to keep your friends, your family and all United fans safe.”

The Premier League is exploring a number of options for broadcasting of behind closed doors games including use of audio effects and computer generated “fans”.",real

Arlene Chesley, 78

Charles County, May 6

Arlene Chesley moved into Charles County Nursing and Rehabilitation — now Sagepoint Senior Living — in 1999.

Jaimala ‘Mala’ Singh, 65

Lutherville, May 5

Growing up in India, Jaimala ‘Mala’ Singh designed saris and tapestries there, then moved for marriage to Baltimore in 1980, eventually becoming one of the country’s top-selling designers for Calico, a design-store chain. But to those who knew her well, Singh was most memorable as a whirlwind of caring — a charismatic, attentive mother, aunt, wife and friend in stylish Punjabi clothing who was always present if someone was hurting or in need.

Yu Lihua, 90

Gaithersburg, April 30

Yu Lihua was one of the most important Chinese American writers of her day. She published more than two dozen books, the fruit of a fascination — and obsession — with writing that spanned 75 years. The work guided her and her mostly Chinese-speaking readers through heartbreak, divorce, struggles over identity and belonging, and questions of sex, sexism, friendship and family. She pushed herself, and those she loved, with a mantra she held onto from a grade-school teacher who read one of her early stories: “You can make something of yourself.” She died of covid-19 in a suburban Maryland retirement complex.

Alyce Gullattee, 91

Washington, April 30

It was not unusual for Alyce Gullattee, a pioneering psychiatrist and devoted civil rights activist, to wander alone down alleys in Northwest Washington, at the height of the crack epidemic of the 1980s, searching for a patient she feared had overdosed. She would become one of the nation’s most respected experts on substance abuse in a career that spanned half a century at Howard University, where she spent a career serving as an associate professor of psychiatry and as director of the school’s Institute on Substance Abuse and Addiction. Before her death, Gullattee was the oldest faculty member at Howard.

Born in 1914, she lived to see the other side of the 1918 flu pandemic, women’s suffrage, the Great Depression and two world wars — all before she moved from her home in Clover, S.C., to the District in the mid-1950s, where worked for more than two decades as a sales associate at Jelleff’s, a department store in Northwest Washington, until it closed in 1979.

Carroll County, April 15 and April 7

Lawrence Nokes was admitted to Carroll Hospital Center on March 30 and intubated. After about a week in a coma, his prognosis improved, his family recalled. He started to breathe on his own. When he regained consciousness, Nokes asked for just one person: Minnette, his wife of 24 years.

Minnette Nokes had died days earlier, on April 7, a day before her 72nd birthday, of a heart attack. The medical examiner’s office said she posthumously tested positive for the coronavirus. Once Lawrence Nokes found out, his breathing grew raspy again. He died on April 15, eight days after his wife.

Temple Hills, April 15

Michael Miller was rarely spotted alone. In the nine years he worked at the Silver Spring bus depot, he was most often seen in “a crowd of fellas,” and on summer weekends he hosted barbecues at his Temple Hills home, playing ’70s music while grilling ribs.

Both were cut short on April 13 when Miller, who lived in Alexandria, Va., died of complications of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. He was 52 and otherwise healthy, his mother said.

The statistics are shifting and shapeless as sand. The uncertainty makes it hard to breathe. The grief is upon us, in waves, and the worst, we fear, still lies ahead.

Yet hour by hour we march forward. We reach out through windows and screens to parents we fear we may never hug again. We find ways to help a neighbor or a nurse. We leave a pack of gloves for the trash collector. We pick up an extra jug of milk for a friend. We take to the streets and burst into ragged song, and we laugh. We welcome new babies into an uncertain, confusing world, and we allow ourselves to be overtaken by the world's oldest and most elemental joy. We learn to appreciate every breath.

The show’s seventh season finale will air as a half-live-action, half animated special next week.

The animation will be comic book-style, according to Variety. Based on the artwork above, it looks like the episode might be visually similar to movies like Sin City, which used similar art styles. The animated component will be added to incorporate the live-action scenes that have already been filmed, Variety reports, with lead actors James Spader and Megan Boone recording audio from their individual homes. Everyone’s work on the episode will be carried out remotely.

The animation style evokes Frank Miller’s Sin City

Although The Blacklist is the latest show to figure out a way to tell a narrative story by introducing new methods to editing an episode from home, it’s far from the first. CBS’ legal drama All Rise produced an entire episode remotely, incorporating video conferencing tools like Zoom to conduct a court case while characters practiced social distancing protocols. NBC’s own Parks and Recreation found its 10 main cast members reunite for a one-off episode about the coronavirus pandemic. The network’s long running Saturday Night Live has also produced two episodes completely remote since mass self isolation protocols went into effect in the United States.

The specials have received applause from critics who have stressed how impressive it is that teams have created each episode. Some critics have stressed that while it works as a one-off, the episodes prove that television is a long way off from producing seasons long entertainment executed in completely remote settings.

This is just an outright lie.

These government clowns are making it harder and harder for the average American to trust them.

DISRN reported:

Washington epidemiologists have admitted that multiple victims of gunshot wounds who had also been diagnosed with coronavirus have been counted as COVID-19 deaths, although they say deaths from the virus are still likely being undercounted in the state. Epidemiologists with the Washington State Department of Health said that the “number of nuances” in coronavirus data makes it difficult to render a quick assessment in the cause of death. The state is currently counting anyone that dies with COVID-19 in its death toll. “We currently do have some deaths that are being reported that are clearly from other causes. We have about 5 deaths less than 5 deaths that we know of that are related to obvious other causes. In this case, they are from gunshot wounds,” said Dr. Katie Hutchison, Health Statistics Manager for the Washington State Department of Health. The state is currently reviewing between 20 and 30 similar cases to understand what role — if any — coronavirus played in the deaths, Hutchison said, adding the process will take between six and 12 months.

843,195,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/americans-will-have-cure-coronavirus-epidemic-their-own/,2020-03-31,Americans Will Have To Cure The Coronavirus Epidemic on Their Own,"Original article written by Bill Sardi can be viewed on LewRockwell.com; the following is an excerpt which represents the author's opinion and does not necessarily reflect those of WHN:

I penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation’s 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.

These hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.

Here are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a “dead stop.”

1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.

If you haven’t noticed, quarantines don’t work. Look at the data from Italy (“All of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise” – CNN)

Americans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)

Only a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.

Coronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is “10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.” But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say “the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%….. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.”

Forcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.

While the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.

There is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.

Given that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.

It would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.

Pharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.

Vaccines aren’t reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don’t efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.

Influenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation’s 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.

2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.

An alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.

Here the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium – tuberculosis.

If the public health agencies and hospitals can’t provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don’t have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.

3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.

It has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.

Drugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.

The President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a “godsend,” which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.

Quercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.

Few physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.

If the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.

4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.

One such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.

Notice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.

It is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public’s best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can’t rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.

Given that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources. Don’t listen to politicians who complain about a lack of hospital ventilators. According to one emergency room physician, 70-90% of virally infected patients with pneumonia that are placed on ventilators die. Ventilators are a last-ditch effort to buy time and hope for a cure. Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.

Fear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning. Because fear trumps information and logic.",fake

Already 61 games deep into a campaign filled with growing pains and roster instability, the Wolves were set to play three times in three days this weekend. They were scheduled to have two more three-game weekends before the end of the season.

When the Wolves will face those exams is now unknown.

The American Hockey League joined the NHL and other prominent U.S. sports leagues in suspending its season Thursday due to concerns over the coronavirus.

The Wolves had key divisional games against San Antonio (Friday), Rockford (Saturday) and Manitoba, but they have been postponed. The team cited recommendations from Gov. Pritzker and top health officials in announcing all remaining home games will be suspended, in a release that came out before the league itself revealed its decision.

“Governor Pritzker has been working with leading public health experts to determine the best courses of action to prevent the further spread of COVID-19,” Wolves chairman Don Levin said in a statement. “We believe whole-heartedly in Gov. Pritzker’s recommendations and will do everything we can to keep this coronavirus from spreading.”

Counting this weekend, the Wolves had eight home games remaining, including what was supposed to be the April 11 regular-season finale with Manitoba.

”With the health and safety of our players, officials, staff and fans of primary importance, the American Hockey League has announced the suspension of play until further notice, effective immediately, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic,” the league said in a release. “The AHL will continue to monitor developments and will provide updates on the 2019-20 season at the appropriate time.”

As recently as Wednesday, the Wolves were anticipating playing this weekend. They sent a news release explaining the precautions at Allstate Arena, stressing the Village of Rosemont’s prevention strategies.

But that release was sent before Wednesday’s events, when the NBA postponed its regular season after Utah’s Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with coronavirus. Since then, the NCAA has canceled all of its upcoming tournaments and MLB has announced its regular season will be pushed back, among other sports-related changes.

Thursday’s announcement said the team is working on “procedures to determine the best way to deliver credits and refunds to people who have purchased tickets for these postponed games.”

It also recommends season ticket holders contact account representatives immediately.",real

Trump volunteered the disclosure during a question-and-answer session with reporters at the White House as he met restaurant executives whose businesses are reeling from the impact of the virus.

“I’m taking hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “I’ve been taking it for the last week and a half. A pill every day.”

Weeks ago, Trump had promoted the drug as a potential treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus, but subsequent studies found that it was not helpful. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about its use.

In an April 24 statement, the FDA said it was “aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems” in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or an older drug, chloroquine.

Trump, 73, who is tested daily for the virus, said he had asked the White House physician if it was OK to take the drug, and the doctor told him: “Well, if you’d like it.”

The president, a well-known germaphobe, has nonetheless refused to wear a protective mask in the West Wing.

White House physician Sean Conley said in a memo that Trump was in “very good health” and had been receiving regular COVID-19 testing, which has all been negative since one of his support staff tested positive for the disease two weeks ago.

“After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley said in the memo released by the White House.

‘RECKLESS’

Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asked on CNN about Trump’s taking the drug, said: “He’s our president. I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say weight group what is morbidly obese, they say.”

According to the results of an annual presidential physical examination conducted in February 2019, Trump had gained weight over the past year and was now in the obese range, although remaining in “very good health overall.” reut.rs/3bGMCtl

Morbid obesity is generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight relative to height - of 40 or higher. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is overweight and 30 or above is obese.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in an MSNBC interview that what Trump did with hydroxychloroquine was “reckless” and was giving people “false hope.”

Trump’s disclosure came as Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) reported progress in a potential vaccine for the virus. The only drug that has emerged so far as a potential treatment is Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) remdesivir.

Fox News Channel, immediately after Trump’s remarks, interviewed Dr. Bob Lahita, chairman of medicine at St. Joseph University Hospital in New Jersey, who cautioned people not to take hydroxychloroquine.

“There’s no effect that we have seen and we have treated multiple patients with it,” he said.

Trump said he also took a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. In conjunction with hydroxychloroquine, Trump said he was taking zinc.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” he said.",real

The wave of shutdowns and shuttered economies caused by the coronavirus pandemic fueled a momentous decline in global greenhouse gas emissions, although one unlikely to last, a group of scientists reported Tuesday.

As covid-19 infections surged in March and April, nations worldwide experienced an abrupt reduction in driving, flying and industrial output, leading to a startling decline of more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That includes a peak decline in daily emissions of 17 percent in early April, according to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the drop was much steeper.

Scientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly — and quickly — to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over coming decades, although none have suggested that a deadly global pandemic is the way to do so.

Tuesday’s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 percent compared to last year — an unheard-of drop in normal times, but considerably less dramatic than the decline during the first few months of the year when economies screeched to a halt. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly, or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life.

The unprecedented situation produced by the coronavirus has offered a glimpse into the massive scale required to cut global emissions, year after year, to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord. Last fall, a U.N. report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 percent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

[In bleak report, U.N. says drastic action is only way to avoid worst effects of climate change]

Tuesday’s study underscores how far the world remains from that long-term aspiration. The forced plunge in greenhouse gas emissions in recent months, while extraordinary, returned carbon pollution levels only to those last seen in 2006. And the recent changes are unlikely to last.

“History suggests this will be a blip,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus’s effect by nation and economic sector. “The 2008 [financial] crisis decreased global emissions 1.5 percent for one year, and they shot back up 5 percent in 2010. It was like it never happened.”

Although the decline in emissions during the pandemic may have been unprecedented, it was relatively small when it comes to combating global warming. The peak 17 percent decline in global emissions — which occurred in early April — meant nations continued to generate more than 80 percent of carbon pollution.

Researchers say the experience demonstrates how broad structural changes to the energy system are critical if the world is to slash emissions in a meaningful, sustainable way.

“We can see now that behavior change alone is not going to do it,” said Corinne Le Quéré, lead author of the study and director of Britain’s Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research.

Le Quéré said she expected to find even larger reductions in the power and industrial sectors during the pandemic. Instead, she said, many sources of carbon dioxide and other pollutants have continued steadily, almost on autopilot, even as much of the world has ground to a halt.

Appliances continue to run, office buildings must be maintained and some factories continue to hum.

“There’s a lot of inertia in the infrastructure, in the built environment,” she said. “It seems like many things are able to function on their own, at least for a short time.”

Emissions have fallen before — during world wars and economic recessions, for instance, and markedly during the Great Depression. But experts do not think the modern world has experienced a plunge so sudden and sharp as in recent months.

“In absolute terms, it will be the biggest,” said Glen Peters, one of the study’s authors and an expert at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway. “In relative terms, you will have to go back quite some [time] to find big changes like that.”

Most researchers agree that emissions are all but certain to bounce back once countries reopen. Already, demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many U.S. states begin easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than $1 at some pumps.

Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.

“Where they put this stimulus is really critical,” Le Quéré said. “It’s 2020, and there’s not much time to tackle climate change.”

Some world leaders have pledged to push for a shift toward greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.

Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country’s effort to slash its emissions remains “undiminished” by covid-19 and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in Parliament last week, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.

“Inadvertently, the planet this year will [have] greatly reduced its CO2 emissions. … We need to entrench those gains,” Johnson told lawmakers. “I don’t want to see us going back to an era of the same type of emissions as we’ve had in the past. Aviation like every other sector must keep its carbon lower.”

Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.

“It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,” Merkel told a gathering of leaders focused on climate change.

The new research was conducted by Le Quéré, Jackson, Peters, and 10 other colleagues affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.

Normally, global emissions are calculated on an annual basis; doing so more rapidly, nearly in real time, presented a scientific challenge. Tuesday’s study used a combination of energy data across multiple sectors, as well as data on the strenuousness of lockdowns across 69 countries that account for 97 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, to estimate the reductions.

The results varied greatly across different sectors. Airplane emissions plunged by as much as 60 percent — but airlines represent a relatively small fraction of global emissions. Emissions from surface transportation, one of the largest sources, fell 36 percent at the peak of the shutdowns.

“Passenger vehicles are down a bit more,” Jackson said. “Commercial vehicles and long-haul trucking are down much less. I’m staying at home, but the Amazon delivery vehicle is still driving around.”

Emissions linked to home energy use actually increased about 3 percent, not surprising during a time when people are confined to their homes, using more appliances, lighting, heating and cooling. But industrial electricity demand plummeted, leading to net electricity declines overall.

Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic — more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips — individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.

“Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,” he said.

Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.

“I don’t think there’s much of a silver lining to covid-19 for the climate,” he said, “unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.”",real

""It has come to our attention that some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War"", Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters on Sunday.

He noted that the two nations have to find a way for peaceful coexistence, adding, however, that the issue of Hong Kong is an internal Chinese affair, and foreign meddling is unacceptable.

The minister also slammed lawsuits filed by the US states of Missouri and Mississippi against Beijing over its coronavirus response, stating they have no legal basis.

""The Chinese side has an open position regarding the scientific cooperation with the international scientific community to study the origin of the coronavirus. At the same time, we believe that this process should be professional, fair and constructive. By fair we mean that in the study of the [COVID-19] origin, political interference should be avoided"", Wang Yi said.

""Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US"", Wang added. ""This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies"".

According to him, a new security law for Hong Kong should be imposed ""without the slightest delay"".

The news comes after Beijing proposed national security legislation to ban secession and foreign interference in Hong Kong, resulting in a massive backlash in the Western media.

Apart from the coronavirus inquiry and tensions around Hong Kong, China and the US clashed on economic issues, as the American authorities criticised numerous countries for joining China's Belt and Road Initiative.

The US Senate has also recently passed a bill demanding companies confirm that they are not owned or controlled by foreign governments, which could prevent many Chinese companies from listing their shares on American exchanges.

Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced that Washington may completely cut off diplomatic relations with Beijing over the ongoing coronavirus crisis. He also accused the Chinese side of attempting to conceal coronavirus-related information, and claimed that he had seen evidence that COVID-19 originated at a Wuhan virology laboratory.

886,1140,https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/dr-blaylock-face-masks-pose-serious-risks-healthy11,2020-05-16,Dr. Blaylock: Face Masks Pose Serious Risks to the Healthy,"

Originally published on www.technocracy.news

Dr. Russell Blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick, but they also create serious health risks to the wearer. The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. ⁃ TN Editor

With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception.

This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness (asymptomatic) or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection--mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mainly intubation and use of a ventilator (respirator), may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals.

By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD

As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, ""None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.""1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.

It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.

Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.

There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask (cloth or paper mask) in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange (breathing) to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2

They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.

A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.

Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind--which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.

While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.

The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7

People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.10

There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.

It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13

It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.

One should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make.

Once added, users can tap the stickers to instantly be taken to a donation page within the app where they can add credit card details and the donation amount. TikTok says it will match the first $10 million donated globally until May 27th.

The list of charities includes the CDC Foundation, Meals on Wheels, and the James Beard Foundation in the US, and the British Red Cross and Help Musicians in the UK. TikTok says it tried to choose charities that help the kinds of communities that use its service, and that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

The CDC Foundation and Meals on Wheels are among the charities

Although the initial list of charities is focused on those whose work is important during the COVID-19 pandemic, TikTok says its donation stickers will be an ongoing, permanent feature in the app. The stickers are currently available in the US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy.

TikTok isn’t the first social network to have added charity donation stickers. Last year Facebook and Instagram added similar features to their stories features. Instagram also added the option for nonprofit businesses to add donation buttons to their pages if they want a more permanent option.

If you want to add a donation sticker to your own TikTok video, you can do so by tapping on the COVID-19 Donation sticker in the editing page. You’ll then need to pick an organization before you can add the sticker to your video. TikTok says it will automatically add the #doubleyourimpact hashtag to any videos that use the stickers. Users have to be over 18 to donate.",real

Sanitation workers across the country are trying to adjust to unusually high waste levels in residential areas as the coronavirus pandemic shuts in much of the workforce at home. Waste in residential areas has spiked by as much as 40% in some parts of the country, according to one company's tally. To facilitate curbside pickup services, waste management companies are urging both their workers and clients to follow proper disposal protocols. To deal with the onslaught, some sanitation workers, who pick up and haul garbage and other waste, have begun to double or triple the number of trips they would make to residential neighborhoods under more normal circumstances. Often taken for granted, sanitation workers have become part of the frontline workforce keeping the country going even as the pandemic persists. And though they largely operate in the background of everyday life, they provide services that bolster comfortable living and cleanliness across the country. ""You can go your whole life without ever calling upon a firefighter or a police officer, but you can't go more than a couple days without having a sanitation worker in your life,"" said Belinda Mager, the director of communications at New York's sanitation department. ""They visit your block at least a couple days a week, and you may not even know it! But you'd know it if they were not there!"" Data collected in December from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that people who gather and dispose of waste and recyclable materials work the fifth most dangerous job in the United States. The coronavirus has heightened that risk factor. The pandemic adds to the inherent dangers of the job the risk of contracting the disease while handling waste with contaminated materials such as used tissues or face masks. This story is based on conversations with people linked to six waste removal groups in New York, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, five states that represent some of the greatest risk zones for sanitation workers.

The risks

In an effort to minimize employees' risk of contracting the disease, several waste removal groups have been urging the public to dispose of their waste safely by ""putting all trash in closed bags, carts or containers,"" said David Biderman, executive director and CEO of Solid Waste Association of North America, or SWANA, a nonprofit that advocates for efficient solid waste management. ""We don't want sanitation collection workers touching discarded tissues or other material from a home in which someone has tested positive to coronavirus,"" Biderman said. Some companies, such as Florida-based Waste Pro USA, have issued guidance on how to handle waste. The company created a flyer that educates ""customers on how to properly dispose of their trash and recycling to protect themselves and our crews that is available to download on our website"" said Ron Pecora, senior vice president of Waste Pro USA, which operates in 11 states. Increased safety protocols have also extended to the companies themselves. Sanitation workers have received gloves, masks, and disinfecting products from their employers to maximize their own safety. And they're encouraged to practice social distancing while collecting trash. ""Traditionally everyone always wore gloves. But now everyone wears a thinner latex glove on the inside, in addition to a thick glove on the outside,"" said Josh Eisenstein, director of community outreach at Filco Carting, a Brooklyn, New York, waste management company.

Trucks are cleaned and disinfected frequently, said a spokesperson from Republic Services, an Arizona-based waste collection company operating in 41 states and Puerto Rico. ""All of our facilities and equipment are on an enhanced cleaning schedule, with cleanings scheduled multiple times per day,"" the spokesperson said. In Arizona, the new safety protocols have extended into processing centers, too, where employees are separated by ""plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe."" SWANA estimates that nearly 1,000 sanitation workers have tested positive for the coronavirus around the country, ""the majority of them in the New York City metropolitan area,"" Biderman said. But it's likely that these workers contracted the virus because of ""community spread, not contact with the trash,"" he added.

Spikes in residential waste

Waste among residential homes has increased as most Americans stay at home under shelter-in-place orders. ""Residential waste volume has increased between 5% to 35%, depending on the location, as Americans have been staying home and generating more trash and recyclables,"" Biderman said. At Waste Management, headquartered in Texas, residential waste went up by 25%, according to Janette Micelli, director of external affairs. To keep up with the unexpected volume of waste, several sanitation companies have suspended bulk pick-up services, meaning that sanitation workers temporarily avoid picking up large materials like tossed-out furniture. About 80 communities nationwide have reported temporary suspensions in curbside recycling or yard waste collection, according to estimates from SWANA. ""This was because these communities' sanitation departments have limited bandwidth and resources, and need to use their assets (trucks, people) to collect trash,"" Biderman explained. Some communities have begun to resume these services. In Southern California, sanitation workers have shut down some recycling facilities due to inability to keep adequate distance between workers, causing some curbside recyclables to end up in the landfill. Meanwhile, some companies have altered their schedules to keep up with the increased need for waste removal. Shelter-in-place guidelines have caused Americans to be ""thrown off their routine,"" said Pecora of Waste Pro USA, which has seen a 40% increase in residential waste in some areas. ""Rather than placing their materials out before going to work, they have been placing their materials out after our trucks have serviced their streets, resulting in a spike in calls concerning missed pickups,"" Pecora said. Additionally, Waste Pro USA workers have been reporting higher numbers of ""bulk items,"" including old televisions and mattresses, in Florida. It is an indication that many Americans are using the time at home to do some heavy-duty spring cleaning. ""This huge volume has resulted in significant increased expense as trucks are filling up and have to dispose, and then go back to same routes to complete,"" Pecora said.

Commercial waste falls

As residential waste rises, commercial waste is in a state of free fall, tumbling because of closures of nonessential businesses and stay-at-home guidelines. The biggest blow to commercial waste occurred ""in major cities,"" according to SWANA's Biderman. Filco Carting in Brooklyn has seen commercial waste drop by 50% since the pandemic hit. Commercial waste removal from places like restaurants and small businesses can only be handled by privately owned waste removal companies in New York. Once New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued orders of statewide shutdowns, business at New York waste removal companies began to drop off. ""Most private carters are operating with less trucks, as many customers are not operating, not producing waste and therefore less trucks are needed to collect the reduced waste,"" said Eisenstein of Filco. And businesses that have stayed open to offer essential services, like supermarkets, have reduced their waste, Eisenstein said, likely because fewer customers have been entering. Some of these businesses ""requested reduction in their frequency of pickups. Weeks ago when businesses were forced to close, many reached out to us to suspend service,"" he said.

When he was a businessman, putting crucial responsibilities on the shoulders of hapless sycophants only affected his bottom line. Now that he's leader-of-the-free-world, it's a life-and-death issue.

Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, has been running a shadow coronavirus task force that was supposed to secure personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and essential workers.

It failed, mostly because it was comprised of business people with no experience in science or medicine.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump trusts his cronies.

He relies on those who flatter him, never challenge him, and put his interests first. Qualifications are secondary, if considered at all.

His response to the pandemic has been no different, as cronies have presided over his administration's coronavirus response, to disastrous results.

It's not just that he's whittled down his cabinet and administration of any voices that put the country's interest ahead of his own, it's that the sycophants who remain have no business managing a health crisis.

A history of loyalty over competence

Before he got in the leading-the-free-world business, he ran a ""family business"" called the Trump Organization.

The Trump kids obviously had a leg up on the competitions. but there were plenty of executives who, as The New York Times put it in 2016, ""secured power not necessarily through fancy pedigrees or impressive credentials, but through decades of devotion to their boss.""

One of these executives, Trump Organization chief operating officer, caught Trump's eye in 1981 ""after Mr. Trump saw him eject some hecklers while working security at the United States Open tennis tournament,"" according to The Times.

Upon entering the White House, Trump made sure to bring cronies along for the ride.

Now Trump is presiding over a country undergoing the most devastating economic collapse (with no end in sight) since the Great Depression as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead of experts who could execute strategies to save lives, we're stuck with cronies..

Catastrophe of the cronies

When Trump belatedly set up his coronavirus task force in late February, he put together a team where only four of the seventeen members had backgrounds in science or medicine. But he did include National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, a former Wall Street economist and CNBC host with a spotty at best track record on actually understanding the economy.

At the time of the appointment — again this is late February — Kudlow went on CNBC to assure the public that the administration had the virus contained ""pretty close to airtight"" and that any potential outbreak might be a ""human tragedy"" but probably not an ""economic tragedy.""

About two weeks later, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 a pandemic, and the unraveling of the economy began. It continues unabated two months later.

Though Vice President Mike Pence is officially in charge of the administration's task force, Trump's ultimate crony, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, has been running his own ""shadow"" task force.

It's not the first time Kushner, the rich kid who failed in his own attempt at real estate baronhood, has been tasked by the president with leading sweeping projects far above his pay grade.

Kushner's unofficial task force consists of a volunteer squad of business associates. They've been focused on maintaining and strengthening supply chains during the pandemic, particularly the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals and essential workers.

The idea was that these bright young captains of industry would be able to use their private sector ingenuity to cut through the red tape inherent in government bureaucracy. And because they're volunteers and not paid employees of the government, they are essentially not subject to oversight.

The volunteers, who Kushner calls ""true patriots,"" have failed spectacularly.

As The Times reported, Kushner's team ""had little to no experience with government procurement procedures or medical equipment."" Some ""were told to prioritize tips on PPE availability from political allies and associates of President Trump"" — including Fox News hosts Brian Kilmeade and Jeannine Pirro, the young Trumpist activist Charlie Kirk of Turning Point USA, and ""a former ""Apprentice"" contestant who now works for the Trump campaign.

Almost none of the leads panned out. At least one led to a $69 million contract that yielded no equipment at all.

The incompetence so appalled Dr. Richard Bright of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (which reports to the Department of Health and Human Services) that he filed an 89-page whistleblower complaint. Bright is scheduled to testify before a House committee this Thursday.

This isn't a business

Trump, still obsessed with his television ratings and distracted by his prolonged Twitter rages, is failing pretty much every test of leadership during a global catastrophe. But if he were merely asleep at the wheel and left the machinery in the hands of capable people, the government's pandemic response might not be failing so appallingly.

Former FEMA deputy administrator Tim Manning told the Times, ""There's an old saying in emergency management — disaster is the wrong time to exchange business cards.""

Trump's penchant for cronyism kept him insulated from reality as a businessman, and perhaps as a result, his track record in business is little more than a long list of failures. To survive these financial calamities, Trump relied on bankruptcy, celebrity, and just stiffing the people who worked for him.

There's no hiding from the consequences of the pandemic. And it's not just contractors and creditors who are getting hurt by Trump's incompetence, it's the entire country.

In the age of the coronavirus, Trump's unqualified cronies are wasting precious time and resources. Lives are at stake and the margin for error is minuscule.

From the breakdown of the PPE supply chain, the failure to set up a broad and effective testing system, and the prioritization of keeping the economy going over issuing social distancing guidelines — Trump's ""best people"" have shown they're completely in over their head. The US response to the coronavirus was one of the worst in the world.

The difference between basic competence and whatever it is we have now has caused an unnecessary loss of life.

If he were capable of admitting his own fealty, he'd admit his ""best people"" have failed and prioritize the guidance of experts — or at least, the experienced — in the fields of science and medicine.

But that's not who Trump is. He doesn't make mistakes, in his own mind.

The facts don't lie, though. Trump's cronyism is dangerous and costing lives.",real

After announcing a 30-day suspension last week because of the new coronavirus, the league said Thursday it will follow last weekend’s recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to not hold events involving more than 50 people for eight weeks.

“MLS remains focused on playing the entire 2020 season and is evaluating all options, including pushing back the end of the season and playing MLS Cup in December, as the league did prior to the 2019 season,” the league said in a statement.

The MLS championship game had been scheduled for Nov 7.

On its website, the league announced the May 10 target for a return date.

Teams have played two matches in their 34-game, regular-season league schedule. The Fire, which returned to Soldier Field this season, was to have its home opener Saturday against Atlanta United.

MLS held its championship in December from 2012-18, then cut the length of its playoffs last year by changing the earlier rounds to knockouts from a two-leg format.

The measures were enacted to help address a projected $90 million budget shortfall this year, university leadership said in a message to the Northwestern community.

“Even if we resume on-campus activity in the fall, as we hope to do by phases, we are likely to see a significant shortfall in the 2021 fiscal year as well, perhaps as great as or greater than what we are experiencing this year,” the note signed by President Morton Schapiro said.

University leaders will be taking a 10% to 20% cut in pay. A 5% automatic contribution and 5% matched contribution to retirement plans will be suspended. The 250 workers who are being furloughed are staff members who are unable to work remotely or whose workloads have been significantly reduced.

“We expect to see repercussions from the pandemic for some time. Most of our work involves bringing large numbers of people together — in classrooms, dormitories, hospitals, libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, concert halls and athletic arenas. As such, a pandemic places extreme pressure on all our major functions and on associated revenue streams,” the message said.

The announcement comes weeks after the university announced other belt-tightening measures that included hiring restrictions, a pause on university travel and discretionary spending, and deferral of most facilities projects.

The university last month decided not to accept $8.5 million in federal stimulus money that it was allocated as part of the CARES Act — a decision that followed the lead of Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Yale and Duke universities.

Where do you think our current situation will rank among the Great Depression and the Great Recession?

In terms of depth, I think it will be as deep as even the Great Depression, way more than the Great Recession. But in my definition, the thing that makes it a depression is the collapse of the financial system and the extended/can't escape nature of it. And for that, a virus recession hopefully will not have to follow the normal rules and [the economy] can come back at least much of the way back much more quickly.

— Austan Goolsbee, economist, professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

How long will it take the U.S. economy to recover?

It's going to take some time to get back to under 10 percent unemployment. Like at least a few months. And perhaps longer. It took a decade to fully recover from the Great Recession of 2008-09 and we've essentially wiped out all those job gains in a matter of two months.

— Ben White, chief economic correspondent and author of our “Morning Money” newsletter.

Will an extended economic downturn spill over into housing markets? Or will the protections put in place after 2008 blunt the effects on housing prices?

The expectation would be that housing prices will go down — millions are out of work and the ones who could afford it don’t want to do open houses or are hunkering down. A bigger question is whether there might be structural problems in the housing market. My colleague Katy O’Donnell has written extensively about how the companies that collect mortgage payments are increasingly not banks and so they have a much more fragile business model (because they don’t take deposits). That’s been a concern because with some mortgage borrowers getting the ability to put off payments, those nonbank “servicers” are getting squeezed. If a bunch of those companies start to fail, it could cause a huge problem. Here’s some context on that.

— Victoria Guida, financial services reporter.

Why continue to tie health insurance to employment when a public health crisis exposes how precarious employment is?

I think the pandemic and huge job losses will definitely make some people question the logic of tying health insurance to employment — and that will certainly help progressives and liberal leaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders argue health care should come from the government, not particular jobs. That said, I am still not sure the pandemic will result in the creation of a single-payer, government-run health care system (even if Joe Biden wins the election in November 2020). Not all Democrats are in favor of it, and there are powerful special interests in Washington who oppose the idea, pandemic or no pandemic.

— Nancy Cook, White House reporter

Why does there seem to be little appetite among Senate Republicans for further stimulus, particularly when any boost to the economy would seemingly improve their chances of keeping the White House and Senate in November?

Senate Republicans are worried that they have approved packages worth trillions of dollars in such a short period of time and are worried about continuing to spend ""like Democrats,"" as they would call it.

They want to slow walk the next stimulus package to see if it is necessary to continue to spend so much money, but they also want to make sure the next package includes things like no liability for companies who bring back workers who get sick. So part of the delay is to try to gain leverage over the Dems.

There is also disagreement among the two parties over the need to bail out state and local governments. If state tax revenue continues to decrease (as we've seen in places like California), then states will have to lay off workers — just as the Trump administration has basically left the coronavirus response to the states.

— Nancy Cook, White House reporter.

Some unemployment recipients are earning more on unemployment than they did working. Will this cause major incentive issues as employees are called back to work?

The extra UI payments are only short-lived and job vacancies are at unprecedented lows. The problem is that tens of millions of people lost their jobs (hopefully temporarily) and we wanted to send them relief. The argument that people are paid a replacement rate higher than what they earned before for a couple of months is a red herring. When employers are expanding, then we want to think about the hiring incentives, and yes, it would cause problems if we stayed at the levels we have now. In a moment of free fall, though, we need to get money to people quickly and this was a way to do it.

— Austan Goolsbee, economist, professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.

What are economists modeling in unemployment for the different tiers of the labor market?

Layoffs so far have been concentrated among lower-paid workers; job losses have now hit 40 percent of low-income homes. And this summer, as Americans continue to hunker down, I expect we'll continue to see hurt in workers employed by the airlines and tourism industry.

People who fared OK, so far, are white collar workers who can easily do their jobs from home. But if the economic downturn continues, I'd argue few people will be immune from the economic hardship. Law firms, lobbying shops, corporations will have a hard time keeping their business going indefinitely and at the same profit margins if everything remains pretty closed down and no vaccine seems imminent.

Some days, I organize my rounds not by where patients are located but by what language they speak: Spanish, Chinese, English, Creole. That way, I can keep the same interpreter on the phone as I make my way from room to room. One in five Americans speaks a language other than English at home; half of New Yorkers do.

One morning, I gown up and step inside a patient’s room, the interpreter on speakerphone in my scrubs pocket. The patient is a deliveryman I admitted earlier that week; his breathing has worsened each day, requiring escalating doses of oxygen via nasal cannula, and now a face mask. I must tell him that, should his breathing worsen further, the next step will be intubation.

I speak carefully, in short paragraphs, pausing to allow the interpreter to translate. The man stares at me from behind his mask, waiting to learn what his future holds. Thirty seconds after I stop talking, as the interpreter completes her translation, his dark eyes widen, and slow recognition spreads across his face.

He asks what intubation entails, and I explain. Again a delay; again the unwelcome news starts to register. He asks how long he’ll remain on the ventilator. We can’t know for sure, I say, but I hope it’s not long. Tears escape his eyes and his breathing quickens. I worry that the conversation itself will tip him into extremis. During the coronavirus pandemic, I’ve avoided entering rooms more than once a day, but today I vow to return.

Outside, I rub foam sanitizer into my hands and remove my face shield. I forget that the interpreter is still on the line.

“Will that be all, doctor?” she says, a minute later, from my pocket.

“Yeah, thank you,” I reply. “That was pretty rough, right?”

“Yes,” she says. “There have been a lot of those conversations lately.”

In New York City, social distancing is working. The virus has claimed at least twelve thousand lives, but single-day deaths have declined steadily since April 7th, when nearly five hundred and sixty people died of COVID-19. New cases and hospitalizations have also fallen in recent weeks, even though many hospitals remain nearly full.

But, as this wave of the coronavirus starts to slow, I can’t help but notice that many of the people still getting infected are those who don’t have the luxury of distance—those who, by necessity or by trade, expose themselves and their families to the virus every day. We’re now debating whether it’s safe to reopen the economy, but for essential workers it never closed. Each morning, during the apex of the deadliest pandemic in a century, these men and women have been venturing out into the epicenter of disease, to cook and clean, deliver food and carry mail, drive buses and stock shelves, patrol the streets and tend to the ill. Many have paid with their health—some with their lives.

It’s becoming clear that essential workers experience a disproportionate share of death and disease owing to COVID-19. During one week not long ago, I cared for a police officer, a grocery-store clerk, and a bus driver. During another, my clinical service of fifteen patients included three food deliverymen. (The last time I can recall caring for a delivery worker was more than two years ago: his leg was broken after he was hit by an S.U.V. at a busy Manhattan intersection.)

The burden falls unevenly among racial and ethnic groups: in New York City, people of color comprise three-quarters of the city’s essential workers. Three-fifths of cleaning workers are Latino; more than forty per cent of public-transit workers are black. Latinos comprise twenty-nine per cent of the city’s population, but thirty-four per cent of all cases; black people are twenty-two per cent of the population but represent twenty-eight per cent of COVID-19 deaths. Many factors contribute. Communities of color have higher rates of poverty, housing instability, and chronic disease. They’re more likely to consist of dense or multigenerational households, in which the virus spreads more easily. These communities have experienced frequent, sometimes egregious, bias from the health-care system, which has engendered lasting mistrust and leads some people to forgo needed care.

In a pandemic, just going to work is risky. “All one has to do is stand on a platform and you’ll see that the trains are filled with black and brown and low-income people going into communities to service those who are able to telecommute,” Eric Adams, Brooklyn’s borough president, recently said. (About a hundred of the city’s public-transit workers have died of COVID-19 since the first M.T.A. worker death was reported, on March 26th.) And yet many essential workers have little choice but to stay on the job during the pandemic—either because they can’t afford to take time off or because they’re told that they aren’t allowed to. One study found that fifty-five per cent of retail and food-service workers, many of whom have been declared essential, have no paid sick leave, and fewer than ten per cent of them can take two weeks off—the recommended COVID-19 quarantine period.

The basic process by which doctors collect a medical history has not changed in a century. You start with a patient’s “chief complaint”—the primary reason for seeking medical care. You make your way through the “history of present illness,” exploring the onset, pace, character, and severity of symptoms. (When exactly did that cough start? What color is your phlegm? Does your chest hurt more when breathing deeply or walking quickly?) Then you move to preëxisting conditions, medications, and allergies.

Tucked somewhere down below is the social history. At its best, the social history is how we explore who patients are as individuals—how their jobs and hobbies and lives intersect with their current predicaments. It’s meant to illuminate how nonmedical factors may have contributed to illness, but also to give us a more complete understanding of what’s important to the person we’re caring for. For busy doctors, though, it’s often reduced to a few mechanical questions: Do you smoke? Drink alcohol? Do drugs? The entire social history in a doctor’s note might read, “No toxic habits.”

It’s turning out that, in this pandemic, social history is profoundly important. As we learn more about the epidemiology of the virus, I find myself exploring these details with great interest. Where do you live? How many rooms? How many people are in those rooms? Does your work require you to come in close contact with others? The answers reveal how much risk specific households and families are shouldering.

One of the many new faces in my hospital belongs to Khalid Haynes, a softspoken African-American man in his mid-twenties. COVID-19 has created administrative demands in addition to clinical ones; Haynes is one of many new patient coördinators who have arrived to keep the hospital running. (Other new hires have been helping to build new I.C.U.s, or transfer patients between facilities.) He began his career as a personal trainer, before starting work as a patient coördinator at an integrative-health clinic. There, he answered phones, greeted patients, and verified insurance; as the coronavirus began to spread across the city, his clinic turned to telemedicine, and he began working remotely. In late March, he received a call from his manager saying that he was being dispatched to the hospital as an essential worker. In his new role, he’d help troubleshoot and distribute iPads to doctors, so that their patients could see their families.

Haynes has kind eyes, horn-rimmed glasses, and an easygoing charm. During our first encounter, I rushed past in a pre-caffeine daze, and he stopped me to ask about my day, insisting on a genuine answer. Two weeks after he started at the hospital, his grandmother died of COVID-19. “That gave me a really painful perspective on how important this role is,” he told me. “I couldn’t see my grandmother before she died. I don’t want that to happen to anyone else.”",real

Updated at 5:50 p.m. ET



Public health officials closed a restaurant in Castle Rock, Colo., on Monday, one day after its owner hosted a Mother's Day event in which the entire dining room was open to seat customers — most of whom weren't wearing face masks.

Hundreds of people visited the C&C Coffee and Kitchen on Sunday, with some praising its defiance in allowing people to eat breakfast burritos and drink coffee at tables despite broad restrictions that limit Colorado restaurants to carryout service. Images from Sunday morning show the restaurant had a line of people at the door, with a crowd inside.

""I expected it to be busy. I never expected this,"" owner April Arellano told the Castle Rock News-Press on Sunday. ""I'm so happy so many people came out to support the Constitution and stand up for what is right. We did our time. We did our two weeks. We did more than two weeks ... and we were failing. We had to do something.""

But the local health department shut down the restaurant Monday, saying its owners had ignored a warning not to open their dining room.

""The restaurant was ordered to close immediately"" around midday Monday, the Tri-County Health Department said in a statement to NPR.

""It is disheartening that this restaurant has chosen to move ahead of the public orders and not even consider implementing best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., the health department's executive director.

In an apparent reference to the restaurant, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that like many Coloradans, he hasn't seen his mother in weeks — and he wasn't able to take her out on Mother's Day.

""I love my mom far too much to put her at risk by visiting a busy restaurant operating illegally, just to take a selfie with omelets and a mimosa,"" Polis said. He added, ""Colorado — America — we are better than that.""

Even before local officials took action, C&C Coffee and Kitchen received praise while others slammed it, depending on how they view the economic shutdowns triggered by efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

A video from inside the restaurant Sunday shows a morning rush, with a chattering crowd of families. As the camera sweeps through the packed dining room, only one person can be clearly seen wearing a protective mask.

The bustling business created the potential risk of a new nexus for more coronavirus cases, Douglas countered, something that shouldn't be done. Anything else, he added, isn't fair to business owners who are following Colorado's ""Safer at Home"" restrictions.

If the C&C Coffee and Kitchen doesn't obey state restrictions, it could lose its license, the health department said. But Douglas also said that if the restaurant agrees to follow the rules on takeout orders, the closure order will be lifted and it can resume operating.

Sunday's rogue opening prompted a flood of comments on the restaurant's Facebook page. Some congratulated Arellano for going against the restrictions, saying she was letting people decide if they wanted to gather in public.

""We had a lovely time and enjoyed the food yesterday!"" one woman wrote. ""Thank you for a breath of fresh air!""

Anyone who didn't agree, the restaurant's backers said, could simply stay away. But others disagreed vehemently, saying they would never patronize a restaurant that defies public health orders — and adding the potential dangers extend far beyond the people who opted to visit.

""So much selfish stupidity. If it was just themselves they were endangering I wouldn't care, but we're all connected. It's a pandemic and people are dying,"" a commenter wrote on member station Colorado Public Radio's Facebook post about the reopening.

Castle Rock, a small city about 30 miles south of Denver, is the county seat of Douglas County. It's in the jurisdiction of the Tri-County Health Department – which issued a reminder Saturday, urging people not to form groups of more than 10 on Mother's Day and to keep everyone at least 6 feet apart.

All Colorado restaurants have been under tight restrictions since March 17, when the state health department's order closing bars, restaurants, gyms, theaters and casinos took effect.

Arellano's decision to reopen her restaurant at full capacity came days after the governor extended the state's disaster emergency declaration through June 6. As Polis issued that order last week, he cited the threat of a disaster that could bring ""widespread or severe damage, injury or loss of life.""

On Friday, Polis said restaurants may be able to reopen by the time Memorial Day weekend arrives at the end of May, depending on the latest data about the coronavirus outbreak.

In a news conference Monday afternoon, Polis said a decision on opening restaurants will be made on May 25.",real

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s flag carrier Thai Airways International will file a plan for restructuring its business with the Central Bankruptcy Court, a government spokeswoman said Monday.

Narumon Pinyosinwat said the plan submitted by the State Enterprise Policy Office to salvage the airline will be submitted Tuesday to for Cabinet approval. She said she had no details of the plan.

Thai Airways had been suffering financially even before the coronavirus crisis brought travel and tourism in the country to a near standstill.

The coronavirus travel crisis shuttered these three US airlines. Will more go under as well?

The airline initially sought a $1.7 billion bailout loan from the government. There is speculation that its reorganization under bankruptcy could take the government’s ownership share below 50%, effecting a form of privatization. All rescue options were likely to lead in cuts in staff, fleet and flights.

Thai Airways logged losses of $374.3 million in 2019, $361.9 million in 2018 and $65.8 million in 2017.

Thai media reports say it is carrying a debt burden of almost $9.4 billion.

The airline stopped all its flights at the beginning of April as Thailand imposed strict precautions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Almost all its staff were put on leave at greatly reduced salaries. The government last week extended to the end of June a ban on arrivals on international passenger flights, ruling out their immediate resumption.",real

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Travelling has proven resilient after previous crises, which suggests that once a Covid-19 vaccine, treatment or other solution is found, antsy globetrotters will pack their Samsonites in nearly full force again. Notable changes are likely to be in health checks and corporate flyers.

The pandemic’s effects will undoubtedly linger. Count Warren Buffett, whose investment horizon is longer than most, among those worried that some changes to travel habits will endure. The billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate dumped its big stakes in four U.S. airlines amid the crisis.

There’s reason for concern. It took nearly two years for North American flight demand to return following the 9/11 attacks, according to Morgan Stanley research. Overnight stays abroad this year are expected to fall by 20% to 30% from 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, which would amount to a loss of up to $450 billion in receipts. After the global financial crisis in 2009, the comparable decline was a mere 4%.

Travellers probably will stay closer to home at first. Domestic driving vacations, for example, make more sense in many places while flights are grounded, and national borders closed. Before bigger vacations get planned, popular destination spots will have to reopen. With most of Walt Disney’s theme parks and other major attractions unavailable, there’s less incentive to embark on a journey anytime soon. Eventually, though, airlines, hoteliers and online booking sites should be able to start luring confined consumers back with tantalising discounts.

Costs will ultimately be on the rise, however. Airlines can expect lasting changes to their expense structures. Just as a single bomb threat forced passengers to remove their shoes before boarding, the virus is likely to usher in a mask-wearing era. Temperature checks, deeper cleaning of planes and new boarding protocols all will be more time-consuming and chew up money. Many middle seats also will be empty for a while, as Southwest Airlines boss Gary Kelly noted for his $16 billion discount carrier, forcing further financial recalibration. Roughly 77% of seats need to be filled for airlines to break even on an operating basis, according to the International Air Transportation Association trade group.

Some destinations also may fare better than others. Countries with better-developed healthcare systems, such as Switzerland and New Zealand, will be more appealing, providing even greater incentive to channel government stimulus funds into improving them now. At least some tourists are already thinking about their next itinerary. Embattled cruise operator Carnival, for one, said nearly half its passengers had opted for future credit instead of refunds on cancelled trips. The company is planning to restart some voyages in August.

There is other mildly encouraging evidence for the industry even though Expedia and others have withdrawn financial forecasts and Delta Air Lines boss Ed Bastian expects a recovery to take two to three years. Domestic bookings for China’s largest online travel agency, Trip.com, are on a rapid rise. Travellers in their teens and twenties are powering the $15 billion company’s first stage of a rebound in May, signalling that less risk-averse generations will help lead a post-pandemic age of tourism. Certain carriers, such as Ireland’s Ryanair, with more flexible cost structures also may be better able to navigate the crisis. More consolidation could be necessary and allowed.

Mobility will be more difficult, however. Countries wary of future contagion may tighten their borders and widen the scope of what constitutes non-essential travel. Leisure trips are also apt to become onerous. Health immunisation documents could become as vital as passports. Global air traffic, meanwhile, is expected to slow to a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% through 2028, from an estimated 5.1% before the crisis, according to UBS.

Business travel looks especially vulnerable. Such spending had been projected to reach $1.7 trillion worldwide by 2022, according to industry estimates. Serious concerns are evidenced, however, by two investors recently backing out of a proposed deal to buy a stake in a corporate airfare and hotel booking enterprise half-owned by American Express at a $5 billion valuation.

By the time the pandemic blows over, companies also will be more accustomed to remote working, and happy to keep costs down by using videoconferencing to meet with clients over first-class tickets and conference boondoggles. Even a modest 5% long-term hit to this segment of the market would upend many business strategies. For the beaten-up travel complex, this area will leave the most lasting scars.",real

The biggest one for many Americans is: When will life go back to normal? And, what will that new normal even look like? As summer approaches, you may find yourself longing for events that you would typically look forward to, such as vacations, holidays or time spent with your family. On social media, people who are currently sheltering in place expressed that it's challenging to not have anything to look forward to or anticipate. Without these usual benchmarks, you might feel off or sad. ""Uncertainty doesn't sit well,"" Kevin Antshel, clinical psychologist and director of the clinical psychology program at Syracuse University tells CNBC Make It. Here's how to cope with not knowing what's coming next.

Why humans hate the unknown

""The fear of the unknown is possibly the most fundamental fear of human beings,"" Antshel says. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have been able to survive because we're able to plan. We're socialized from childhood to believe that ""there's a predictable universe"" and order in which things should happen, Antshel says. ""Extraordinarily high levels of uncertainty are really against how we've advanced as human beings,"" he says. For example, under normal circumstances, you'd be able to assemble the resources necessary to achieve a plan, and then go implement it. ""When things don't make sense, or they run counter to what it typically is, then we experience these high levels of negative feelings,"" Antshel says.

What uncertainty feels like

We're hand-wired to avoid uncertainty, because it makes us feel lots of negative emotions, Antshel says. The ""vast majority"" of people are experiencing some level of emotional distress or unpleasant emotions during this time, he says. These feelings all come back to uncertainty. ""Fear and anxiety really run hand-in-hand: The more things are uncertain, the more we're going to fear, and the more we fear things, the more we are anxious,"" he says. While planning for post-pandemic life can feel comforting, thinking too much about the future can also increase our anxious thoughts. The more prolonged anxiety is, the more likely it is to manifest itself as depression, which is characterized by a loss of interest in things, hopelessness and helplessness, he says. It can feel like this difficult period will be going on forever, with no end in sight. On top of this, you might find that you're mourning the loss of events that you were anticipating, such as weddings, big work projects or graduation.

Here's what you need to know if you're planning to buy or sell a home this year.","A report by Realtor.com predicts that home sales will rebound in July, August, and September as buyers return to the market, but will turn negative again in the final months of the year due to another forecasted spike in coronavirus cases.

In addition, mortgage rates are predicted to drop to record lows, to below 3% by the end of 2020, but will come with stricter requirements.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Home sales are in for a rocky ride for the remainder of 2020, according to a new forecast by Realtor.com.

Realtor.com's chief economist, Danielle Hale, predicted that home sales will rebound in July, August, and September, as buyers return to the market.

However, she said she believes they will drop again in the final months of the year as secondary waves of coronavirus infections continue to spread throughout the US and the unemployment rate remains high.

Overall, existing home sales are predicted to see a 15% year-over-year decrease by the end of 2020, while home prices flatten nationally due to buyer interest in the secondary market, according to the report.

""The US housing market started 2020 with substantial momentum. With some of the best home sales and housing starts in more than a decade, our biggest challenge going into the spring home-buying season was a lack of for sale homes. The coronavirus pandemic has kept both buyers and sellers on the sidelines, preserving market balance, for now,"" Hale was quoted saying in the report. ""As cities and states begin the slow process of reopening, we're going to see a see-saw recovery with ups and downs that will favor the nation's secondary markets in the short-term.""

The sharp nosedive in number of new listings exacerbates the issue of a lack of inventory, which has been evident since the start of the pandemic. In the last week of March, new listings were down 36.9% from the same time last year. For the week ending April 17, that decline had spiked to nearly 50%, according to Redfin, while Realtor.com reported that new listings were down 39% for the week ending May 2.

Realtor.com explained that while the market will continue to see constricted inventory, buyer demand is expected to be inconsistent as many will likely pull back during the second wave of the outbreak. On a national level, home prices are expected to increase just 1.1% for 2020, with possible small declines by the end of the year, meaning there won't be many deals for buyers or sellers in this market.

Mortgages rates are predicted to drop below 3% by the end of 2020

According to Realtor.com, mortgage rates are forecasted to hit record lows below 3% by the end of the year. But mortgages will be harder to get, too.

""Although rates will be favorable, the qualifying criteria will be tougher than normal as lenders seek to mitigate their own risks amid the unfolding economic uncertainty globally. The stricter qualifying criteria will require buyers to have higher credit scores in addition to more cash for down payments,"" the report reads.

Housingwire has reported that as the outbreak worsened, lenders have already raised lending standards and access to Federal Housing Administration loans has dried up. In fact, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that mortgage credit availability was down in April to its lowest level since 2014.

""Buyers should expect periods of very low inventory turnover, especially if subsequent COVID-19 flare-ups occur, creating a 'what you see is what you get' environment. In some areas, buyers may find sellers leaning heavily on digital technology, such as virtual tours, instead of hosting traditional open houses. Determined buyers may need to be prepared to pull the trigger on a home sight unseen,"" the report reads.

But it's not all bad news for buyers. Realtor.com predicts that due to the likelihood of stable home prices, there will be less all-cash offers from investors to compete with which, according to the report, dominated the market back in 2008.

And, in some good news for current homeowners, Fannie Mae has forecast that the low rates will lead to more refinancings than any time in the past seven years.",real

Well, first of all, we're not getting all the statistics. I mean, we get like in Mississippi, 80 percent of the people in one area that died from COVID-19. It might be we're not as shocked because we weren't dealing with it before. And we weren't shocked when a quarter million people were dying from poverty and no income.

You know, we weren't shocked enough when the Supreme Court rolled back the Voting Rights Act and it's 2013. We've had less voting rights than we've had since 1965. And McConnell, for instance, has blocked fixing the Voting Rights Act for over two thousand days.

We weren't really shocked as a nation when we knew before COVID, sixty two million people got up and will work every day without a living wage. Four million people could get up every morning and buy unleaded gas and not buy unleaded water. We were spending 53 cents of every discretionary dollar on the military and less than fifteen cents of every discretion dollar on education, infrastructure and health care.

Our consciousness has and moral consciousness has been so dulled right and we've been locked in this Reaganism, locked in this trickle down, locked in this neo-liberalism. And this and we've been locked in this left right debate. This what the reality of poverty and low income is not about left and right. It's about the very soul at the heart of this of this nation and that we are not upholding even our constitutional morality.

I'm a preacher. But beyond the preaching part, establishment of justice provided for the common defense, promoting the general welfare issue and domestic tranquility, equal protection under the law. When you look at these glaring statistics, even before COVID, we weren't shocked.

So after COVID, some people still think it's other, it's over there. I'm concerned even and I say this as an African-American that we are not getting the data on poverty. We're not getting the data on zip code. I believe when we get the full data we're going to see yes it is killing African-Americans at enormous levels, but it's also killing poor white folk in Appalachia at enormous levels and they don't have what they need.

That's why we have been pulling together this poor people's campaign, a national call for a moral revival over the last three years, because we recognized years ago America needed a moral revival, a moral revolution of values. If we have a conscious awakening, a shaking, a restarting of the very heart of our nation because we are in trouble when it comes to our consciousness.

According to UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given his full support to his senior adviser Dominic Cummings after reports emerged that he travelled 400 km (250 miles) to northern England with COVID-19 symptoms.

""I can tell you that the PM provides Mr Cummings with his full support"", Mr Shapps said.

Earlier, The Guardian and the Daily Mirror published a joint investigation which revealed that Cummings took a trip to his parents' house in Durham just a day after he confirmed that he had been self-isolating with COVID-19 symptoms.

Following the report, the British government issued a statement saying that Cummings did not break coronavirus lockdown guidelines when he took the journey as he made it to ensure that his young son could be properly cared for.

Following the incident, Mr Cummings has faced backlash and calls for resignation, but answering questions from reporters, the prime minister's right hand said that he will ""obviously not"" step down.

""You guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?"" Cummings said.

UK Labour Party Calls for Inquiry Into Cummings' Lockdown Trip

Meanwhile, the UK's opposition Labour Party has called for an urgent inquiry into Cummings' reported lockdown trip.

""The British people have made important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including being away from family in times of need. It is therefore vital that the government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been adhering to the same rules as everyone else"", Rachel Reeves, Labour's cabinet office minister in waiting, stated.

Previously, after the report of the incident emerged, it gave the opposition a handle to call on Johnson to sack Cummings, saying that the lockdown rules made it clear that those with suspected COVID-19 symptoms should isolate with their whole household.

The UK guidelines suggest that people should stay at home and refrain from visiting family members unless they need essentials, such as food or medication.",fake

H. Chan School of Public Health, has devoted her professional life to studying malaria and other infectious diseases. As news of a novel coronavirus emerged from China, Buckee realized that her area of expertise—how infectious diseases evolve as they move through vulnerable populations—would be valuable to health-care workers and elected officials as the virus spread across the globe. “The methods and the tools are the same, and epidemiological models are easily adapted,” Buckee told me. “But, for many of us, like me, we work with endemic pathogens. COVID-19 is new. There is so much we don’t know.” Since the most urgent imperative was to “flatten the curve” of infections, it was crucial to know where public-health strategies like stay-at-home orders were working and where they were not. Buckee quickly assembled a consortium of infectious-disease researchers to make the data accessible to policymakers—data that they did not yet have.

At just about the same time, Ian Allen, a former marine and C.I.A. paramilitary officer, cold-called Harvard’s School of Public Health and asked if there was anything that his new company, Camber Systems, could do to help with the pandemic. Soon afterward, Allen was connected with Buckee, the associate director of the School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Buckee had created the COVID-19 Mobility Data Network, a network of epidemiologists from universities around the world, to try to track the efficacy of social-distancing measures. Allen agreed to provide Buckee with the software to query and scrub data collected by tech companies and use it to track the coronavirus’s spread without violating Americans’ privacy. “I wasn’t really expecting ever to hear back, assuming that Harvard, of all places, would have all the resources they’d ever need,” Allen told me, while standing in a field in rural Virginia as his son shot at tin cans with a BB gun. (Like many parents, Allen has been homeschooling his children during the pandemic; this was geometry class.) “Caroline asked me if we could help aggregate location data. Just aggregating the data and anonymizing it in the right way to protect privacy would take some of the burden off of her.” Allen reached out to a handful of data firms, including Unacast, Kochava, and X-Mode. All agreed to provide their data for free.

Camber Systems, of which Allen is the C.E.O., is a year-old startup that, among other things, hopes to offer federal, state, and local government agencies ways to use commercially harvested location data to improve their operations without violating privacy laws. Shortly before the pandemic, Allen and his business partner, Navin Vembar, a mathematician who served as the chief technology officer of the General Services Administration, were searching for potential clients, talking with officials in Madison, Wisconsin, about using location data to shore up tourism and distribute the city’s public resources equitably. Assisting Buckee’s COVID-19 Mobility Data Network was the kind of project they envisioned when they launched their company with Hangar, a venture-capital firm that funds companies that use technology in the public interest.

By presenting aggregated location data in an accessible and searchable format for epidemiologists studying COVID-19, the project would enable researchers and policymakers to see how members of the public move around their communities. When paired with other metrics, such as the number of new infections or mortality rates, the data would guide policymakers as they grappled with when and where to lift stay-at-home orders. Facebook is also supplying the network with data. According to Buckee, correspondence between the various groups gives researchers confidence in the trends they are seeing. “One data set is not going to show what’s going on,” she said.

Location data are the bread and butter of “ad tech.” They let marketers know you recently shopped for running shoes, are trying to lose weight, and have an abiding affection for kettle corn. Apps on cell phones emit a constant trail of longitude and latitude readings, making it possible to follow consumers through time and space. Location data are often triangulated with other, seemingly innocuous slivers of personal information—so many, in fact, that a number of data brokers claim to have around five thousand data points on almost every American. It’s a lucrative business—by at least one estimate, the data-brokerage industry is worth two hundred billion dollars. Though the data are often anonymized, a number of studies have shown that they can be easily unmasked to reveal identities—names, addresses, phone numbers, and any number of intimacies. As Buckee knew, public-health surveillance, which serves the community at large, has always bumped up against privacy, which protects the individual. But, in the past, public-health surveillance was typically conducted by contract tracing, with health-care workers privately interviewing individuals to determine their health status and trace their movements. It was labor-intensive, painstaking, memory-dependent work, and, because of that, it was inherently limited in scope and often incomplete or inefficient. (At the start of the pandemic, there were only twenty-two hundred contact tracers in the country.)

Digital technologies, which work at scale, instantly provide detailed information culled from security cameras, license-plate readers, biometric scans, drones, G.P.S. devices, cell-phone towers, Internet searches, and commercial transactions. They can be useful for public-health surveillance in the same way that they facilitate all kinds of spying by governments, businesses, and malign actors. South Korea, which reported its first COVID-19 case a month after the United States, has achieved dramatically lower rates of infection and mortality by tracking citizens with the virus via their phones, car G.P.S. systems, credit-card transactions, and public cameras, in addition to a robust disease-testing program. Israel enlisted Shin Bet, its secret police, to repurpose its terrorist-tracking protocols. China programmed government-installed cameras to point at infected people’s doorways to monitor their movements.

As unlikely as it may seem that such privacy-compromising measures will be adopted in the United States, the Trump Administration reportedly summoned tech executives to the White House to discuss sharing data with the government. Not much is known about the meeting. The Administration has classified all its discussions about COVID-19, and it later denounced Politico for reporting that the White House was in talks with tech firms to create a national coronavirus surveillance system. Last week, Gizmodo reported that Palantir, a secretive data-analytics firm owned by the conservative billionaire and the Trump backer Peter Thiel, has a contract from the Trump Administration to build a database to track the spread of the virus. Palantir is best known for its work with the N.S.A. and ICE, where its software is used to track undocumented immigrants. (Other private surveillance companies, most notably the Israeli firm NSO, are also pitching COVID-19 tracing to governments around the world.)

“We’re all too familiar with the historical record of crises, where new powers in the hands of governments and corporations lead to them holding on to them indefinitely,” Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with the digital-rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. Schwartz pointed out that most of the sweeping investigative powers given to the intelligence community after the 9/11 terrorist attack are still in place nearly two decades later. As Senator Maria Cantwell wrote, on April 9th, in her opening remarks for a paper hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on the role of Big Tech during the pandemic, “Rights and data surrendered temporarily during an emergency can become very difficult to get back.”

As difficult as it is now to look ahead, lawmakers like Cantwell and privacy advocates like Schwartz are asking us to think about how much privacy we are willing to sacrifice to combat a rampaging virus. If we accept government data tracking, the surveillance necessary to curtail COVID-19 could become a permanent fixture in our lives. It’s an unknowable trade-off. “In this particular case, if we have technology for minimizing harm, we have a moral obligation to use it,” Marcello Ienca, a bioethicist at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, told me. “But we have to merge it with the best available technology in the areas of cybersecurity and privacy.” To do this right, Ienca added, the public-health experts need to work with privacy advocates.",real
962,1941,https://newspunch.com/obamas-portrait-will-never-hang-in-trumps-white-house-liberals-outraged/,2020-05-23,Obama’s Portrait Will Never Hang in Trump White House – Liberals Outraged,"Former President Barack Obama’s portrait will not be gracing a White House wall anytime soon, and the mainstream media is blaming President Donald Trump.

Traditionally, an official commissioned portrait of the last president is unveiled in an East Room ceremony by the current president, who makes polite remarks about his predecessor before adding the painting to the collection of portraits of former presidents.

But according to NBC News, however, neither Trump nor former President Barack Obama is interested in participating in this tradition that goes back decades.

But these two are not just any presidents: They have had a highly contentious public relationship.

WesternJournal report: Recently, Obama took the opportunity of video commencement addresses to take shots at Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

For his part, Trump has been vocal about the Obama administration’s role in unmasking the identity of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in a scandal dubbed “Obamagate.”

“You’ve got a president who’s talking about putting the previous one in legal jeopardy, to put it nicely,” presidential historian Michael Beschloss told NBC News.

“We have not seen a situation like that in history,” he said. “It takes antipathy of a new president for a predecessor to a new level.”

Despite how Beschloss described it, people close to the matter reportedly confirmed that Obama would not be interested in taking part in the ceremony as long as Trump was president, meaning the former president’s portrait could remain absent until 2025 if Trump is re-elected.

Trump apparently wasn’t disappointed to nix the event either, according to those same sources.

Still, liberals are furious at the supposed attack on Obama’s honor.

NBC and MSNBC legal analyst Maya Wiley blamed the absence of the ceremony on — you guessed it — Trump’s racism.

“So #Trump, who stoked ‘birtherism’ lunacy v the first Black #POTUS, was sued 4 house discrimination & vilified ppl of color won’t hang #Obama portrait. Anyone surprised?” she wrote on Twitter.

So #Trump, who stoked “birtherism” lunacy v the first Black #POTUS, was sued 4 house discrimination & vilified ppl of color won’t hang #Obama portrait. Anyone surprised? “White House portrait ceremony may be the latest casualty of the political divide” https://t.co/tVD61hVbLl — Maya Wiley (@mayawiley) May 19, 2020

In a move that was as predictable as the sunrise, CNN also implied that Trump’s supposed snub was racially motivated, but it seems at the very least to be a mutual decision if not completely one-sided on the part of Obama.

The Obamas had unveiled their Smithsonian portraits in 2018, which were widely ridiculed at the time for their stylized portrayals of the couple, but the official White House presidential portrait is a completely separate commissioned work of art.

According to The Hill, the former president and first lady secured and signed an artist as per the usual procedure for the official portrait, but the process stopped there as neither Obama has yet to sit for their paintings.

If that report is true, it may indicate the decision was mainly Obama’s because, after all, a painting that does not exist cannot be unveiled.

“Finally! Obama makes a decision that is good for America,” actor James Woods tweeted.

Finally! Obama makes a decision that is good for America… https://t.co/1u3KFBwGZg — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) May 19, 2020

Regardless of who was responsible, Obama’s media cronies are always concerned about his legacy, often citing the ridiculous myth that his presidency was scandal-free in an attempt to bolster his image, so blaming Trump plays well into their established narrative.

On the other hand, it is fun to imagine Obama, a president who relished being in the company of celebrities, to edge his way into their spotlight, mulling whether it would be better to forgo his portrait ceremony to “rob” Trump of that honor if that is, in fact, what happened.

Regardless of how this situation came about, it is satisfying to know that Obama’s portrait will not have a place in the White House as long as Trump is president.

That must be infuriating to the leftists who treasure Obama as their dear leader, and would make Trump’s potential re-election a doubly painful prospect.

And surely, Trump and his supporters wouldn’t want it any other way.",fake
978,178,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21193904/instagram-therapy-live-sessions-covid-19-coronavirus-posts-influencers,2020-03-27,"Instagram therapists, and their DMs, are open for business","Instagram Live therapy sessions can be jarring. An iPhone ping occasionally goes off, the therapist forgets to turn off the press conference she was watching before going live, or the sound drops out momentarily. Even beyond the technical difficulties, watching an influencer chat with her therapist feels intrusive and wrong, but, eventually, as the Live levels out and everything works as it should, the therapist can get to the nitty-gritty. Conversation flows, and viewers get to benefit from hearing another person’s anxieties expressed out loud.

Influencer Katie Sands and her therapist Stephanie Lesk started weekly live chats last week for Sands’ more than 200,000 followers. They discuss COVID-19 and the realities of working and living through a pandemic. They talk about financial stress and how strange everything is right now — presumably, feelings other people are working through, too.

Other therapists began bringing COVID-19 content to Instagram a few weeks ago, and as more countries around the world started telling residents to stay home, the volume of accounts posting outbreak-oriented advice grew. Therapists across the US are now offering virtual sessions, open workshops, opening their DMs up for questions, and partnering with influencers to get their messages out. They’re trying to find a way to bring calm to a severely stressful and anxiety-inducing pandemic, especially for people who can’t afford their own therapist.

“Why not have a conversation about it and just kind of allow people in the room to say, ‘Look, we’ve got to make choices here [about] how we want to move through this thing,’” Lesk said. “You have to find some way to take control of this thing.”

Direct contact with a therapist is one option, and Instagram offers a way for therapists and clients to connect. Jamie Castillo, who leads the Arizona-based therapy group Find Your Shine, piloted a virtual support group for Arizona residents this week, advertising it on her popular Instagram account. The group gives people a place to “focus on self-soothing strategies and empowerment, rather than talking about the pandemic and perpetuating fear.” It costs $20 per person.

“During this time, we’re going to also try and delicately talk about the silver lining that we can take in terms of increasing empathy for people around us and focusing on the collective good versus every man for himself kind of mentality,” she says.

Castillo’s Instagram account also offers supportive posts and advice on topics such as infertility, relationship conflict, and trauma. But recently, her posts have a different, more targeted purpose: helping people through quarantine. She only addresses COVID-19 by name several times while the rest of her posts center on the idea of cancellations, social distancing, and media overexposure.

“What’s cool with Instagram is to obviously not act as a replacement for therapy, but to kind of close those gaps and reduce those barriers that people all over the world face when it comes to getting mental health care,” Castillo says. Her posts can’t apply to everyone at once, “but people have said the posts make them think about things in a different way or encourage them to give themselves grace.”

Instagram also allows therapists to share how they’re able to help, says Alyssa Lia Mancao, a therapist in Los Angeles. “People normally see therapists as kind of this thing that happens behind closed doors,” she says. “You don’t really know what’s going on; you don’t really know what it’s like. It’s something that we don’t talk about as much as we should.”

Mancao pivoted her content to topics that speak more directly to the crisis. The pandemic pushed her to go live on her own page where she took questions from viewers, and she’s planning to take over the Stories of a separate, finance-oriented account, The Financial Diet, to reach its followers and give mental health tips.

“Most [therapists] aren’t taking any new clients right now and don’t want to start out a relationship through a video,” Mancao said. “Being able to provide at least this information through Instagram, it’s really helpful for the people who haven’t had the luxury to be in therapy and get to therapy right now.”

Governments and organizations have recognized how important mental health is during this crisis, too. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this week that more than 6,000 mental health professionals signed up to assist people via a public hotline, which he encouraged people to call into to talk through their feelings. UNICEF published an article highlighting ways in which teenagers can care for their mental health.

Other therapists are using Instagram to advertise their services, knowing there’s a need. Instagram gives therapists the ability to market themselves and their messages widely, making it an important platform for independent therapists trying to find new clients.

Hilary Weinstein, a therapist in New York City, has advertised on influencers’ pages before and has started doing so again as she plans to expand her practice. In the past, she reached out to meme accounts, like @sobasicicanteven, and offered to pay them to share posts advertising her services. This time around, she’s doing the same thing. We Met At Acme, a popular Instagram account and podcast, reposted her because of a partnership. She says these posts have resulted in many people reaching out to her, although with insurance and figuring out whether they’re a good match, that number can dwindle.

Online therapy had already been growing, Weinstein says, and the pandemic’s unknown length will help it grow. “That kind of sparked a lot of anxiety in and of itself, like how long am I going to have to be alone and be alone with my thoughts?” Weinstein says. “That’s never healthy, especially so for extended periods of time, so I think it just really lends itself to the whole teletherapy trend that was kind of on the rise anyway.”

Instagram therapy isn’t a substitute for an actual person giving care, these therapists say, but it’s a step toward destigmatizing mental health, and it gives people a clearer idea of how they can care for themselves during this challenging time.

“A lot of people feel ready to go to therapy, but not a lot of people have the privilege, you know, financially, [they] can’t go to therapy,” Mancao says. “There’s so much stigma about therapy in different cultures and different families, but I think that being able to follow a therapist on Instagram bridges that barrier and really helps people connect to information that they probably wouldn’t have otherwise.”",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

Fremont is located in Alameda County, however, which said in a statement that it’s still under shelter-in-place. Bloomberg was first to report on the emails sent from CEO Elon Musk and Tesla HR boss Valerie Capers Workman.

Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, doesn’t see it quite the same way. “We have not said that it’s appropriate to move forward,” Erica Pan, Alameda County’s health officer, said about Tesla, according to Bloomberg. The county told Tesla it didn’t meet criteria to reopen, Bloomberg reported.

Although California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday that manufacturing industries can start to reopen in the state, his guidance does not override county-level restrictions, according to CNBC.

That didn’t stop Tesla’s Musk from jumping on the opportunity:

“In light of Governor Newsom’s statement earlier today approving manufacturing in California, we will aim to restart production in Fremont tomorrow afternoon. I will be on the line personally helping wherever I can. However, if you feel uncomfortable coming back to work at this time, please do not feel obligated to do so. These are difficult times, so thanks very much for working hard to make Tesla successful!”

Tesla’s Fremont plant had been (mostly) idle since March 23rd in compliance with a shelter-in-place order, just as it was beginning to deliver its new Model Y car. Musk has been a vocal critic of California’s lockdown orders, arguing they violate constitutional rights.

981,1890,https://www.studyfinds.org/survey-2-in-5-adults-feel-theyve-changed-for-the-better-thanks-to-coronavirus-lockdown/,2020-05-23,Silver Lining: 2 In 5 Adults Have ‘Changed For The Better’ Thanks To Lockdown,"LONDON — Many people have been using their extra time during the coronavirus lockdown wisely and have adopted new habits to keep themselves busy. In fact, a recent survey of 2,000 British adults reveals that 43% of people feel they’ve “changed their ways for the better” as a result of all the time inside these past few months.

Researchers sought to learn how habits and daily lives have changed as a result of the lockdown. Nearly half of those surveyed expect to keep up these new hobbies, skills, and daily habits they’ve taken on after the lockdown restrictions are lifted. Learning new computer skills, creating podcasts, participating in online fitness classes and going for long walks are some of the new activities people have turned to as a new means to occupy their time.

The survey, commissioned by LG Electronics, shows that 43% of respondents feel they have “changed their ways for the better” as a result of the lockdown. For example, about two in five feel their new habits have helped their overall well-being. A quarter of adults say these activities have taught them new ways to relax. They hope to continue to be their improved selves once everyone returns to their old routines.

“The fact that many people are forming productive and healthy new habits is testament to the nation’s ability to adjust,” says Hanju Kim, IT product director at LG UK, in a statement. “The nation is working from home and has an appetite to continue working flexibly even after offices reopen. A big part of this can be attributed to technology keeping us connected.”

People have become increasingly reliant on technology during the time spent cooped up at home. Families are spending more time together watching movies, while others are turning to online classes to learn new skills like computer programming or a new language. That said, 54% of respondents feel their laptops are critical to getting by right now, while 64% say their cellphones have become a “lifeline” of sorts. Nearly six in ten (57%) wouldn’t know what to do if they didn’t have their TVs.

One of the most important uses of technology these days, of cousre, is the video call. People who have been using programs like FaceTime, Zoom, or Skype to keep in touch with friends and family report that they are connecting with their loved ones even more (45%) during lockdown than they did before restrictions were put in place. Video calls are now commonplace for virtual birthday parties (25%), bar trivia games (20%) and virtual bachelor/bachelorette parties (7%). The survey found that the average person spends almost three hours on video calls each week!

Half of the people surveyed are still working during the shutdown and have transformed their homes into their offices. Most people use at least two different rooms during the workday to give themselves a change of scenery. A quarter of people surveyed plan to spend more time working from home after their offices open back up.

One fifth of those surveyed have enjoyed the extra sleep they’ve been getting so much that they plan to maintain their extended sleep schedule moving forward.

The survey found a few more things of note. Over 25% of people surveyed think their spending habits have improved as a result of the shutdown. When asked what their ideal workspace would be once the lockdown ends, 30% of Brits said their home, 23% said a regular office space and 7% said outside spaces. Lastly, over one quarter of Brits surveyed find it easier to relax during the shutdown.

The survey was conducted by OnePoll.

EU leaders have responded with frustration to the UK’s plan for a quarantine regime that will require arrivals in the country to self-isolate for 14 days.

UK Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed on Friday that anyone arriving in the UK - including nationals returning from holidays abroad - from June 8 would be required under UK law to stay at home for 14 days or risk being hit with fines of £1,000.

France has responded by saying that it “regretted” the UK’s decision and will impose a “reciprocal measure.” It was initially reported that France and other EU countries could be exempt from any UK quarantine regime, however it was confirmed this week that would not be the case.

A spokesman for France’s Interior Ministry has been widely quoted as saying that, “we take note of the British government’s decision and we regret it. France is ready to put in place a reciprocal measure as soon as the system comes into force on the British side.”

Italy, once Europe’s Coronavirus capital, has also called for the UK to reconsider its position and said that together with the EU it should strike a “coordinated approach” to lifting lockdowns.

Raffaele Trombetta, the Italian Ambassador to the UK seemed to take a jab at Britain’s go it alone approach in an interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, saying that, “we believe that this pandemic is a global problem so the best thing to do is to tackle it with a coordinated approach.”

Mr Trombetta highlighted Italy’s plan to lift quarantine rules for those arriving from the UK to the EU as of June 3.

“We had 40 million trips from the UK to Italy last year. We know how much they love Italy. We are still open, welcoming them. We have made it clear what we are going to do and it’s important for British people to know that they can come to Italy. We understand that the UK’s new rules will be assessed after three weeks so hopefully there will be an easing of the measures as we are doing in Italy.”

Priti Patel announced the stringent new UK measures during the daily Coronavirus press conference in Downing Street on Friday, May 22.

“We are following the science and introducing public health measures that are supported by SAGE. This will require international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days – that is the incubation period of the virus so that if people have become infected overseas, we can limit the spread of the virus at home,” Patel said.

“And as we are taking this action, we are taking it at a time when it will be the most effective. Passengers arrivals have been down by 99% compared to the previous year. Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases, triggering an insurgence of this deadly disease,” she added.

According to the UK Home Office, travellers will reportedly be required to provide their contact information and officials will carry out checks to ensure that individuals are complying with the new rules. Those in self-isolation will not be permitted to have visitors and should not go out to buy essentials if they are able to rely on others to do so for them. Patel also revealed a list of 39 categories of people who would be exempt from the new rules, including healthcare workers, pilots and those coming from Ireland.

The British government has said that the new measures would be reviewed every three weeks.

The travel industry has also panned the UK government’s new quarantine measures, with Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, describing them as “unenforceable.”

“This isolation measure simply does not work unless passengers arriving in international UK airports are detained in airport terminals or hotels for the 14-day period. Once these arriving passengers have travelled on the crowded London Underground, or the Heathrow and Gatwick Express, or buses or taxis to their destination, the subsequent quarantine is pointless,” a Ryanair spokesman has been widely quoted as saying.",fake

Why it matters: The virus doesn't care about politics or geography. High-risk behavior in places where the virus is spreading is the recipe for an outbreak.

Map courtesy of the Brookings Institute. Note: High-risk counties are counties with at least 100 cases per 100,000 residents, as of May 17.

The big picture: For the last four weeks, counties newly designated as having a high prevalence of coronavirus cases — meaning at least 100 cases per 100,000 people — were more likely to have voted for President Trump than Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a recent analysis by the Brookings Institution.

The most recently identified counties tend to be in the South and the Midwest.

Between March 29 and May 17, the portion of Americans living in high-prevalence counties rose from 8% to 79%.

What they're saying: ""This suggests that rhetoric from some of the president’s supporters against maintaining public health measures may become more muted, as the nation continues to grapple with the many unknowns about COVID-19’s continued spread,"" writes William Frey, the author of the analysis.

Yes, but: That's not happening.

Republicans are more willing than Democrats or independents to partake in activities that involve interacting with other people, per new polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Two-thirds of Republicans said either that the pandemic isn't a major problem or that the ""worst is behind us."" On the other hand, 70% of Democrats and half of independents said that the ""the worst is yet to come.""

“Are you here for the haircut?’’ she asked.

He was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chairin the living room.

Soft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.

“You’ve got a great set up here,’’ he said.

It’s also illegal — and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.

In Texas, Shelley Luther was arrested after she defied an order to close her salon during the COVID-19 outbreak. She spent two days in jail and was fined $7,000.

In Michigan, Karl Manke's professional and business licenses were suspended after he refused to close his barbershop. Manke, 77, was charged with two criminal misdemeanors for defying the governor’s stay-at-home orders.

In California, the state has threatened disciplinary action against open salons and said it is investigating 651 related complaints. The city of Los Angeles has filed criminal complaints against four hair salons and one barbershop — along with 55 other businesses — that were open in violation of the city’s Safer at Home orders, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said last week.

Also last week, the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health in New York announced that a barber had tested positive for COVID-19 after cutting hair after the state put shutdown orders in place.

The number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers’ homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.

Financial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.

“Do I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?’’ said Harris, 38. “Or do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I’m thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?’’

There is no legal ambiguity in the state.

""California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,’’ Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.

But the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.

Last week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.

5,000 miles away, stylists are worried

In Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.

“It’s such a divisive issue, right?’’ said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. “Our members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, ‘Hey, it’s too soon, let’s wait and make things safe.’ And the other half is, ‘Let’s go-go-go-go.’ “

The sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.

Upon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.

The choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.

After Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon à la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther’s $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.

She received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called “Courage to Stand.’’

On May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.

“My attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,’’ said Luther, 46. “Even if it’s just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.

“Right now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we’re getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.’’

Manke did not reply to interview requests.

'Everything is super clean'

In an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.

One of Harris’s roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.

“Everything is super clean,’’ Harris said of her makeshift salon.

But it’s unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.

“The Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,’’ the post read. “If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.’’

But last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man’s hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.

In Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.

Dedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Mississippi on March 15. Eugene Edwards was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed, according to Dedra Edwards.

She said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.

“I know they’re using masks,’’ Dedra Edwards said. “But you don’t know the client you’re working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.’’

Safety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.

“Tell me, what’s safer,” Jones said, “having (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''

After entering Harris’s home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.

She is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she’s working at a Floyd’s 99 Barbershop.

Working with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.

“You look good,’’ she said.

Batinovich smiled.

“I feel good,’’ he said.",real

Now, some will have to give the money back","Weeks after Northwestern Medicine’s chief executive sent a laudatory email to his entire workforce announcing that employees were being awarded bonuses for remaining on the front lines during the COVID-19 crisis, some of those workers were informed Thursday that they were no longer eligible and the extra cash they were set to receive would ultimately be taken back.

“Recognizing the disproportionate burden of the COVID-19 pandemic to our employees who provide patient care in our hospitals and emergency departments, [Northwestern] will initiate a special compensation program, retroactive to April 5, 2020, through the lifting of the Illinois stay-at-home order or such other time as [Northwestern] determines it is no longer required,” Dean Harrison wrote April 17.

But on Thursday, a day before employees were set to receive their first paychecks with the extra cash, some received another email from an administrator explaining that they were now deemed ineligible for the program. Employees who mostly deal with inpatients still qualify for the bonuses, though workers “that spend the majority of their time with patients coming in for outpatient procedures are not eligible,” according to the email obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.

While those employees would still receive a bump in pay Friday, the email made it clear that the money would eventually be clawed back by their employer.

An employee at a suburban hospital, who asked to remain anonymous fearing she may be fired for speaking out, said she and her co-workers believe they’re set to receive an extra $5 an hour in their paychecks on Friday. Nevertheless, the money will now be taken out of her next check on May 22.

“It’s like giving a kid a piece of candy, and just as they start to put it in their mouth, you’re just ripping it out of their hands,” said the worker. “It is very cruel. It’s unbelievable.”

She was among the employees caught off guard by Thursday’s email from Sara Williamson, Northwestern’s director of access, who wrote that hospital officials “have come to understand that a smaller population of our team qualifies than what we originally thought.”

“I feel very strongly that this does not reflect your work efforts during this time, your contributions to the organization or my appreciation of your work,” she wrote. “Rather, this is something we need to do to ensure we are applying these pay practices in an equitable way across the organization.”

“There is extraordinary work going on that we may not be recognizing in a monetary way, but a lot of thought continues to go on about how we can continue to recognize all of [the] work and efforts during this time.”

Chris King, a spokesman for Northwestern, blamed payroll errors caused by “the expedited implementation process and interpretations of the qualification guidelines.”

“As always, we will follow up directly with the employees impacted,” King said. “We are proud of the exceptional work happening every day across our health system to care for patients during this global pandemic.

Meanwhile, the suburban hospital employee was still seething.

“You should just be ashamed of yourselves to do something like that,” she said of her bosses.",real

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act enabled the IRS to hand out $1,200 to Americans earning up to $75,000 a year, $2,400 to married couples who jointly file and make less than $150,000 year, and another $500 for every child under the age of 17.

But the payments can only go to taxpayers who have a Social Security number, leaving so-called “mixed-status” families behind. An exception was made for military families.

Chicago immigration attorneys Lana Nassar and Vivian Khalaf have filed a federal lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of an unnamed man who didn’t receive a stimulus check because he filed taxes with a spouse without a Social Security number.

Nassar and Khalaf seek class action status to include an estimated 1.2 million Americans who are married to immigrants who lack Social Security numbers and their citizen children.

About 6,000 citizens have signed up to become part of the case, including more than 1,500 in Illinois, Khalaf said during a virtual news conference Tuesday.

“There are many things in the law that are in the gray area. This is black and white. This is a constitutional violation of United States citizens,” Nassar said.

The news conference was organized by members of the Illinois congressional delegation.

U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., said the CARES Act excluded more than 3,700 Illinois families from receiving a stimulus check. “No one should be discriminated against for who they chose to marry [and] no child should be deprived of the financial aid they need during the pandemic. Doing so is cruel and inhumane,” he said.

“This is not just a Latinx issue,” said Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill. “There are U.S. citizens that are married to immigrants from countries all over the world. Right now, we are talking about an issue about basic fairness, plain and simple,” she said.

Communities in the Chicago area with high numbers of immigrants like Cicero, Little Village and Belmont Cragin have also recorded high numbers of COVID-19 cases.

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

The announcement comes after days of back-and-forth with the local authorities about whether the company was exempt from a recent shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area. Tesla will also suspend most operations at its solar panel factory in Buffalo, New York.

“Despite taking all known health precautions, continued operations in certain locations has caused challenges for our employees, their families and our suppliers,” the company wrote in a press release. “As such, we have decided to temporarily suspend production” at both factories.

Hourly employees at both factories will “continue to receive their normal pay through Monday, after which point we will provide paid leave during suspended operations,” according to an email from the company’s regional HR boss Valerie Workman viewed by The Verge. “Those who have been working from home should continue to do so and consider it business as usual. We understand you will have many questions and we will be providing you with additional resources in the coming hours and days,” Workman wrote.

Tesla says it will keep some “basic operations” up and running, like work on its charging infrastructure. The company’s Gigafactory in Nevada will continue as normal, despite a recent initiative from the state’s governor asking all nonessential businesses to close.

Tesla will do “touchless deliveries” moving forward

Tesla will keep making vehicle deliveries during the shutdown. The company says it is leveraging its app and its cars’ smartphone connectivity to implement “touchless deliveries” in “many locations” to help mitigate any spread of the virus. With the touchless deliveries, “customers are able to unlock their new cars at a delivery parking lot via the Tesla App, sign any remaining relevant paperwork that has been placed in their car, and return that paperwork to an on-site drop-off location prior to leaving,” the company says.

The leaders of six counties across the San Francisco Bay Area announced the shelter-in-place order on Monday, and as part of it, told all “nonessential businesses” to close down. But Tesla kept its car factory open, despite not seeming to fit the order’s definition of an “essential business.”

Late Tuesday evening, the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office announced that it believed Tesla was “not an essential business,” and said the company should scale back to the most basic operations, like payroll. Tesla’s factory remained open, though.

Workman told employees that it was because the company had been told it was considered “national critical infrastructure” by the Department of Homeland Security, though the government agency has not responded to multiple requests to confirm this. Guidance issued by its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Thursday did not list automotive manufacturing among a list of “critical infrastructure.”

On Thursday, the local police department tweeted that the police chief and members of the city’s management team was scheduled too meet with “Tesla Factory management” to “discuss cooperation for compliance with the County Health Officer’s Order.” Just a few hours later, Tesla announced the factory closure.

Tesla said Thursday that it believes the $6.3 billion in cash it had at the end of 2019, as well as the $2.3 billion it raised in February, will be “sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.”

Two employees at the California factory have told The Verge things already felt pretty uncertain this week as Tesla negotiated the immediate fate of the factory with local authorities. One shared screenshots of messages from coworkers who were worried they were feeling symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but felt they had no way to get tested.",real

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indefinitely extended its public health order on Tuesday, empowering border agents to quickly expel migrants who cross the border illegally. Why it matters: The order will be reviewed every 30 days. Border agents have already used the authority to expel more than 20,000 migrants, including asylum seekers and children, in less than 2 months, according to DHS data. The order will be in effect until CDC director Robert Redfield determines that the threat of coronavirus spreading from across southern or northern borders no longer poses a ""serious danger"" to public health.

Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra [BSO] and a popular draw for tourists in the Berkshire Mountains, has canceled its 2020 live performance season due to the coronavirus, the BSO announced on Friday.

Instead, the famed summer music festival is moving some of its offerings online, in the form of video and audio streams of archival performances and newly created material. Audiences will have to pay to stream some of that content, either single performances or in packages; other offerings will be free. Those streamed performances are scheduled to include cellist Yo-Yo Ma, pianist Daniil Trifonov and the Boston Symphony Chamber Players. Archival performances will include those by the BSO.

Along with its classical performances, Tanglewood is a pop music venue. The planned 2020 schedule included performances by James Taylor, Trey Anastasio, Brandi Carlile, Judy Collins and Arlo Guthrie, John Legend and Ringo Starr, as well as a taping of the NPR game show Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Several of those shows have already been rescheduled for the summer of 2021.

The Lenox, Mass., institution is also the home of two prestigious training programs for young classical musicians: the Tanglewood Music Center, for college-aged and emerging-professional instrumentalists and singers, and a program for high school-aged musicians affiliated with Boston University. Many of the world's most famed classical musicians have been part of those programs, either as teachers or students; for example, Leonard Bernstein was in residence at Tanglewood for 50 years.

Tanglewood also represents a substantial portion of the BSO's annual income — according to the symphony's most recent available financial report (from 2017-18), Tanglewood brought in more revenue than either the Boston Symphony's regular concert season or the Boston Pops.

The BSO has already been forced to take significant measures to curtail its financial losses due to the pandemic — which, as of mid-April, were some $6.2 million in revenue after the cancellation of about 130 events, including the entire Boston Pops season.

Last month, the orchestra announced it was furloughing 70 of its 300 full-time employees, and its musicians took pay cuts. Additionally, BSO president and CEO Mark Volpe took a 50% salary reduction, and its music director, Andris Nelsons, was not paid for canceled performances.

Tanglewood was founded in 1937; the only other times that the festival has been curtailed or canceled completely were during World War II.",real

Rebecca Shamtoob had only been working for a month at a firm based in a Manhattan WeWork before things started feeling off—well, more off than usual for the scandal-beset co-working company. It was early March, and COVID-19 cases were skyrocketing in New York City. She noticed the WeWork location was getting dirtier—particularly the bathrooms—and that there were few protective measures in place. WeWork staff were placing hand sanitizer at various places around the office, but people kept stealing the highly sought bottles, Shamtoob says. On March 12, the location threw a pizza and pie party for Pi Day (since March 14 was on a Saturday) and announced it would be the last office event for the foreseeable future. The location, at 401 Park Ave. S., planned to remain open for work, however. People were coughing and sharing food at the party, so Shamtoob decided to start working from home.

The email from WeWork came a week later: Someone at the location had tested positive for COVID-19. The last time that person had been in the office was the day of the Pi Day party.

You can understand why the co-working model would not be particularly appealing during a pandemic. But now that cases have exploded and lockdown orders across the country have prevented many people from even going in to work, many WeWork customers allege that the company has been inflexible in giving them breaks on rent and easing lease terms. WeWork is keeping its locations open, declaring itself an essential business. Yet many members feel that the offices are unusable, particularly given that nonessential workers are expected to stay home and the fact that there have been positive cases at some WeWork locations. The company has said that it is working with its 600,000 members on an individual basis to figure out compromises on rent during this time. But many members have been turning to media outlets to allege that WeWork has either offered unfair terms or completely refused to make concessions. (WeWork itself has stopped paying rent at certain locations.)

Many members have alleged that WeWork has either offered unfair terms or completely refused to make concessions.

When New York went into lockdown in late March, lawyer Stephanie Hendricks knew business for her practice would slow to a trickle. Hendricks contacted the WeWork branch at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where she’d been working since fall 2019, to see about getting a rent reduction. Instead, she says, the company shot down all her proposals, such as her suggestion that she simply pay WeWork a $600 monthly storage fee for her office supplies. (Her base rent is $1,850 per month.) Because her credit card was already on file, she had no way of stopping the payments. Getting out of the lease also isn’t an option, since she signed on for three years. At this point, she says there’s not much else she can do. “I’m honestly just taking things on a day-to-day basis,” she said. Hendricks said that when she’s gone in to check on her belongings, the workspace has been completely empty save for one staff member at the front desk. (The kitchen is no longer serving complimentary beverages.)

Jacob Feldman, CEO of the education consultancy Nexus Academics, had been on a month-to-month lease at the 300 Park Ave. WeWork location in Manhattan and was planning to move out when the pandemic hit. He told the company during the first week of March that he’d be leaving at the end of the month. WeWork told him, however, that he would’ve had to have notified them on Feb. 29 to do that—so he would have to pay through April 30.

Feldman says that getting in touch with WeWork representatives at the corporate level was impossible because by March, when New York’s coronavirus infections were rapidly climbing, they were overwhelmed with tons of other move-out requests. He asked his location’s office manager whether he could get a break on rent for April since the workspace had been closed for a combined two weeks for deep cleanings after several customers tested positive for the coronavirus. (When they did the cleanings, they would only close the floor where the infected person’s office was located, even though members are typically able to access all three floors.) The manager told him that he wouldn’t have to pay April rent, but only if he agreed to extend his lease through May. He opted to take the hit rather than extending.

Feldman recently visited the office during the workday to gather his belongings and noted that the lights were off and no other tenants were there. He saw two or three staff members who weren’t wearing masks. Some signs were up to remind people to practice social distancing, but that appeared to be the only protective measure that the location had taken.

Several members have now hired lawyers in an attempt to force WeWork to stop billing them and issue refunds for April and May. The firm Walden Macht & Haran is currently representing more than 20 small businesses located in New York, Los Angeles, and D.C. that initially found one another on social media and formed a group to protest WeWork’s practices. Lawyers on the case are also vetting 50 more from Ohio, Tennessee, and other states that have contacted the firm to join the group. The lawyers sent a letter to WeWork on Thursday threatening to pursue arbitration if its demands for rent relief and refunds are not met. It also asked the company to allow the customers to join together as a class in a potential suit; most WeWork contracts stipulate that tenants cannot join class-action lawsuits. WeWork replied to the firm’s letter asking for a list of the clients it’s representing, though the law firm wants a no-retaliation guarantee before providing it.

“For many of the clients we represent, WeWork’s monthly rent is the largest overhead they have, so forgiving rent during the pandemic while these stay-at-home orders are in place is a critical lifeline for these companies,” the law firm’s managing partner Jim Walden told Slate. “Our main goal is to convince WeWork that it should not be collecting rent from tenants in locations where people are not lawfully entitled to access the space.” Walden further noted that police have visited WeWork locations in Los Angeles and D.C. to ensure that people weren’t violating stay-at-home orders. He plans to file a letter with the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Justice alleging that WeWork is illegally ceasing retainers without a contractual basis and debiting accounts even when the company has received explicit requests not to do so. WeWork declined to comment on the legal dispute and customer complaints.

Even before the pandemic, WeWork had been trying to cut costs and shore up revenue streams wherever it could. In September, the company indefinitely postponed its initial public offering after investors brought up serious concerns about the company’s actual value and the leadership of now-former CEO Adam Neumann. From there, WeWork quickly unraveled, laying off thousands of workers in an attempt to stem its multibillion-dollar losses. Now, as the country faces an economic crisis and staying at home remains a necessity for the office workers upon whom WeWork relies, the company’s path to profitability seems even more remote. “I understand that WeWork is having its own difficulties. I’ve been rooting for them,” said Hendricks, the lawyer in Brooklyn. “I want to work with WeWork and not be treated like I have some magical ability to make money during this difficult economic time.”",real

3 possible futures for the pandemic

As the US starts to reopen, researchers have published estimates for the shape of the pandemic. They forecast that the pandemic will last 18 to 24 months, and they describe three scenarios:

1. ""Peaks and valleys."" In this scenario, the current wave — the second and highest wave on the chart below —will recede over the summer and then be followed by additional waves of similar magnitude for one to two years. The severity will vary by region and country. Different cities and countries may reimplement restrictions and mitigation measures.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

2. ""Fall peak."" The current wave would recede over the summer, as in the first scenario. But then we would be hit with a far more severe wave this fall. This is what happened in the 1918-19 ""Great Influenza"" pandemic, as well as less devastating flu pandemics in 1957-58 and 2009-10.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

3. ""Slow burn."" The most encouraging scenario. The current wave is by far the worst. And then the pandemic smolders for an additional few years while life goes on.

Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm

Note that none of these scenarios involves the coronavirus just disappearing after this first big wave recedes.

The researchers do not address the possibility that scientists will develop a powerful drug in the next few months that can ""cure"" the disease or a vaccine that will prevent it. They note that vaccines have not played a role in prior flu pandemics.

Sharon Begley of STAT News describes each of these scenarios in detail here. —HB

Meanwhile, a government document projects that the US ""daily case"" and ""daily death"" rates will skyrocket later this month

The New York Times got its hands on a document described as a ""situation update"" from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The document appears to have been updated through May 1. It includes projections for a radical increase in expected ""new cases per day"" and ""deaths per day"" in the second half of this month.

US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times

Department of Homeland Security, via New York Times

To emphasize: The top chart calls for the skyrocketing of daily new cases to more than 200,000 by the end of May, up from about 30,000 now.

The presentation does not explain why the model predicts this acceleration.

An hour after the document was published, the White House disavowed it. A White House representative told Insider's Eliza Relman that it ""is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting"" and that ""this data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.""

So now we need to understand where those projections came from and whether any government experts believe they are realistic.

Here are the historical numbers in the presentation, which have plateaued at about 30,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per day:

Yes, the coronavirus is roughest on old and sick people, but it's awful for some younger people too

Insider's Aria Bendix, a healthy reporter in her 20s, developed nasty COVID-19 symptoms in late March, which she described here. Nearly 50 days later, she's still not back to full strength.

Aria's not alone. Here, she interviews four other otherwise healthy people in their 20s and 30s who have been sick for more than a month.

Meanwhile, Insider's Lydia Ramsey describes how doctors in New York City continue to be surprised and alarmed by the number of younger people who are getting COVID-19, as well as how serious it is for some of them.

In New York, 18- to 44-year-olds make up about 10% of total cases. More than 4,300 of them have been hospitalized. Nearly 300 of them have died. —HB

Will summer help?

There is still hope that warmer temperatures will halt or at least slow the spread of the virus.

The researchers in the study and the article referenced above conclude that summer will reduce the transmissibility of the virus by about 20% — enough to slow it down, but not enough to eliminate it. —HB

Dictators should be great during a pandemic. Why are they botching it?

Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to Denis Protsenko, chief physician of a hospital for COVID-19 patients on the outskirts of Moscow on March 24. Sputnik/Alexey Druzhinin/Kremlin/Reuters

Russia's COVID-19 outbreak is blazing, with record cases reported on Sunday. Wouldn't you think Vladimir Putin would be handling it better?

Authoritarians love nothing more than ordering the government to do whatever they want, imposing tight controls on the population, and wantonly enacting emergency restrictions, so you'd expect Putin and his fellow authoritarians to shine during the pandemic. But it's not working out that way.

Across the world, dictators, as well as democratically elected leaders with authoritarian tendencies, are doing poorly. Putin seems bored by the crisis. Iran continues to be a wreck. The dictator of Belarus, denying that the coronavirus is a threat, has ordered life to continue as usual, leading to one of the world's fastest-rising infection rates. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's he-man approach— combining skepticism of science with macho recklessness — has made a mess of Brazil's response.

This isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Plenty of vibrant democracies — Spain, Italy — have struggled with outbreaks, and China almost certainly extinguished its outbreak more rapidly thanks to its totalitarian tools. But in general, controlling the virus seems easier when there's public trust in government, reliable and transparent data, and visible popular support for action — all of which are hard for authoritarians to muster. Also authoritarians tend to prefer problems they can solve quickly with force or rhetoric, neither of which works on the coronavirus.

Oh, and it doesn't help to build trust in public health when any health professional who casts doubt on the government's response falls out a window the next day, as seems to happen in Russia. —DP

Vote-by-mail data that could worry Republicans

The savage battle over voting by mail in the 2020 election could be shaped by some unexpected news out of Wisconsin. Last month, as Wisconsin held in-person voting during the pandemic, the US Supreme Court refused to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots. The ruling was seen as a big win for Republicans.

Less noticed was that the court did allow Wisconsin to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day. Under previous rules, Wisconsin accepted only ballots that arrived by Election Day. The Washington Post found that in Wisconsin's two biggest cities, 10% of all ballots were postmarked before Election Day and arrived after Election Day. In other words, 10% of voters in those cities wouldn't have even been counted in previous years.

The Wisconsin vote could be anomalous: Wisconsin officials and voters had only a few days to prepare and no precedent for pandemic voting. The rest of the country will have months to set rules for pandemic-afflicted balloting.

Still the Wisconsin mail-in data may alarm Republicans, who generally benefit from fewer people voting. Expect them to seek to limit the SCOTUS ruling and to persuade state legislatures to find other ways to restrict voting by mail. Seven states, all Republican-controlled, have already limited balloting by mail to elderly voters. —DP

What will restaurants and offices look like post-pandemic?

Check out this Insider photo essay about restaurants in China after COVID-19: taped-off seats, hand sanitizer on tap, temperature checks at the door. (Meanwhile, in a sign of how hard the virus is to control, the city of Harbin has just closed ""dine-in"" restaurants after an outbreak.)

And The New York Times speculates how the pandemic will transform open-plan offices into places with sneeze guards, push-down air vents, and way more space between coworkers. It's going to be a good time to be an interior designer. —DP

Biden should release his Senate archives only if Trump releases his tax returns

As Insider's Nicole Einbinder reported last week, Joe Biden has 1,875 boxes full of records at the University of Delaware from his time in the Senate that are unavailable to the public. One or two of these boxes, the theory goes, might contain references to Tara Reade, the former staffer who recently accused Biden of sexually assaulting her.

Biden denied the allegations in an interview on Friday and said that the Delaware boxes didn't contain any materials related to Reade.

Reade has said that the boxes aren't likely to contain any references to a sexual assault because she didn't tell Biden's team about it.

Naturally, people are still calling on Biden to unseal all those boxes. If he doesn't, the existence of the boxes threatens to become the same sort of ""what's he hiding?"" weapon that was used so effectively against Hillary Clinton in 2016. (""But her emails…"")

The desire to search all potential evidence to get to the bottom of the story is understandable. But the request that Biden unseal his boxes when President Donald Trump still has yet to release his tax returns seems an absurd double standard. —HB

Warren Buffett gives up on airlines

The Oracle of Omaha announced that he had dumped all his airline holdings. He thinks it's unlikely that as many people will fly in the next two to three years as they did last year. And he believes that even if capacity returns to 70% to 80% of what it once was, the airlines will still have too many planes.

History supports this view.

The last big gut punch to the industry came after 9/11. The fallout from that event was shorter and less devastating than the current one. But still … the economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research points that it took about seven years for travel spending on airlines to recover. —HB

The Big 3*!

YouTubers pretending to be Jimmy Fallon tricked the ""Tiger King"" star Carole Baskin into doing an interview.

Insider's Lindsay Dodgson has the inside story of who the tricksters are, how they did it, and what they learned about the famous reality-TV star who some think killed her husband and fed him to her big cats.

Former NBA star Charles Barkley has bad news for LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, and others who are occasionally thought to be the best of all time: Michael Jordan was better.

Few people who watched Jordan's dominance in the 1990s would disagree.

Trump's latest scapegoat for his bungled coronavirus response is Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The president told Fox News that Fauci told him the virus was no big deal.

I do not believe this is hyperbolic for the following reasons: massive unemployment, a restless, heavily armed citizenry and a government refusing or incapable of providing solutions.

A few weeks ago, we saw a preview of what could come when discontented citizens roamed the halls of the Michigan Capitol armed with assault rifles. Although the misspelled protest signs became the butt of late-night comics, the real signs were ominous. Most likely the men with assault rifles never had the courage to serve in the military, but they can still spew 45 deadly rounds in a minute. That was not free speech — it was intended to intimidate and threaten.

Throughout history (think Weimar Republic) political threats are a pre-cursor to real violence. It is true that only a fringe of society roams around with Confederate flags, and assault rifles, but it is also true that most of the rest us are profoundly anxious about the future. If history has taught us anything, it is that we need a massive government program to address those fears.

We need a COVID Marshall Plan.

Protestors brandishing guns gather at the state Capitol steps to oppose Gov. Whitmer's stay home orders in response to the spread of coronavirus in Michigan (Photo: Andy Morrison)

As the number of unemployed exceed Great Depression levels, we should be reminded of what distinguished us from what happened in Germany and Italy: Roosevelt’s New Deal. What saved Europe from degenerating into chaos and despotism after WWII was the Marshall Plan. We need a massive jobs program with guaranteed income for working families to survive.

Employing people to track people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 will require over a million people. Industries can be retooled to produce PPE and therapeutics. Infrastructure projects could easily be accomplished with adequate protection for workers.

For service workers who cannot return to work in the foreseeable future, a guaranteed income would provide support until work becomes available. If we can give trillions to save corporations, we can spare a couple thousand per month for citizens to make us safe and to rebuild the country.

What we lack is any political leadership to design such a plan.

We are already in social turmoil. The militia types obviously have no fear of parading their threats in public. The economy will not recover soon. A predictable second wave of infection (with much more severe consequences) will cause citizens to drift toward the political extremes.

Instead of leaving Americans to sit at home watching endless news of doom while facing disastrous debt, why not put our country to work and really focus on a better future?

How can this be?

Because we have just eliminated tens of millions of low-wage/low hour jobs and the mix of jobs has reversed in favor of better paying positions — for all the wrong reasons.

The debate over why wages were growing so poorly since the great recession is now over – the answer is that the US was adding mostly low-wage/low-quality jobs.

Dan Alpert is an adjunct professor at Cornell Law School and a founding managing partner of the New York investment bank Westwood Capital LLC.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

This Friday, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will be releasing its Employment Situation Report — more commonly known as the jobs report — for the month of April 2020.

The jobs report will allow us all to see the broader impact of the unprecedented employment depression resulting from the coronavirus crisis. The size of the job loss is certain to be devastating, but some numbers may not look so bad.: Average hourly wages, hours worked and average weekly incomes will likely jump more on a month-over-month basis than ever before in the history of the data.

Moreover, when the May jobs report is released on June 5, we will likely see March through May large increases in each of these measures for the production and nonsupervisory workers who are still employed. Average hourly earnings could increase 4% to 6% over this time period; hours worked could increase 6% to 8% ; and weekly incomes could jump as much as 10% to 15% .

This will not be because workers remaining on the job have gotten raises, are working longer hours, or are taking home more money overall. It will be due to the near elimination of tens of millions of low-wage, low-hour jobs over the course of the US global economic lockdown.

We saw a smattering of this phenomenon last month with the release of the BLS report for March. Average hourly wages for production and nonsupervisory workers jumped by 10 cents, or 0.42% in one month from February to March. In the same period, the US lost 713,000 private sector jobs. This was just the tip of the iceberg, as initial jobless claims showed layoffs and furloughs through April 25 totaled 30.3 million since the crisis began.

We are experiencing the fastest moving and largest loss of jobs in the history of employment data record keeping. The monthly BLS Employment Situation Report uses data collected each month for the payroll period in which the twelfth of the month occurs. Therefore, the March report was for the payroll week ended March 13, and the report that will be issued this coming Friday will contain data collected for the week ended April 17.

So by construction, the numbers released on jobs day will continue to lag the rapidly changing facts on the ground. We are unlikely to get a full picture of the depth and breadth of the crisis until June.

By mid-May, it is likely that we will see continuing unemployment claims begin to peak, as the nation slowly reopens the economy (which data we will not see from the Department of Labor until May 28). And, as I wrote (way back, it seems) on March 14, the mounting layoffs and furloughs have unsurprisingly disproportionately hit front-line, customer-facing production and non-supervisory jobs – most of which are low-wage, low hour positions.

Assuming that continuing claims (which were just under 18 million for the week ending April 18, the latest data available) peak at between 30 and 35 million – which seems likely – at some point we will know the actual mix of job losses as between low-paying and higher paying jobs.

But what is clear today is that the US economy has been massively dependent on increasing numbers of low quality jobs to employ its workers. And the current crisis is about to prove conclusively what the Job Quality Index (JQI), developed by my colleagues and myself in 2019, has shown about the anemic average wage growth of recent years. More specifically, that increases in overall employment were substantially offset by a surge in low-wage, low-hour jobs as a percentage of the mix.

And now we will see what happens when you wipe out over 20 million of those low quality jobs: average wages and weekly incomes will jump in an economy otherwise devastated beyond all belief.

To estimate the impact on averages wages, hours worked and weekly incomes of production and non-supervisory jobs (until recently, 83% of the jobs out there) I opened up the JQI model and attributed loss factors, at peak, to the most severely impacted job categories chosen carefully to exclude things like grocery store and pharmacy jobs, which we know are still seeking workers.

It would be fair to argue that there are other sectors impacted by layoffs and furloughs – there most certainly are. And one can certainly debate the level of peak losses I estimated in the chart presented here. This is just one cut at very complex data.

The upshot is that the forgoing methodology forecasts peak losses of some 27.6 million of production and non-supervisory jobs. This would be more or less consistent with overall continuing unemployment claims of about 33 million to 35 million at peak (some of which will be managerial and supervisory jobs and some self-employed workers newly qualifying for unemployment insurance under emergency programs).

The high end of the likely ranges for changes to average hourly wages, hours worked and weekly incomes, presented in the opening paragraphs of this piece, are indicative of the foregoing modeling. The lower end of the ranges is indicative of what would be the case if job losses permeated deeper into the goods producing and professional services sectors than is reflected in the data.

So here we have the cruelest of laboratory experiments to prove the point about deteriorating job quality in America. We will see what happens when many of the sub-par jobs on which the country's employment picture has become so dependent, disappear overnight.

And we will see in the data, to some extent, how the ""other half"" has been living — which is to say, much better.

What can we do?,"It is incredible, to say the least, everything that is happening worldwide. Undoubtedly it is hard to believe that this is even real. Sometimes I think we are in a bad dream hoping to wake up soon. As a mother, the first thing that comes to mind is my family’s safety. Understanding and implementing every precaution possible to protect my children is my top priority. Of course, due to my personal journey and now as a wellness blogger and health advocate I can’t help to wonder how much of impact this COVID-19 disease may have on cancer patients.

We already know that cancer patients are immune-compromised, to begin with. Therefore, cancer patients automatically fall in the higher risk category. But what about those that are in the treatment and those that are in remission? According to a small study conducted in Wuhan, China, “Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection,” the study, which was recently published in the Annals of Oncology, states. “It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.”

Furthermore, researchers found “more than half (53.6%) of the patients involved in the study developed severe events—defined by admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or death—with 28.6% of the patients dying. This is far higher than the general COVID-19-infected population, which has an average clinically critical status rate of 4.7%, and a mortality rate of 2.3%.”

Researchers also wrote, “Patients with lung cancer, with worse baseline lung function and endurance, are more likely to develop more severe anoxia and progress more rapidly with COVID-19”

I’m not a researcher but my common sense tells me that the conclusion found on this small study conducted ironically enough in Wuhan China makes a lot of sense. Of course, the outcome for cancer patients would be poor and more challenging if dealing with the COVID-19 in addition to cancer. This is why it is vital for patients to be proactive in their current treatment plan and implement a preventive plan not only to get tested but discuss with their medical/ oncology team the possibilities before continuing with immunosuppressing treatments, making themselves more vulnerable to COVID-19.

What Can We Do?

In one of my most recent blog articles titled “How to fight the Coronavirus naturally” I share additional helpful tips to help you boost your immunity and take additional precautions as a preventive mechanism for you to be safe during this crisis. Let me provide you with a quick summary:

Practice the following to prevent and protect from the virus:

• Social distancing (2 meters minimum) because the secretions that are the ones that contaminate cannot move more than 2 meters due to the weight of the virus.

• Correct handwashing, for 20 seconds (both surfaces, anterior-posterior, interfaces, and fingertips) each time you come from outside or enter or leave any public space.

• Use of masks when traveling through crowded areas (supermarkets, banks, hospitals, etc.)

• Clean surfaces with disinfectant (especially those that may be in common and frequent contact)

Boost your Immune System

Keeping our immunity strong is most definitely the best form of prevention and our strongest defense when facing any sort of illness that threatens our lives. Here are some powerful and amazing tips to help you boost your immunity:

Take a good Probiotic

Take Vitamin D3

Vitamin C IV therapy

Take Camu Camu Powder

Take Beta Glucan

Eat Adaptogens like Maca

Follow a Plant-based Diet

Mild Exercise

Rebound

Infrared Sauna

Chiropractic Care

Colloidal Silver

Water

If you like to learn more about each one of those recommendations read my article on “How to fight the Coronavirus Naturally.” I hope you find this blog article helpful and as always I welcome your comments and I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me.

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s cricket board (BCCI) will wait for more clarity on international travel restrictions before making a call on the limited-overs tour of Sri Lanka in July, a top board official told Reuters.

Virat Kohli’s team are scheduled to play three one-dayers and the same number of Twenty20 Internationals in Sri Lanka but the series is under threat due to measures imposed to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Nothing has been decided as yet, because we are not sure what would be the travel restrictions then,” BCCI treasurer Arun Singh Dhumal told Reuters by telephone.

“There is no clarity about it. So we’ll wait for that and accordingly take a call.”

India has extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 while all commercial flights in and out of Sri Lanka remain suspended at least until the end of the month.

Bangladesh are being similarly cautious for their three-test series in Sri Lanka in July and August.

“We have to look at travelling restrictions in Bangladesh, and the quarantine protocols in both countries,” Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told ESPNcricinfo.

“We have to be mindful of the players’ readiness ... we have to figure out other details about this tour.”

Sri Lanka have already had to postpone home series against England and South Africa because of the global health crisis.",real

LONDON (Reuters) - There are tentative signs that children may not spread the novel coronavirus as much as adults, two top epidemiologists said on Tuesday, though they cautioned that the bad news was that human immunity may not last that long.

As Europe and the United States try to get back to work after the first deadly wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, world leaders are trying to work out when it is safe for children and students can get back to their studies.

The signs are that children may not spread it as much as adults, Dr Rosalind Eggo, who is on committees that advise the British government on its infectious disease response, told members of parliament’s upper house.

“We think that children are less likely to get it so far but it is not certain, we are very certain that children are less likely to have severe outcomes and there are hints that children are less infectious but it is not certain,” said Eggo of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

John Edmunds, a member of Britain’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), told the House of Lords’ science committee that it was striking how children did not seem to play much of a role in spreading the novel coronavirus.

“It is unusual that children don’t seem to play much of a role in transmission because for most respiratory viruses and bacteria they play a central role, but in this they don’t seem to,” said Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

“There is only one documented outbreak associated with a school - which is amazing,” Edmunds said.

But he added there was potentially bad news, though, that human immunity to the novel coronavirus may not last long.",real

Updated at 6:58 a.m. ET Saturday

Congress has authorized roughly $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months. These bills attempt to protect the American economy from long-term harm caused by stay-at-home orders and respond to the overall impact of the virus.

On Friday, the House approved a Democrats-only bill to spend another $3 trillion. Republicans have rejected the proposal, known as the HEROES Act, and are calling for a pause on new aid. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the latest legislation is her starting point for any new negotiations.

In several cases, Congress voted on the relief spending with little time to review the proposals and without an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But now CBO has released estimates showing that the costs of some programs are expected to outpace early projections — driving up the total cost of the bills.

These long-term expenses will be added on top of recent projections from the CBO that the U.S. deficit would be more than $3.7 trillion in 2020.

The NPR Politics Podcast House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill Listen · 14:56 14:56

NPR reviewed data and estimates reported by the CBO to break down how Congress allocated money to respond to the pandemic. Those estimates, known as scores, detail how much the agency expects programs will cost and how those measures will impact the debt, deficit and government revenue.

In some cases, Congress approved a fixed amount of money for a program, like the Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.

In other cases, like the expanded unemployment insurance and tax credits for emergency paid family and sick leave, Congress approved the credits and their values but did not put a cap on the expenditures. When that happens, the CBO estimates the number of people and companies that may take advantage of the program. The CBO often provides those estimates in two-year figures, in part because it may take time for businesses and individuals to file claims.

Here's how the coronavirus relief money breaks down.

Loading...

The bulk of the support for individuals was approved in the second and third packages, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act, also known as CARES.

The biggest expenditures on individuals have been on cash relief payments, expansions to unemployment assistance, emergency family and medical leave.

Cash relief payments: $293 billion (estimated)

Many people have already started to receive direct deposits totaling as much as $1,200 under the program known as recovery rebates. Individuals earning less than $75,000 can expect a one-time cash payment of $1,200. Married couples would each receive a check and families would get $500 per child. That means a family of four earning less than $150,000 can expect $3,400.

The checks start to phase down after that and disappear completely for people making more than $99,000 and couples making more than $198,000.

The cash payments are based on most recent tax filings. People who receive Social Security payments, people experiencing homelessness and others who don't typically need to file tax return are still eligible, too.

Expanded unemployment insurance: $268 billion (estimated).

The third piece of legislation included temporary changes to federal unemployment benefits, including a supplemental benefit for all workers and new protections for gig workers.

Under the legislation, states will still pay base unemployment to people who qualify. That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it. Congress added $600 per week from the federal government on top of whatever base amount a worker receives from the state. That boosted payment will last through the end of July.

For example, if an out-of-work person is receiving the national average of about $340 per week, under the new federal program their take-home pay will be $940.

The legislation also adds 13 weeks of unemployment insurance. People nearing the maximum number of weeks allowed by their state would get an extension. New filers would also be allowed to collect the benefits for the longer period.

The estimated cost also includes a new, temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of this year to help people who lose work as a direct result of the public health emergency.

The Congressional Budget Office made their predictions based on a model projecting an unemployment rate reaching 14% in the second quarter of this year and remaining at 10% at the end of 2021.

Administration officials have admitted in recent weeks that the rate could continue rise in the immediate term before recovering. The scorekeepers specifically noted that this is just a projection and the numbers could change, which would in turn change the overall cost of the changes to unemployment insurance.

Emergency family and medical leave: $105 billion (estimated).

The second bill congress approved included new tax credits for businesses to support emergency family and medical leave.

Under the bill, certain employers are required to give up to 80 hours of fully paid sick leave if the employee is unable to work because they are in quarantine and/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical care. Those employers would also have to approve up to 80 hours of partially paid leave for people caring for someone under the same conditions or to care for a child under 18 whose regular child care facility or school is closed.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that offering employers fully refundable credits against payroll taxes to compensate employees for the leave will cost the government about $105 billion. This cost is unlike a program where the federal government pays for the benefit directly. Instead, the cost is based on the expectation that the Treasury Department will lose revenues as a result of the policies.

Cost reductions for individuals on federal health insurance programs: $8.6 billion (estimated two-year cost)

The second coronavirus relief bill eliminates any cost-sharing for people seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This was intended to make it easier for low-income people to get tested.

Loading...

The total amount available to big businesses is well over $500 billion. The CARES Act includes a section described as Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy. That is the long way of describing aid for big businesses. This includes emergency lending from the federal reserve, credit assistance to airlines and pandemic relief for airline workers.

Extra lending authority for the Federal Reserve: $454 billion (this money is expected to be fully recouped with fees and repayments)

This portion of the bill has a big price tag up front, but the CBO estimates that the repayment, fees and other economic activity will make up for the initial spending. They do not consider it a true cost to the federal budget or the deficit. The chart includes the money because it is an approved expenditure, but it is considered in a separate category than the remaining spending. The Federal Reserve has also taken separate actions that don't involve Congress.

Airlines: $58 billion

This money is allocated to help airlines stay open. One portion of that money is set aside to help cover employee wages, salaries and benefits divided up as up to $25 billion for passenger air carriers, up to $4 billion for cargo air carriers, and up to $3 billion for airline contractors.

Loading...

There is more than $800 billion in small business aid spread across the four bills that have passed so far. The biggest portion of that sum is dedicated to the forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The first round of PPP — $349 billion — ran out in less than two weeks. Congress approved another $321 billion that is still being spent.

Small businesses also have access to $21 billion in disaster grants plus some additional loan subsidies. There's also a tax credit for keeping employees on payroll that is estimated to cost about $52 billion.

Loading...

Some elements of the CARES act support a wide range of businesses without the size limitations included in the PPP. The legislation establishes a fully refundable tax credit for businesses of all sizes that are closed or distressed to help them keep workers on the payroll. The credit is expected to cost about $52 billion.

The goal is to help businesses re-hire employees that have already been laid off or furloughed. The credit covers to 50% of payroll on the first $10,000 of compensation, including health benefits, for each employee.

For employers with more than 100 full-time employees, the credit is for wages paid to employees when they are not providing services because of the coronavirus. Eligible employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees could use the deduction even if they aren't closed.

Other broader business supports include a delay in when payroll taxes are due, which the CBO estimates will cost $352 billion up front but will be largely repaid years in the future. There are also tax changes increasing the cap on net operating losses and changing the rules for interest deductibility.

Loading...

All four bills include money to help support hospitals and public health systems. The most expensive items include funding for research and development, direct aid to hospitals and care centers, and money to offset more of the cost of treating Medicare patients.

The first bill focused primarily on public health and global health. It was passed in the weeks before it was clear how deeply the coronavirus would affect the U.S. It included $3.1 billion for vaccine and treatment research, $3.2 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.2 billion for the State Department to carry out global health programs.

The CARES Act provided $1.32 billion for community health centers that provide health care for roughly 28 million people.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got another $4.3 billion from CARES and the Strategic National Stockpile received $16 billion.

Loading...

Congress has set aside roughly $28 billion to help pay for testing and access to testing. Other spending areas, including funding for the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health have been used to boost testing capacity and speed up the process of approvals.

Loading...

States and local governments have access to funds in a number of programs, particularly public health funding and money for publicly run hospitals and community health centers.

The Families First Coronavirus Response bill included $1 billion for state and local administrative costs, and CARES included $150 billion in direct aid to states for the coronavirus response.

Loading...

There is long list of miscellaneous programs including those that shore up social safety net programs but do not pay money directly to individuals. In many cases, the funding helps support existing federal programs that have been stretched during the coronavirus response.

Child nutrition: There is $8.8 billion in the CARES Act to give schools more flexibility to provide meals for students.

Food stamps: CARES also included $15.5 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. The money will help cover the expected cost of new applications to the program as a result of the coronavirus. That bill also included $450 million more for food banks and other community food distribution programs.

Government administration: CARES included $10 billion in lending for the Postal Service, the Families First Coronavirus bill gave the IRS $15 million to implement programs – the filing date was extended to July 15.",real

What?,"As several members of the White House staff self-isolate themselves amid possible contacts with a person who tested positive for COVID-19, US President Donald Trump claims that he is tested daily and is taking precautionary measures to protect himself from the disease - while some netizens are asking for protection from the way he updates.

US President Donald Trump - in an extraordinary manner - announced on Thursday that he does not have the coronavirus after having been tested that morning. He delivered the news in a dramatic way that left netizens pondering whether they actually understood his message. According to Trump, he ""tested very positively in another sense"". To be more precise, he ""tested positively toward negative"".

Trump described his test results as ""perfect"". In the end, the President finally clarified that he had again tested negative for the coronavirus.

Here is a quote from Trump:



""I tested very positively in another sense so— this morning. Yeah. I tested positively toward negative, right. So. I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning I tested negative."" pic.twitter.com/xA0DBUcfr9 — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 21, 2020

​The flowery quote immediately caused waves on Twitter, as users went on to try and decipher the message.

I’m positively in pain from listening to that. — Hamish Mitchell (@H_MitchellPhoto) May 21, 2020

Why is it so difficult for him to say “I tested negative for the virus again just this morning?” — JAM (@Eviljohna) May 21, 2020

I’m positive that a Trump brain MRI would read negative. Wait, I mean positive? No, negative. Wait...positive? — Dr. Zoidberg (@psuvafan007) May 21, 2020

The netizens remembered pretty much every praise Trump gave himself for his eloquence.

when you said what you said that I did not really hear I heard what you said but it was not what i said when you said it was really not said but I said yes it was what I thought but not what I meant when you said it you said it being you said what I heard was not what you said — Essence of Lursa Stands with Joe Biden 🐾☂️🦎🌊 (@KapeciaResists) May 21, 2020

​Twitterati also noted that Trump tends to be ""sarcastic"" often, noting that calling everything a joke may eventually stop working, especially in the light of the upcoming presidential election.

@GOP This WILL be a part of many Democratic campaigns. And if anybody dares to say he was ""just joking"" or being ""sarcastic"", he's already used up all those playing cards. — guitr25 (@guitr25) May 21, 2020

​And some even got creative and went on to make a parody.

​Earlier in the week, Trump claimed that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against COVID-19, receiving criticizm and concern from medical professionals for supporting the use of an anti-malaria drug that has not been clinically confirmed to be effective against the coronavirus. Following the claim that was taking the drug, Trump then announced that he would end his purported hydroxychloroquine regimen before the end of the week.",fake

This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump calls to “LIBERATE” states where people are protesting social distancing restrictions.President Trump on Friday openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables.
In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his announcement on Thursday night suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base.
Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.
Mr. Trump’s call for liberation from social distancing rules followed protests around the country as protesters — many wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats — congregated in packed groups around state capitols to demand that restrictions be immediately lifted and to demonize their Democratic governors.
In Michigan, protesters waved banners in support of Mr. Trump and protested Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by chanting, “Lock her up.” In St. Paul, Minn., a group calling itself “Liberate Minnesota” rallied against stay-at-home orders in front of the home of Gov. Tim Walz. In Columbus, Ohio, protesters crowded closely together as they pressed up against the doors of the state’s Capitol.
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said Mr. Trump’s tweets “encourage illegal and dangerous acts” and said the president was “putting millions of people in danger of contracting Covid-19.”
Mr. Inslee added: “His unhinged rantings and calls for people to ‘liberate’ states could also lead to violence. We’ve seen it before.”
And in Michigan, Ms. Whitmer said she hoped the president’s comments would not incite more protests.
“The most important thing that anyone with a platform can do is try to use that platform to tell people, ‘We are going to get through this,’” she said.
The lack of testing presents a serious challenge to reopening, health experts say.
Any effort by states to begin to ease restrictions requires an expanded testing capacity to give people a sense of security, health experts say, and the country is far behind in conducting enough tests to responsibly inform those decisions.
But Vice President Mike Pence asserted on Friday that the United States currently has the testing capacity to allow all states to move to begin the first phase of the White House’s guidelines for reopening their economies.
“Our best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of phase one reopening if state governors should choose to do that,” Mr. Pence said at the White House’s daily briefing. He was followed by several top public health officials, who provided a detailed description of the nation’s testing capacity, whose scale they said was underappreciated.
Speaking after Mr. Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, said that “existing capacity” for testing nationwide can be utilized, but used the future tense when discussing the potential for states to scale back social distancing measures. “We will have, and there will be enough tests to take this country safely through phase one,” Dr. Fauci said.
The numbers the officials cited in the briefing — 3.7 million tests so far, and about 120,000 tests per day — represent the current snapshot of testing in the United States. But experts said that testing will have to be drastically expanded to get an accurate picture of how the virus is spreading around the country, and to be able to stamp out future outbreaks. The ultimate goal is to separate the sick from the healthy so that Americans feel safe returning to a somewhat normal life and the virus does not sweep through communities again, which requires more widespread testing.
The capacity for such testing has been growing but not fast enough, public health experts say. Supplies continue to run out and some areas are still only testing people who present specific symptoms. Tests to determine whether someone has already had the virus are slowly rolling out, but most have not been vetted by the Food and Drug Administration.
State health officials and medical providers nationwide say they still cannot diagnose as many people as they need. The biggest challenge is gettingthe supplies needed to process tests, including chemical reagents, swabs and pipettes. Manufacturers of those supplies are facing a huge global demand.
Without widespread testing and surveillance, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York, “we won’t be able to quickly identify and isolate cases in which the patients are presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and thus community transmission could be re-established.”
Mr. Trump, whose administration has been criticized for its slow rollout of tests as the virus took hold in the United States, again sought to portray testing as a state responsibility on Friday, even as many governors are pleading for more federal help.
At his briefing at the White House on Friday evening, Mr. Trump dismissed the concerns that public health experts have raised about testing, claiming that “the United States has the most robust, advanced and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.” He rejected criticisms of its shortcomings as “false and misleading” and reiterated his position that “the governors are responsible for testing.”
Earlier Friday, a telephone call between Mr. Pence and Senate Democrats grew heated as Democrats pressed the vice president about the lack of testing. Senator Angus King, the independent senator from Maine, called the lack of national testing a “dereliction of duty.”
In recent weeks, the F.D.A. has approved new tests that could make doing testing easier, such as one that measures the level of virus in saliva and does not need a swab. The F.D.A. also recently said a new kind of swab could be used to test for the virus, a polyester type that can be quickly manufactured in the millions. Both the saliva test and the polyester swab were cited by officials during the briefing.
Cuomo and Trump spar over the federal response to the outbreak.
In another series of tweets on Friday, the president rekindled a fight with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, only days after heaping praise on him, by saying that the state’s chief executive should “spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining.’”
The retort came after Mr. Cuomo said that New York could not fully reopen its economy without more widespread testing and help from the federal government. Even before Mr. Cuomo had finished speaking during his televised daily briefing, Mr. Trump lashed out, tweeting, “We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with testing that you should be doing.” He said Mr. Cuomo owed the federal government a thank-you.
“First of all, if he’s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right?” Mr. Cuomo responded in real time. “Second, let’s keep emotion and politics out of this, and personal ego if we can. Because this is about the people.”
Mr. Cuomo said another 630 people died of the virus in New York on Thursday, according to official state figures, bringing the total confirmed death toll to 12,822. He said the toll was “breathtaking in its pain and grief and tragedy.”
Prominent conservatives and donors are behind some statehouse protests.
The protests in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere calling for easing the restrictions were reminiscent of the early days of the Tea Party movement, when angry activists stormed town hall meetings of Democratic members of Congress to protest President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. Both featured impassioned demonstrators on the ground — and the behind-the-scenes involvement of prominent conservatives and donors.
The chairman of one of the groups behind Michigan’s protest on Thursday, the Michigan Freedom Fund, is Greg McNeilly, a close longtime associate of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. McNeilly has denied any involvement by Ms. DeVos or others in her family, which has long financed conservative causes in Michigan.
Others organizing protests have been open about the involvement of outside donors.Speaking on a YouTube program called “Freedom on Tap,” the Trump-allied economics commentator Stephen Moore said he was “working with a group in Wisconsin that wants to do a drive-in,” which he equated to the sit-ins of the civil rights era, only this time in protest of the restrictions put in place by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat.
Speaking of the planned Wisconsin rally, he said he had one big donor who had promised to pay the bail and legal fees of anyone who was arrested.
“So this is a great time, gentlemen and ladies, for civil disobedience,” Mr. Moore said. “We need to be the Rosa Parks here, and protest against these government injustices.”
Mr. Moore serves on Mr. Trump’s coronavirus economic advisory group and has helped start another group urging a faster reopening of the economy, called Save Our Country.
Mr. Trump had briefly considered Mr. Moore last year for a seat on the Federal Reserve board, but Mr. Moore’s past comments about women, including that they should not earn more than men, drew criticism.
In an interview, Mr. Moore declined to name the donor he was referring to, but described him as “so upset about what’s happening with the abridgment of freedom.”
Likening the latest protests to the Tea Party, he said that to focus on donors is to miss true wellsprings of anger among everyday people. “These are people coming to us, but we’re not coming to them,” he said. “All we’re trying to do is just encourage people to participate.”
The federal government will direct $19 billion in aid to farmers.President Trump said on Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by the fallout from the coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.
Most of the aid — $16 billion — will be in the form of direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from the outbreak, Mr. Trump said in a briefing. The government will also buy $3 billion worth of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed to people in need through food banks and other community and faith organizations, he added.
“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said of farmers. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening, and they never complained.”
The Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers over the past year to help offset the pain of the president’s trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets.
The spread of the coronavirus has further disrupted agricultural supply chains. Outbreaks have shuttered meat processing plants, while the closure of restaurants and food service, a major consumer of American food products, means some dairy farmers have been forced to dump their milk.
“Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking as well to those who produce them,” Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, said in the briefing.
At least 7,000 people living in or connected to U.S. nursing homes have died.
The first warning of the devastation that the coronavirus could wreak inside American nursing homes came in late February, when residents of a facility in suburban Seattle perished, one by one, as families waited helplessly outside.
In the ensuing six weeks, large and shockingly lethal outbreaks have continued to ravage nursing homes across the nation. Now a tally by The New York Times has found the number of people living in or connected to nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7,000, far higher than previously known.
In New Jersey, 17 bodies piled up in a nursing home morgue, and more than a quarter of a Virginia home’s residents have died. At least 24 people at a facility in Maryland have died; more than 100 residents and workers have been infected at another in Kansas; and people have died in centers for military veterans in Florida, Nevada, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
Over all, about a fifth of deaths from the virus in the United States have been tied to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, The Times review of cases shows. And more than 36,000 residents and employees across the nation have contracted it.
Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu, but determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
The virus is known to be more deadly to aging, immune-compromised people, and small, confined settings like nursing homes, where workers frequently move from one room to the next, are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection. But oversights and failures also have contributed to the crisis.
In interviews with more than two dozen workers in long-term care facilities as well as family members of residents and health care experts, a portrait emerged of a system unequipped to handle the onslaught and disintegrating further amid the growing crisis.
Governors in Texas, Minnesota and other states are looking to ease restrictions.
Texas will let all stores in the state open next week for “retail-to-go,” permitting pickup and delivery but not in-store shopping. Minnesota will allow golf courses and driving ranges to reopen this weekend. Vermont will let its farmers’ markets reopen on May 1.
Around the country, governors began announcing plans to ease restrictions in their states on Friday, even as cases continue to surge in some parts of the country and inadequate testing will make it difficult for them to identify and contain future outbreaks.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said that he would lift restrictions on some medical procedures and reopen state parks while requiring masks and social distancing. Schools will remain closed for the remainder of the school year.
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine described what things might look like beginning May 1: new social distancing guidelines at businesses, employees wearing masks, and staggered arrival times and lunch times.
“Businesses won’t be able to attract workers or customers if they feel they aren’t safe there,” said Mr. DeWine, a Republican. “A lot of this will be common sense and taking what we’ve learned so far and putting it into effect.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Friday that he would refer to the White House guidelines on reopening but not necessarily abide by everything they propose.
“We will obviously use that as a kind of baseline,” Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference in Fort Lauderdale. “It doesn’t mean Florida is going to do every single thing they say or not say.”
But just as much of the country entered life under quarantine in a patchwork fashion, it is poised to ease restrictions the same varied way, responding to the local needs to fight the virus.
In Maryland, where cases and deaths continue to rise, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference Friday that four things must be “solidly in place” before he moves to lift restrictions: expanded testing, increased hospital capacity for a surge in patients, more personal protective equipment, and a robust contact tracing operation. He said that he would give an update on the progress in those areas, and detail the state’s plans, next week. State officials said that schools there would remain closed through at least May 15.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, and the chairman of Disney, Robert A. Iger, as well as the former head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.
Dallas homeless shelter is evacuated after 38 positive tests.A Dallas homeless shelter was evacuated on Friday after 38 residents tested positive for the coronavirus, another example of the pandemic sweeping through one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations.
City officials said 164 residents at the privately run shelter, Dallas Life, were taken by bus to a hotel on Friday, and would be isolated in individual rooms for 14 days while the shelter was cleaned. Nobody was hospitalized, according to the shelter’s director, Bob Sweeney.
Mr. Sweeney said the shelter, which can house as many as 500 people, stopped taking new residents and reduced its staffing to a skeleton crew of about 12 in mid-March, as the pandemic escalated.
About eight days ago, he said, a resident with a fever tested positive for the virus. Two more residents tested positive this week, prompting health officials to order that everyone in the shelter be tested.
Advocates for homeless people said they were not surprised by the outbreak, given the risk that residents, many with respiratory illnesses, face when living in often cramped shelters. A week ago, 70 people at San Francisco’s largest homeless shelter tested positive for the coronavirus in the largest reported outbreak at a single shelter in the United States.
Doctors are prescribing hydroxychloroquine but don’t know if it works.
For weeks doctors around the country have been giving hydroxychloroquine to ill patients, and as a preventive measure to some who have been exposed to the coronavirus.
But even after treating hundreds of patients with the antimalarial drug, doctors interviewed did not report clear results or remarkable recoveries that can be traced to the drug.
At Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, most Covid-19 patients who are not on the verge of dying receive a five-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine, the long-used malaria drug that President Trump has repeatedly promoted as a “what have you got to lose” remedy. While his own top health officials are more cautious — noting there is limited evidence about the drug’s benefits — doctors across the country have been prescribing the drug for weeks.
Dr. Bushra Mina, the chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill, is well aware that there are no rigorous clinical trials showing that the drug works. But he can’t wait for the evidence to come in, he said, when people are dying.
“I think it’s a battle, and your options are very limited,” Dr. Mina said. “You’re really looking for what you can do with whatever evidence you have.”
Hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, have been used for decades to treat and prevent malaria, and hydroxychloroquine has been used by people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis because it is known to calm the immune system. In laboratory tests, it has been shown to block the coronavirus from invading cells, although it hasn’t been proven in human trials. The drugs are not recommended for people who have abnormal heart rhythms.

Those we’ve lost: Israel Sauz, gas-station worker and new father, dies at 22.
Israel Sauz of Tulsa, Okla., couldn’t wait to see his first child, a baby boy named Josiah. And he couldn’t wait for the world to see him, too. So he got in close and took a picture for Facebook of his son, fast asleep in a green onesie, shortly after the boy came into the world one Sunday last month.
Just 21 days later, on April 5, Mr. Sauz was dead. He was 22.The cause was complications related to Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to family friends and the school district where he attended high school.
Many in Tulsa may not have recognized his name, but they knew the smiling face — he was an assistant night manager at a busy QuikTrip gas station and convenience store about a mile east of downtown Tulsa. He was still a teenager when he first started working for QuikTrip, a popular chain based in Tulsa.
He lived in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow. He and his wife, Krystal, had celebrated their first wedding anniversary two weeks before Josiah was born.
Homemade or more professional: Which mask is best for you?
Face masks have become an emblem in the fight against the virus, with officials in the United States and elsewhere recommending — and in some cases mandating — that people wear them to help slow the spread of the deadly outbreak.
Figuring out what to wear is not so easy. N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.
Here’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.
A South Dakota mayor wrestles with the need for a stay-at-home order amid a local outbreak.Mayor Paul TenHaken of Sioux Falls, S.D., has abandoned his effort to put in place a stay-at-home order in his city, which is at the center of a coronavirus outbreak that shut down a Smithfield pork processing plant.
He told the City Council on Friday that new data showed that local hospitals were able to handle an influx of coronavirus patients, The Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported.
Earlier this week, Mr. TenHaken, a Republican, said in an interview that he was frustrated by his inability to convince Sioux Falls residents to stay in their homes. He had unsuccessfully petitioned Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, for a countywide stay-at-home order.
“We’re starting to become a poster child for a lack of response,” he said, noting that hundreds of people in his city had tested positive for the coronavirus, many of whom worked at Smithfield.
The people in his city were deeply divided over his efforts to institute a stay-at-home order. “I have half the city saying, ‘Shut this entire place down and tell me when to come out,’” he said. “And I have the other half saying, ‘Don’t you dare.’”
Tim Cook, Bob Iger, Janet Yellen and former governors join California’s bipartisan economic advisory council.Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, and the chairman of Disney, Robert A. Iger, as well as the former head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.
The former governors are two Republicans, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and two Democrats, Gray Davis and Jerry Brown. The committee will be led by Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman and former presidential candidate.
Mr. Steyer said the committee’s aim would be “to develop a strategy to help California recover as fast as safely possible from the Covid-19 induced recession.”
“Health and safety remain the most important points here,” Mr. Steyer said.Mr. Newsom’s initiative to call on his predecessors is in contrast to President Trump who was asked in March whether he would consult with previous presidents for guidance on how to navigate the crisis. “I don’t think I’m going to learn much,” Mr. Trump said at the time.
Small Business Administration loans have so far flowed heavily to California and Texas.Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.
The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.
The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent or about $45 billion worth.
The program was designed for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure advantaged companies with existing relationships with banks.
S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.
Meanwhile, stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage.
The gains came after Mr. Trump told governors they could begin reopening, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.
The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the much of the country most nonessential work. The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.
After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the economic damage, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. Friday’s gains mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claim
Epidemiologists still don’t know the worldwide death rate for Covid-19.
Coroners in some parts of the United States are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in virus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed plenty dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died, recent data shows.
Those supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography: Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly one-tenth of Italy’s, and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan, at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at about 0.7 percent.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others, raising the question of why there appears to be so much variance from country to country.
With social distancing difficult on ships, the crew of the Mercy, a Navy hospital, moves ashore.
Aboard the hospital ship U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in the Port of Los Angeles, most of the military crew is moving off the ship and into hotels ashore. Sailors will be bussed from their hotels to to work their shifts aboard the Mercy. Navy spokesman Lt. Andrew Bertucci said on Friday that the decision was made in order to better facilitate social distancing.
“The plan is to drastically decrease the amount of contact that the crew has with each other,” Lieutenant Bertucci said. “It will ultimately be safer for both the crew and the patients.”
Between 800 to 900 crew members had been living on the Mercy full-time, but that number will go down to about 100 to 200 in the coming days. On Thursday 150 sailors moved off the ship, and that same number is expected to move to hotels daily through Sunday. Lieutenant Bertucci noted that the crew aboard the U.S.N.S. Comfort, which is docked in New York City, recently moved most of its crew to hotels ashore as well.
The move comes after a total of seven crew members tested positive for Covid-19 since the ship arrived to help area hospitals treat non-Covid patients, and more than 100 of the crew who had been in contact with those seven have moved off the ship into precautionary quarantine. All of the Mercy sailors in quarantine have tested negative for the coronavirus and are regularly monitored in case they were to develop any symptoms.
The commanding officer of the Mercy’s medical treatment team, Capt. John Rotruck, is quarantined aboard the ship in his stateroom after an investigation found that he had been in proximity to a Covid-positive crew member. Captain Rotruck has tested negative for novel coronavirus, and said his ability to continue the ship’s mission is unchanged.
The ship will continue to treat the patients it already has onboard, and will take new patients as requested by local authorities.
There are 29 dead at one N.Y. nursing home. Or more. No one will say.Berna Lee got the call from the nursing home in Queens on April 3: Her mother had a fever, nothing serious. She was assured that there were no cases in the home. Then she started calling workers there.
“One said, ‘Girl, let me tell you, it’s crazy here,’” Ms. Lee said. “‘Six people died today.’”In a panic, Ms. Lee drove from her home in Rhode Island to the nursing home, beginning a two-week scramble for information, as workers at the facility, Sapphire Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing of Central Queens, told her privately that many residents had died, and that most of the home’s leadership was out sick or in quarantine.
Finally, she banged on her mother’s first-floor window to see if she was OK. It was unclear whether her mother understood what was happening, Ms. Lee said.
“I didn’t know how bad it was,” she said. “People told me bodies were dropping.”The crisis at Sapphire highlighted the desperate state of nursing homes in the New York region and illustrated what relatives of residents said was a deeply troubling lack of information about what was going on inside the homes.
China’s economy shrinks for first time in decades, and the death toll in Wuhan is revised higher.
Chinese officials on Friday said the world’s second-largest economy had shrunk in the first three months of the year, ending a streak of untrammeled growth that survived the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the SARS epidemic and even the global financial crisis.
The data reflects China’s drastic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.
The stark numbers make clear how monumental the challenge of getting the global economy back on its feet will be, and may help to explain why world leaders — including President Trump — are so eager to restart their own economies. Since it emerged from abject poverty and isolation more than 40 years ago, China has become perhaps the world’s most important growth engine.
But the leaders in Beijing have faced criticism over a lack of transparency in their handling of the epidemic.
Faced with mounting skepticism over its official figures, China on Friday revised up its death toll in the central city where the coronavirus first emerged.
Officials in the city, Wuhan, placed the new tally at 3,869 deaths, an increase of 1,290, or 50 percent, from the previous figure. The number of confirmed infections in the city was also revised upward to 50,333, an increase of 325.
Officials in Wuhan said the revised death toll now included those who died at home in the early days of the outbreak, as well as deaths that were not properly reported by hospitals or registered on death certificates.

Doctors raise alarm about health effects of continued coronavirus shutdown: ‘Mass casualty incident’ – More than 600 doctors signed onto a letter sent to President Trump Tuesday pushing him to end the “national shutdown” aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, calling the widespread state orders keeping businesses closed and kids home from school a “mass casualty incident” with “exponentially growing health consequences.”

The letter outlines a variety of consequences that the doctors have observed resulting from the coronavirus shutdowns, including patients missing routine checkups that could detect things like heart problems or cancer, increases in substance and alcohol abuse, and increases in financial instability that could lead to “overty and financial uncertainty,” which “is closely linked to poor health.” – READ MORE

Trump, in Michigan: ‘We’re not going to close the country’ if there’s a 2nd wave of coronavirus cases – President Trump acknowledged Thursday that there could be a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic later this year, but flatly stated he wouldn’t let any further outbreaks shutter the economy again.

“People say that’s a very distinct possibility,” Trump said when asked a possible second wave while in Michigan. “It’s standard. And, we’re going put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country.” – READ MORE

Coronavirus-triggered layoffs in US hit nearly 39 million – The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.

More than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said. – READ MORE

JPMorgan study finds COVID-19 infection rates have declined — not increased — in states that have reopened – A report by JPMorgan finds that COVID-19 infection rates have declined, not increased, in states that have reopened. The eye-opening study from the investment banking institution was shared by CNBC financial anchor Carl Quintanilla in a series of tweets.

Research by JPMorgan shows that the coronavirus infection rates of states that have ended their lockdowns have declined, “even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag.” The incubation period for coronavirus has a median time of four to five days, and as long as 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. – READ MORE

Here's how some of the biggest industry names are making ends meet and trying to reinvent themselves in a new, remote world.","How do you make a living off of travel in a world that can't travel?

That's the question thousands of workers across the world are facing as global travel has ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The airline and hotel industries have been devastated. Companies like Marriott and Expedia have slashed their advertising budgets, creating a domino effect on the news media that relies heavily on ad revenue. Gannett, the largest US newspaper company, has made pay cuts and put many staffers on partial furlough. McClatchy, owner of 30 US newspapers, said in April that it would lay off four executives and furlough about 115 employees. Vox Media furloughed about 100 employees and halted all pay increases for the rest of 2020.

Travel media, already a fragile industry, is also poised to take a hard hit. Legacy travel magazines like Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler have been hit by pay cuts, as well as content and freelance budget cuts. Digital media companies that built their brands off of helping their readers travel the globe, such as The Points Guy, have seen a drop in credit card sign-ups. Travel influencers and freelance writers across the world have found themselves with no work.

Rafat Ali, the CEO of Skift, a travel news and industry intelligence company, told Business Insider that the pain is likely only beginning for the media industry.

""I think some of the layoffs in the media industry are too small,"" Ali said. ""I think it's unfortunately going to be a lot worse than people are imagining in terms of the hurt the media will have to go through.""

'Different stages of hurt'

Per Ali, many major media organizations have made the mistake of covering travel as a leisure, not as a business.

""I think that the biggest disservice that the travel industry has done to itself is to market itself as a leisure. And what that means is it's also disposable, which means that it's the first thing that gets cut in media in general,"" Ali said, pointing to the New York Times' recent decision to temporarily stop publishing its travel section in its Sunday print edition.

The pandemic has ushered in an ""age of news,"" and many travel magazines focus on longer feature pieces rather than hard news, according to Ali.

""They're not built for the metabolism that this time needs,"" he said.

Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure, the two legacy brands that dominate the travel magazine scene, have both encountered major challenges since the pandemic first brought life in the US to a halt eight weeks ago. And smaller travel magazines such as Afar, which lack the resources of larger publications, could face even more distress.

""I wouldn't be surprised — not that there are even many travel magazines left — but I wouldn't be surprised if there are even less left in the next year,"" Ali told Business Insider.

Many of the biggest companies that advertise with travel magazines are suffering themselves. In mid-March, Airbnb suspended all of its marketing activities. A week later, on March 19, Marriott CEO Arne Morris Sorenson said that the world's largest hotel company's advertising budget had ""gone dark."" Expedia normally spends $5 billion on advertising but plans to spend less than $1 billion in 2020.

Some travel magazines had relatively robust sales at newsstands and airports before the pandemic, Ali said. But now, with virtually nobody traveling or going to newsstands, ""they're all, I'm sure, in different stages of hurt,"" he said.

Readers want travel content that answers their practical travel questions right now

Condé Nast Traveler's parent company, Condé Nast, announced pay cuts for its highest-earning staff and said it could announce layoffs by the end of May. Condé Nast Traveler has not laid off any staffers, but it has reduced its freelance budget and made cuts to its content budget, a spokesperson for the magazine told Business Insider. Many of the magazine's advertising partners have postponed campaigns until later in the year after the travel sector opens back up.

The magazine did not provide Business Insider with specific numbers for how advertising revenue had been affected, but Jesse Ashlock, Condé Nast Traveler's US Editor, described a bleak outlook.

""I'm not going to lie and say that we're healthy right now,"" Ashlock told Business Insider. ""It's a tough time. We've had a precipitous decline in the second quarter and we anticipate that continuing into the third quarter.""

Condé Nast Traveler has pivoted from conventional destination-oriented coverage toward both coronavirus coverage and ""pure inspo,"" as Ashlock describes it.

""People want to know about how coronavirus is impacting airline policies, booking policies, when am I gonna be able to travel again, all those kinds of fundamental questions that anybody who loves travel is going to have right now,"" he said. ""And people also want permission to dream, to just have a kind of escape hatch in a way that travel can also provide.""

Readers want practical information on how the coronavirus is affecting travel right now, Ashlock says. Condé Nast Traveler

Travel + Leisure's parent company, Meredith, has frozen hiring and implemented sweeping pay cuts for 60% of its employees, but has not announced any layoffs.

The magazine saw a 14% increase in unique visitors to its website in March as compared to the same time period in 2019, according to figures from media analytics company Comscore. While April's Comscore numbers were not yet available at the time of publication, the spokesperson said that, per internal reporting, the magazine did not see the same boost in readership in April.

""In general, the media landscape is really challenging right now,"" Jacqueline Gifford, Travel + Leisure's editor-in-chief, told Business Insider.

Like Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure has had to adjust its coverage to the times. Gifford said the magazine, which prints 12 issues per year, held off on publishing a planned piece on Italy's Emilia Romagna region — one of the hardest-hit by the virus — that had been in the works for a year. The magazine's new mix of coverage includes practical tips such as how to get airline refunds, pieces on virtual travel, and stories like an essay about learning to love wherever you are.

While travel magazines may be adapting in the short term, the worst may be yet to come, according to Skift's Ali.

""Advertising will be hurt even when the recovery starts,"" Ali told Business Insider. ""... There's businesses that will close, tour operators and travel agents, that advertise a lot in these fancy magazines. Destinations will be hurt.""

Businesses will still need to advertise, but whether they will splurge for space in travel magazines remains to be seen, he said.

Lucrative digital media companies are waiting out the pandemic

Meanwhile, digital media companies whose business models seem based on affiliate revenue seem better positioned to weather the downturn.

The Points Guy, a profitable travel and credit-card-rewards website also known as TPG, rakes in affiliate fees by getting readers to sign up for credit cards or reward programs. Every time someone signs up for a credit card or rewards program via the site, the company collects anywhere from $25 to $700, a former editorial employee previously told Business Insider.

But in a global pandemic that has halted travel and left millions jobless, not many people are signing up for credit cards or travel rewards programs.

TPG has seen ""a massive drop"" in credit card sign-ups, a current employee told Business Insider. Some of the company's bank partners, including Bank of America and Capital One, have pulled all affiliate links from TPG, according to internal emails reviewed by Business Insider.

A spokesperson for Capital One declined to comment on the record about its affiliate marketing activities, but CEO Richard Fairbank said in an earnings call on April 23 that the company is ""pulling back on marketing in the near term"" due to the coronavirus. A spokesperson for Bank of America also declined to comment.

TPG has not announced any layoffs or pay cuts, but some employees may be temporarily reassigned to other brands owned by TPG's parent company, Red Ventures, the employee said.

But TPG may have the resources to weather the crisis. The company has been profitable every year it has existed, CEO Brian Kelly told Digiday in 2019. In the year before the pandemic, it made upwards of $50 million in profit, according to the current employee.

""They were very cash rich to begin with going into this, so at minimum they have tons of cash reserve, not just them, but their parent company [Red Ventures] as well,"" says Ali. ""... Their business, which is credit cards, I'm sure is hurt a lot, but again, they have the money.""

Business Insider reached out to TPG and Red Ventures for comment on this article. TPG did not respond to the request directly but declined through Red Ventures. Red Ventures also declined to comment.

While TPG is one of the most prominent travel media start-ups, it's not the only one that relies heavily on affiliate revenue. Nomadic Matt, a travel website founded by Matt Kepnes, usually makes money through affiliate bookings, advertising revenue, events, and book sales. But in the second week of March, there was an immediate drop.

""There are no affiliate revenues, no one's booking travel,"" Kepnes told Business Insider. ""I think I made like a hundred bucks last month.""

A post shared by Matt Kepnes | Nomadic Matt (@nomadicmatt) Apr 22, 2020 at 12:59pm PDT

Thanks to assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a $349 billion relief fund of government-backed loans for small businesses, Kepnes hasn't had to lay off his four employees. He thinks the business will be able to stay afloat until the fall.

""I think by then people will start booking again,"" he said. ""Will it be as good as it was pre-COVID? No. But we have pretty low expenses other than salaries, so I'm not too worried. We had a lot in the bank.""

From getting paid for their travels across the globe to having nowhere to go

Travel influencers and freelance writers, who not too long ago were the envy of everyone who dreams of quitting their corporate job and getting paid to travel, now find themselves with no work — and often, with no safety net.

Even as people stuck in their homes are spending more time on social media, brands are slashing influencer marketing budgets, deferring payments, and postponing campaigns, devastating income for travel influencers, as Amanda Perelli and Dan Whateley recently reported for Business Insider.

A post shared by Oneika Raymond🇨🇦🇯🇲 (@oneikatraveller) Apr 28, 2020 at 9:43am PDT

Travel blogger Oneika Raymond, who has more than 84,500 Instagram followers, told Perelli and Whateley that ""companies are reluctant to take on anything new and therefore that is impacting the income of creators."" Another travel influencer, Lauren Bullen, who lives in Bali and has 2.1 million Instagram followers, said all her paid trips had been canceled.

Jimmy Im is a freelance travel writer who left a full-time staff job at CNBC Make It in September 2019 and has written for publications including Business Insider, Condé Nast Traveler, and Travel + Leisure. In a typical pre-pandemic month, he was traveling for two to three weeks and producing between two and six commissioned stories.

Then, in March, when he was in the Catskills in upstate New York working on three stories, the coronavirus was declared a pandemic. Two of his Catskills stories were canceled, and things went downhill from there.

""Work is nonexistent,"" Im told Business Insider at the end of April. ""Nobody is taking travel stories right now … Since the pandemic and the lockdowns, I've had zero, zero work.""

Im has had to cancel upcoming trips to Argentina and Florida and is living off of his savings and unemployment benefits. He's stayed busy working on his novel and his personal travel blog, but he's worried about how he's going to keep paying rent on his Manhattan apartment past July.

Travel blogger Kiersten Rich of The Blonde Abroad, who has upwards of 561,000 Instagram followers, told Business Insider that traffic to her blog has dwindled by 50% since January, leading to a drop in ad revenue and decreased affiliate link payouts. At least four of her contracted travel campaigns are on hold, she says.

In the meantime, Rich has pivoted to posting about home goods, self-improvement, and self-care on her blog and Instagram account. She expects the travel blogging industry to become even more competitive going forward.

""There will still be budgets for marketing, and destinations will be looking to attract visitors as soon as it's safe to travel again, but I think those brands will be more selective about who they work with, and on what platform,"" she said.

Silver linings

Despite travel media's current state of turmoil, some remain hopeful about the future of the industry. As Ali of Skift put it, not being able to travel has made the world realize just how important travel is.

Ashlock of Condé Nast Traveler says the pandemic may force travel publications to finally diversify their revenue streams.

""This is quite indicative of how challenging it can be to rely so heavily on advertising, and so that's something we're going to have to look closely at as we go forward,"" he said.

Kepnes of Nomadic Matt, meanwhile, is squaring up against the state of complete uncertainty ahead.

""Now, what happens after the summer? I don't really know,"" Kepnes said. ""I like to be optimistic, because if you're a pessimist, then how do you get through the day?""",real

1176,17,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/cdc-expert-says-coronavirus-not-controllable-will-spread/,2020-02-10,CDC Expert Says Coronavirus Is Not Controllable & Will Spread,"CDC intelligence officer, researcher, and vaccine deployment expert admits to the coronavirus pandemic being beyond control and that it will spread globally.

Although some of the media is trying to downplay the coronavirus pandemic, and some even suggest that it is not real, footage is being leaked, and some establishment scientists are even warning that this outbreak may not be able to be contained.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier works for the CDC and previously was an epidemic intelligence officer with the Deputy director for Infectious Diseases under the CDC, as well as being an anthrax researcher and an African vaccine deployment expert. Messonnier was quoted as saying,“We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic,” and reiterating that it, “would be impossible” to fully contain the virus and prevent the outbreak from spreading.

Her word-for-word quote from Bloomberg reads:

“Total containment isn’t in the cards, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down… We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.”

According to a CNN report she was also quoted as saying when speaking about quarantines of people traveling from China:

“It’s important to know that this strategy is not meant to catch every single traveler returning from China with novel coronavirus,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press briefing Monday. “Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible. But working together, we can catch the majority of them.” and the goal is “to slow the entry of this virus into the United States,” she said.

The quotes contradict other statements being given by the CDC, the mainstream media, and W.H.O; these authoritative sources are portraying the outbreak of the coronavirus as being under control and posing no threat to western nations. Yet here we have Messonnier who is a mid level scientist who probably is hard working and believes that she is trying to help humanity and carrying out good science in public interest, who is speaking something different than what we are being told to believe.

Her statement about the coronavirus appears as if she is trying to warn the world about what could happen. Messonnier is an expert in infectious disease, she can do the math and is able to see where this outbreak is heading with its exponential growth rate which is notably a reported 20% daily increase in infections that will double the number of infections around every 3.6 days, according to the rule of 72 estimates, or roughly twice a week.

Reportedly there are 10,000 people infected, this means that there will be another 40,000 infected in a little over a week later. However, most people can’t do the math, and don’t understand why a 20% daily increase will compound to a nearly 400% aggregate in just over 7-8 days. The rule of 72 may help to explain why the math checks out, as compounding interest/exponential growth is a powerful phenomenon.

It can be assumed that in Messonnier’s best judgement she is trying to warn everyone. The coronavirus appears to have broken containment going by rate of spread, she is aware that the best strategy now would be mitigation, and that America could become the latest battleground fighting to reduce the impact of the virus if it spreads from the cities here that are already known to have cases of infection. Going by available information, her background, education, and experience Messonnier seems to be a pretty smart cookie who wants to help save lives with her extensive knowledge, thus it is highly unlikely she would have made those statements without there being merit to warrant it.

Here in America the CDC still has a chance to contain the first wave of infection from the coronavirus, but the window of opportunity is mostly likely shrinking rapidly. Best guesses estimate that those odds are about 50/50 at containing the first wave, no doubt the CDC is working hard to track and isolate those who have been exposed in containment attempts. However, given what is known about the virus being symptomless until it is too late, there being several confirmed cases here already, and the virus continuing to demonstrate its self sustained airborne replication in countries outside of China means that America’s odds of having a perfect containment record, in all honesty, are dwindling quickly.

Interestingly enough Messonnier has been openly invited to write her own article on the coronavirus by a few news organizations outside of the mainstream media, many hope that she is allowed to do so.

Meanwhile video footage has recently been uploaded of disinfection work in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. It appears as if China is spraying entire city blocks, that normally would have been packed with people, in attempts to contain further outbreaks; lines of trucks and huge machines can be seen rolling down empty streets blasting plumes of white mist spray, and modified rickshaws sporting sanitizer cannons. Hopefully it doesn’t get this far anywhere else, and the outbreak really has been contained as we are being told.",fake

Editor, Health Impact News

We have featured the articles published by Michigan physician Dr. David Brownstein for many years here at Health Impact News.

But we were just notified that his blog has been shut down, apparently to suppress the information he was publishing that went against Big Pharma and their narrative regarding COVID-19.

As we have previously reported, Dr. Brownstein has had tremendous success treating COVID-19 patients successfully with holistic non-pharmaceutical methods.

According to a notice put up on his website, the FTC ordered him to stop blogging:

Dear CHM Patients-

I want to let you know that we have been ordered by the FTC to stop making any statements about our treatment protocols of Vitamins A, C and D as well as nutritional IV’s, iodine, ozone and nebulization to support the immune system with respect to Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). According to this letter: “It is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C Sec. 41 et seq. to advertise that a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products or services identified above. Thus, any Coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products or services are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims.” What this means is that I will not be able to blog, post, tweet, email, etc. for awhile. I want you to know that CHM is NOT closing. I am still here and so are my colleagues. It is my honor to be your doctor. To All Our Health! ~DrB

The articles we have published on our website authored by Dr. Brownstein remain, and are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

Unfortunately, as a licensed physician, Dr. Brownstein has stricter regulations on what he can publish since he charges for his services.

This does NOT mean he has done anything wrong or illegal, it just probably means he has neither the time nor resources to fight this in court right now, where he would probably win on Constitutional grounds.

This was one of Dr. Brownstein’s last blog entries regarding the wearing of masks, which criticized Governor Whitmer (which is NOT illegal!).

We Must Wear Face Masks? Show Me the Science Behind That!

by Dr. Brownstein

Folks, I have been writing to you about COVID for over a month. It is been a painful time period for all of us.

What is really sad is that too many political dictates are being fostered on us without any good scientific evidence to back them up. One of those requirements that has me irritated is the use of face coverings that I see so prevalent out there.

When I go to Costco, 95% of the people in the store are wearing face masks.

Why is that?

The Governor of Michigan recently released an edict requiring that citizens wear a face covering when in any enclosed public space.

It specifically states, “Any individual able to medically tolerate a face covering must wear a covering over his or her nose and mouth—such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandana, or handkerchief—when in any enclosed public space.”

Later in the edict, it states, “Supplies of N95 masks and surgical masks should generally be reserved, for now, for health care professionals, first responders and other critical workers who interact with the public.”

It should be well known that cloth masks, bandanas, or handkerchiefs will do very little to stop the spread of coronavirus. In fact, they may actually increase your risk of becoming ill from corona and other influenza-like illnesses.

A 2015 study found cloth masks, when compared to surgical masks, increase the rate of influenza-like illnesses 13x! (1) Cloth masks are probably best avoided and should not be reused without properly sanitizing them.

Regular surgical masks are not much better in this situation. The COVID-19 virus is 0.125 µm in size. Surgical masks have been shown to not adequately filter against aerosols measuring from 0.9-3.1 µm. (2)

Other researchers have shown that particles from 0.04-0.2 µm can penetrate surgical masks. (3)

A 2020 study in Seoul, South Korea looked at the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in blocking COVID-19 in a controlled comparison of four patients. (4)

The COVID-infected patients were put in negative pressure isolated rooms. The scientists compared disposable surgical masks (3 layers) with reusable cotton masks.

Patients were instructed to cough 5 times while wearing no mask, surgical mask, or cotton mask. Interestingly, all swabs from the outer masks—including surgical masks—were positive for COVID-19.

Inner masks were also found to be contaminated. That means the mask did not effectively filter out the COVID virus since it is too small. The authors state, “Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered {COVID-19} during coughs by infected patients.”

The study also reported greater contamination on the outer than the inner mask (both surgical and cotton) surfaces.

The authors claim that the mask is either allowing the virus to cross from the inner to the outer surface because the virus is too small or the aerodynamic feature of a mask could explain this finding. A turbulent jet due to air leakage around the mask edge could contaminate the outer surface.

We have made far too many political decisions in the COVID crisis based on fear and not on reliable data. Here is a perfect example of another one: everyone must wear a mask when inside any public place.

Should you wear a mask? If you are coughing or sick, my answer is yes. A surgical mask, and to a lesser extent a cotton mask, will block large droplets from being spread.

However, should we dictate to healthy people that they are required to wear a mask—cotton or surgical—when in any public enclosed space? Someone show me the science supporting the Executive Order by the Governor of Michigan. And Governor Whitmer wonders why so many of us are annoyed.

To All Our Health,

~DrB

Addendum: A further annoyance is my lack of success in getting masks—both N95 and surgical masks– for my staff to use when we are treating COVID patients. Perhaps the Governor should release an executive order helping us get the PPE equipment we need. We have had masks, gowns and face shields on order for over two months. That is beyond annoying.

“The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”

Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)

“Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.

It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.

Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.

It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.

As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.

“If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”

Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.",fake

After that experiment to boost passenger capacity failed to sit well with commuters, the CTA introduced new rail cars outfitted mostly with center-facing seats to accommodate the crush-loading of cars to as many as 120 people. Such close contact was well above the goal of a later “de-crowding’’ initiative aimed at reducing human freight to 70 to 75 people per car on average.

Opinion

It’s unclear whether anything resembling the tin-of-sardines transit experience will ever return in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing. But I don’t know how you take the mass out of mass transit.

Amidst staggering losses currently at the farebox that may take years to recover from, it now appears that the pre-pandemic challenges to accommodate the ridership gains of years’ past were a good problem for the CTA, and Metra, to have.

Until now, transportation, and particularly mass transit, were considered part of the go-to solution to deal with just about any catastrophe. Downtown Chicago was evacuated in short order after the terrorist attacks on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.

Yet when the reality finally set in late this winter about the lethal threat posed by the novel coronavirus, health officials across the country issued a proclamation that previously seemed unimaginable: The public, except for essential workers including medical and safety personnel commuting to their jobs, should stay off trains and buses until further notice.

Transit ridership has plunged since Illinois’ stay-at-home order took effect on March 21. The few people still riding have posted photos on social media showing them having entire train coaches and buses almost all to themselves. Transit officials have tried, meanwhile, to reassure these diehard customers that seats, grab poles and hanging straps are being wiped down daily to minimize the spread of disease.

CTA ridership has plunged about 80 percent since Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order. Metra ridership is in an even bigger free-fall, projected to be down 97 percent in April compared with the same month a year ago, officials said.

“Commuter rail will not be the same after COVID-19,” Tom Farmer, Metra’s chief financial officer, told the Metra board during an online meeting on April 15. “We have just been crushed.’’

It’s a transit doomsday warning that far exceeds Chicago-area transit agencies’ cries for financial help in the early 2000s. A CTA budget shortfall in 2009 led the transit agency to impose service cuts in 2010 on more than 100 bus routes and seven rail lines. The drastic schedule changes prompted commuters to make new travel choices. But they eventually circled back to their preferred method of getting around this congested region. By 2012, CTA ridership reached its highest level in 22 years, adding some 13 million rides compared to 2011.

Before the ongoing public health emergency, the Chicago region’s transit agencies were already weighed down by a backlog of infrastructure improvement needs totaling billions of dollars. The formidable burdens, new and old, will not fade without concerted action at the local, state and federal levels and an openness to trying new ideas.

But instead of joining Metra’s gloomy long-term outlook for public transit, I’m reminded about a cable that Mark Twain sent from London to the press in the United States after the mistaken publication of his obituary: “Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.’’

1197,1902,https://www.rt.com/news/489585-gaza-coronavirus-death-palestine/,2020-05-23,"FIRST coronavirus death confirmed in Gaza, as Palestinian territories lift lockdown","The death of a 77-year-old woman in the Gaza Strip marks the enclave’s first coronavirus fatality, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported. The illness has so far claimed three lives across the Palestinian territories.

The victim, who had been suffering from a prior illness, recently entered Gaza from Egypt and was quarantined on arrival. The Palestinian Health Ministry announced her death on Saturday.

The woman is the first coronavirus patient to die in the 41km-long patch of territory, whose 1.8 million residents are walled off from Israel to the north and east, and from Egypt to the south. Three deaths have now been recorded by the authorities in Gaza and the West Bank, and another two in Jerusalem, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.

Also on rt.com How on earth is Palestine supposed to cope with Covid-19 – and where is the international outcry?

The Palestinian territories have fared relatively well throughout the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 423 cases have been recorded by the health ministry – just 83 per million people. By contrast, neighboring Israel has seen nearly 280 deaths and 17,000 cases, or 1,900 per million.

However, the low number of infections likely reflects the limited testing capacity in the territories. Ventilators are a scarce commodity, and, even before the pandemic, the Israeli blockade of Gaza was highlighted by the World Health Organization as hindering Palestinians’ access to quality healthcare. Across the Palestinian territories as a whole, fewer than 80 intensive-care unit (ICU) beds are available to treat the sickest patients.

Still, with case numbers low and no patients needing these ICU beds at present, the Palestinian authorities eased the lockdown measures in the West Bank on Monday, reopening stores and permitting local travel. Nonetheless, a wholesale ban on movement between cities and towns was not lifted in time for Saturday’s feast of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The event promises to be a powerful rendition of classic songs celebrating the sacrifices of veterans across the United Kingdom and the Allied victory over Nazism on the Western Front.

The Royal Albert Hall, named by Queen Victoria after her late husband, Prince Albert, remains one of the UK's most iconic concert venues hosting leading acts from across the world since opening its doors in 1871.

Royal Albert Hall chief executive, Craig Hassall, discussed the unprecedented Victory Day performance and its significance, including ways people can continue to support the arts, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Sputnik: What is special about the RAH's 75th VE Day performance? What is its significance and does it symbolise anything for your venue amid the ongoing pandemic?

Craig Hassall: This is the first behind-closed-doors performance in the Hall’s 150-year history. We had originally scheduled a VE Day performance for the 8 May, one of many shows which ultimately had to be cancelled due to the pandemic.

The Hall has always been a place of national celebration and commemoration, where poignant anniversaries are observed, and while we’ve staged ‘at home’ versions of other cancelled shows – with artists coming direct from their living rooms – that wouldn’t have been right for this event.

With the venue closed for the first time since the Blitz, we felt there was something incredibly powerful about staging a performance in an empty Hall. I also know that, for many, the words of ‘We’ll Meet Again’ have taken on a special significance in recent weeks, especially after being used by Queen Elizabeth II in her recent address to the nation, and it seemed fitting that Katherine Jenkins should perform that song as a virtual duet with Vera Lynn.

The event promises to be an extremely moving communal experience for people all over the world.

Sputnik: What kinds of support was provided to the venue and artist Katherine Jenkins OBE during the course of rehearsals?

Craig Hassall: It has involved a huge amount of planning, with the safety of everyone involved – artists, crew and staff – of paramount importance. We have a fantastic relationship with Katherine and were thrilled that she wanted to be involved.

The help we have had from her team, promoter Snappin’ Turtle, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA) armed forces charity, YouTube and the Mayor of London’s office in making this event happen, has been truly extraordinary and we’re so grateful to them.

Paradise, Andy Craig Hassall, Royal Albert Hall CEO. 21 April 2017

Sputnik: How has the Royal Albert Hall been affected by the COVID-19 lockdown, and how can people support the venue in these difficult times?

Craig Hassall: We are facing enormous financial challenges at the moment. From March to May, we would have expected to take in around £8.5m, instead we refunded £3m in tickets.

We’re doing our best to keep entertaining the world during our closure, but our famous building is at risk, and the show can’t go on without support and donations. So now is really the chance for anyone who loves this place to show their appreciation and help us protect the future of the Royal Albert Hall.

Sputnik: What kinds of feedback have you received from audiences watching the online streams? Do you believe such performances will inspire interest in the arts amongst new demographics once the lockdown has been lifted?

Craig Hassall: We’ve had an incredible response to the Royal Albert Home series so far, with shows being streamed more than half a million times and audiences getting in touch from Kentucky to Kazakhstan to tell us how much the performances have meant to them during a difficult time.

— Mayor of London (gov.uk/coronavirus) (@MayorofLondon) May 7, 2020

The Hall exists promote a love of the arts and sciences, and during the closure this project has become a central part of that. It’s a new way for us to reach audiences – opening up our events to anyone with an internet connection – and something that we’re committed to continuing even after our re-opening.

Opinion contributor

We are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership’s proposals to immunize businesses from accountability if they follow “government guidelines” for operating “safely.” They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually jeopardize both workers and consumers and damage our economic recovery.

Many companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But immunizing all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.

First, no authoritative guidelines exist. The Trump administration recently blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s detailed reopening guidelines for certain industries because they were overly prescriptive, according to The Associated Press.

The only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer ""recommendations” rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.

We know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.

OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines

American Association for Justice:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic

The Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting immunity, recently wrote that a “one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.”

This is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works — to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn’t add another layer of broad immunity based on phantom guidelines and politicians’ whims.

It was a show like no other for country music star Keith Urban.

Instead of people standing together in a massive auditorium or on a field like at past shows, the audience members for this surprise performance, all health care workers, watched the ""We Were"" singer from their cars, parked 6 feet apart.

""It felt amazing to be playing,"" Urban said. ""People were honking horns and flicking headlights. ... It was really magical.""

The surprise concert Urban performed on Thursday was held at the Stardust Drive-In Movie Theater, about 40 miles east of Nashville, Tennessee. He was one of the first artists in the country to perform a live show in front of an audience since the onset of the pandemic.

Almost 125 vehicles filled the parking lot for the unannounced show, which was only for doctors, nurses, EMTs and staff from Vanderbilt Health, a division of Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

""So we had the idea for the drive-in ... over a month ago,"" Urban said. ""It's an obvious venue because you're playing to people in cars, which is such a great way to keep the distance between everybody in a safe environment, but the venue is already built.""

""We just set about figuring it out, how to do it in a safe way,"" he continued. ""The crew could be minimized. Musicians on stage could be minimal, everything just had to be very, very minimal.""

Urban and his crew's decision to hold a concert using this format was a huge first step as the world of live music tries to find its footing amid the ongoing pandemic.

""Just freezing and stopping and doing nothing is just not an option,"" Urban said. ""So, how do we move forward, steadily, methodically, not just for us but for the audience too? The audience is out there and they want to come and see something but they want to feel like it's a safe environment and everything's been thought through.""

Concerts and festivals haven't been immune to the nationwide stay-at-home orders. The music industry is preparing to lose an estimated $9 billion in ticket sales, according to a study published by the trade publication Pollster.

Some of today's biggest entertainers are finding new ways to adapt and connect with fans.

Doja Cat's song ""Say So"" became a No. 1 hit, fueled by a TikTok dance craze. Artists like Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber and Drake have filmed quarantine-themed videos. Legendary DJs have turned their living rooms into night clubs and live streamed dance sets.

""One amazing thing that we've seen is that artists are feeling they're still entertainers and they still want to bring people together,"" said Puja Patel, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork. ""We've seen everyone from Cardi B to Diplo ... take over their Instagram Lives. ... Travis Scott did a concert within Fortnite.""

""It's been really special to see so many musicians come together for their fans and to know that fans really need them right now and they need kind of that escape,"" she added.

Patel said livestreaming is crucial right now for artists while everyone is stuck at home.

""So many people are turning to mobile devices for entertainment,"" she said. ""I think this will get us through, but believe live music will return in a public facing way. For now, I think these shows are the way we move forward.""

Derrick Jones, whose stage name is ""D-Nice,"" has been called a hero for his livestream sets dubbed ""Club Quarantine,"" streaming for hours on end and breaking the internet with as many as 100,000 viewers. Guests for that show included Michelle Obama, the Kardashians and Mark Zuckerberg.

""I started DJ-ing and, listen, the energy was just different, it really felt like a party,"" Jones said. ""Then I would read the comments and then say, 'Wow, I was putting out energy,' but based on what people were saying, I could really feel the energy.""

""That's when I realized this thing has legs,"" he continued. ""This is a good thing that's happening and it just keeps going.""

But for someone who built his career on the road performing for big audiences, he says it's not the same.

""Before the pandemic, I was on the plane every few days. My gigs were all over,"" Jones said. ""Once the pandemic hit, I had to be still and sit at home. I honestly didn't know what to do because I almost didn't recognize this was my residence because I was never here.""

It's a sentiment shared by people in jobs all over the industry. Longtime production manager Chris Gratton said there are many others in the business who are being forgotten in the pandemic.

""It's really affected the 12 million people in the entertainment business, you know, live entertainment in the U.S. alone,"" Gratton said. ""I mean, we have caterers, there's the popcorn poppers, the ushers, the parking lot people. It's not just the roadies.""

Gratton said it's these unsung heroes who have been hit the hardest.

""We go to the studio, do work with the artists and the dancers and the choreographers and designers and work throughout the day ... going through setlists, getting everything advanced,"" he said.

He said his team was supposed to kick off Justin Bieber's ""Changes"" tour on Friday in Seattle.

""This would have been the day we would have finished production rehearsal,"" he said. ""It's kind of sad for me and the fellas that we're not doing that today, but our time will come. So we will be back.""

A roadie for over 30 years, working for artists like Ariana Grande, Kanye West and J Balvin, Gratton said he's never seen anything like this.

""Man, the only thing that even comes close at all would be 9/11,"" he said. ""Everybody was afraid to fly. So everybody postponed or canceled for a few weeks. But that was a few weeks, the maximum a month. And then everybody got back up to it. And, you know, it was scary, but it's the only thing we ever got close to this.""

Gratton spends around 10 months a year on the road. Now he and 87 employees on his team are out of work. He said he's worried about his crew and their families being able to put food on their tables.

""We're going to get to that point. Independent contractors often live check to check,"" he said. ""We went from having the biggest year ... to zero dollars overnight.""

Gratton said he's eager to get back to work, but believes his team is looking at up to two years before things get back to normal.

""It's not just a matter of doing a show,"" he said. ""How do you park the kids outside? How do you line up? How do I dump my trucks with the band gear into it, into the building when you have a lot of heavy gear? You need to try to stay 6 feet apart. You're wearing masks.""

""I want to hear the drums,"" Gratton continued. ""You know, I want to feel the music. We want to open Justin Bieber's doors and the girls go crazy when 'Baby' comes on ... you can't get that off a computer. There's nothing better than live music, and it's truly the only language we all speak. We need to bring it back, of course, and it shall come back.""

It's a major setback for the industry like it has never experienced before. Patel said she believes this moment in time will be forever remembered as one of the ""great musical moments of the past.""

""The music that comes out during this period will be remembered forever as coronavirus music,"" she said.

For Urban, while he said it felt ""extraordinary"" to be back on stage, he still misses being able to do ""meet and greets"" and shake hands with his fans.

""There's a huge amount of it that I miss,"" he said. ""I miss the physical connectivity with an audience. I don't know when we're going to get to play or mosh pit again. A bunch of car headlights is not the same as a mosh pit, I can tell you that much.

""I derive so much of my energy on stage from that audience right down there and everybody is in this flow. I miss that.""",real

The various iterations of the claim misleadingly refer to two unrelated fires at plants in Illinois and in Nuevo León, Mexico. The factories referenced in the claim do not produce magnesium stearate.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

As of May 15, 2020 multiple iterations of the claim have been shared over 11,439 times on Facebook. Posts are visible here , here , here and here .

One post reads: “TWO separate plants were mysteriously blown up - one in Mexico and one in Illinois. Major supplier of Magnesium Stearate to U.S. blown up in Mexico, at a CHINESE-owned port. Both - just so happen to manufacture Magnesium Stearate- the key component in (SIC) Hydroxychloroquinone and in Zithromax.”

Magnesium stearate is a component in hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax – true

Magnesium stearate is a chemical compound in the form of a fine white powder ( here ) commonly used in medical tablets and capsules, as a lubricant agent that prevents the active ingredients from sticking during manufacture ( here , here ).

It is true it magnesium stearate is found as an inactive ingredient in hydroxychloroquine ( here ) and zithromax (azithromycin) ( here ).

Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug championed by President Donald Trump in April as a potential treatment for COVID-19 ( here ).

Some claims reference a recent fire affecting the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois, that happened on May 7, 2020 ( here , here ).

While the Magnesium Elektron plant does manufacture magnesium products, it does not produce magnesium stearate. According to the company, the main product of the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois is magnesium sheets, not magnesium stearate (see page 22 here ).

“Magnesium Elektron North America (MENA) has three sites that also supply magnesium sheet and coil for commercial, aerospace and defense applications,” states the company in a corporate brochure (see page 13 bit.ly/2WEQ03L )

A company spokesperson confirmed to Reuters via email that the “the factory in Madison, IL does not produce Magnesium Stearate.”

Conclusion

The two fire incidents did happen a day apart, but the plants in these fires do not produce magnesium stearate for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

The claim comes amidst the worldwide search for a COVID-19 treatment and vaccine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, surged after Trump touted it as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus in early April. U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for COVID-19 patients ( here ).

While the drug has not been proven effective against the disease ( here , here ), it is being widely studied in the U.S. and abroad as a potential COVID-19 treatment ( here ).

VERDICT

False. These two unrelated fires did not affect plants that produce magnesium stearate.

SUMMARY: Yes, we'll waste billions and risk lives in a fast search for a coronavirus vaccine — but it's worth it. More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation. College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall. Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside! Biden to announce a ""committee"" to evaluate VP candidates? Come on!

Yes, let's waste billions of dollars — and even risk lives — in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. This is the best and fastest way to find one.

A lab technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at ""Fire Eye"" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei Province. Getty

Insider's Bill Bostock reports that the world's largest vaccine maker is going to manufacture 40 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate this summer, even though the vaccine hasn't been tested yet, might not be safe, or might not work. That's great news.

This is just one of what promise to be many apparently wasteful and risky attempts to create a vaccine — most of which will fail. Other pharma and biotech firms like Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are similarly ramping up vaccine manufacturing, before they know if the shots will work.

Bill Gates has proposed spending billions of dollars to build multiple vaccine-manufacturing plants to scale up production of seven different untested vaccines, though only one is likely to be effective. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is going to spend $2 billion to accelerate production of several vaccine candidates, most of which will likely go to waste.

Others propose to risk human lives to speed up vaccine testing. Some leading scientists want to launch ""human challenge"" trials for coronavirus vaccines. In these trials, volunteers would be given experimental vaccines or a placebo and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.

This would massively accelerate knowledge about whether the vaccine works, because we wouldn't have to wait months to see if the test subjects contract the disease in the normal course of life. But some of the volunteer subjects would also fall ill — especially if it's a placebo trial — and given how terrible COVID-19 is, some would likely die. This is also especially worrying in the current context because we have no effective treatment to help those who do get sick.

Wasting money and potentially harming people obviously aren't good. But, right now, the risks are worth it. That's because our enemy is time.

The normal processes of pharmaceutical research — manufacturing only when you know a drug works, and only testing in the safest ways — make sense in normal situations. But every day we don't have a vaccine, thousands die, billions of dollars in economic activity are lost, and human welfare declines. Our future selves become poorer and sicker.

So there is literally almost nothing we shouldn't try to get us a vaccine quicker, even if that means building factories that make vaccines that don't work and conducting potentially deadly trials on volunteers. —DP

More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation from the '90s

We now have more corroboration of the sexual-assault allegation against then-Sen. Biden in 1993.

Rich McHugh writes in Insider that a neighbor of Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer who recently filed a criminal complaint accusing him of assaulting her in a hallway, has come forward to corroborate her story.

The neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, says Reade told her about the alleged incident in 1995 or 1996, a few years after Reade says it occurred. LaCasse said Reade shared with her many of the same details that Reade has recently alleged.

LaCasse says Reade did not ask her to come forward now. She adds that she is a Democrat and plans to vote for Biden. She says she came forward because she believes it was the right thing to do.

A second corroborator, Lorraine Sanchez, was a colleague of Reade's in a California state senator's office after she left Washington DC. Sanchez says Reade told her that her former boss in Washington had harassed her. Sanchez did not recall whether Reade went into detail.

Biden's campaign has said Reade's allegation is false. Biden himself has not commented on it. He's going to have to.

College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall

The Purdue marching band. Chris T Pehlivan / Shutterstock.com

Crowded parties, football stadiums, dorms, lecture halls … colleges are paradise for a zealous coronavirus, which is why they all shut down, and fast, in March. But most universities and colleges can't afford to stay closed for long. They carry huge faculty and staff costs, and own expensive physical plants.

Colleges also depend on tuition to pay their bills. And most can't simply transition to remote learning, because students won't stand for it. They're paying for the college experience, for working together in labs and studios, living together in dorms.

So it's expected — and encouraging — that we're now seeing a rush of college presidents pushing bold ideas about how to reopen in the fall, even without a coronavirus vaccine or treatment.

In an inspiring letter, president Mitch Daniels said Purdue University is ""determined not to surrender helplessly to those [COVID-19] difficulties but to tackle and manage them aggressively and creatively."" Daniels argues that the virus is not an intolerable risk for the young. He proposes to test everyone in August, reopen campus for those under 35 years old, segregate those older than 35 or at particular risk from the general population, and track and contact trace the infected.

Will it work? Who knows? But it's heartening to see this kind of practical problem-solving from one of the world's greatest engineering schools. We're not going to learn how to live with the virus without some creative, even unorthodox thinking, and it makes sense to use universities — which are the front lines of American research, after all — as laboratories.

For example, Brown University president Christina Paxson acknowledges that reopening colleges will almost certainly require using technology that infringes on civil liberties to vigorously track students and faculty. That seems like an infringement worth a test, and no better place to try it out than in the limited space of a campus.

What Purdue president Daniels doesn't say is that the decision by some schools to reopen will put pressure on other schools, since no college will want to risk losing its students to rivals that have reopened. But not every college will have the resources to test and track in the way Purdue or Brown can, so there will definitely be campus COVID-19 clusters in the fall. —DP

Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside!

As pressure builds for lockdowns to be relaxed or dropped, it's time to get more sophisticated about which measures actually have a big effect on slowing the coronavirus and which don't.

Concentrating our efforts on measures that really matter, while giving us more freedom by relaxing those that don't, will enable us to keep the crucial tactics in place for longer.

So here's a suggestion:

Relax restrictions that encourage or compel people to stay indoors.

The virus spreads primarily by droplets getting from one infected person's nose and mouth to another person's, in sufficient quantities and duration to cause an infection. Sunlight kills the virus quickly, and wind disperses it. Studies suggest that transmission almost exclusively occurs indoors.

As Insider's Anna Medaris Miller explains, experts are confident that being outside is low risk, especially when you are properly distanced. When you're distanced and wearing a mask, in fact, it would take something amounting to a ""freak accident"" for you to catch the virus or infect someone else outside, even if you passed close by each other.

A new study from China underscores this. It looked at 318 ""outbreaks"" that involved three or more cases. Not a single one of these infections occurred outdoors. (Most of them occurred within homes, with one family member infecting others. It has another important implication for more sophisticated distancing measures — namely, creating isolation and quarantine facilities outside of homes — but we'll leave that for another day.)

In a broader look at 7,324 cases, in fact, the researchers found only one case in which infection appears to have occurred outdoors. It involved two people in a village who had a conversation after one of them returned from a visit to Wuhan.

To be clear: It's not impossible to catch or transmit the virus outside. But it's rare. And with minimal precautions — some distancing and a mask — it should be extremely rare.

Meanwhile, going outside has all sorts of psychological and physiological benefits, including allowing us to feel more free and less trapped. As Anna Medaris Miller posits, even experts who fully support distancing measures believe that these benefits offset the risks. Respected Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch — who generally supports strict distancing measures — believes there is a net benefit to keeping open spaces open.

So open the parks!

And go outside! —HB

Everyone's eager to know who VP Biden will choose as his running mate.

Instead of just making the decision and then telling us the answer, however, Biden reportedly plans to first announce the selection of a ""committee"" who will evaluate the candidates.

Yes, the Trump habit of dismissing experts and making impulsive decisions with minimal consideration based on his own ""gut instinct"" leads to imprecision and mistakes. And, yes, the country is suffering for this.

But announcing a committee to evaluate potential VP candidates is going too far the other way.

Of course Biden should have a team evaluate prospective candidates. But he doesn't need to announce in advance who these people are. He also doesn't need to remind Americans that Democrats have a reputation for being overly bureaucratic in their decision-making. —HB",real

1231,1631,https://www.healthnutnews.com/florida-scientist-said-she-was-fired-for-refusing-to-manipulate-covid-19-data/,2020-05-21,FOX: DeSantis: Former Manager of Coronavirus Dashboard “Not a Data Scientist;” Faces Cyber-Stalking Charge,"Rebekah Jones, a geospatial scientist formerly with the state Department of Health, reportedly told several media outlets she was asked to remove data showing that COVID-19 patients first reported symptoms earlier than state officials originally announced. She claimed that when she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen,” she was given the choice to resign or be fired.

Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he did not know Jones, but he insisted her termination was over her “insubordination” — not over any refusal to alter state data.

During a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Mike Pence, DeSantis went further, disputing nearly every claim Jones made in recent interviews.

“One, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,” the governor said. “She was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data. So, she didn’t listen to people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. And so then she was dismissed because of that.”

Then, DeSantis said Jones is under “active criminal charges” in Florida, which includes cyber-stalking and cyber-sexual harassment.

“I have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,” the governor said, adding that he was asking the Department of Health to explain how she had remained employed despite the charges.

Records in the Leon County Clerk of Court website show Rebekah Jones was involved in cases matching what the governor said. In October 2017 and in June 2019, a temporary injunction for stalking was filed against her in Leon County. Those cases are closed.

In July 2019, a stalking case was filed by the state of Florida against Jones. The case remains open.

FOX 13 has reached out to Jones, but we have not heard back.

FOX 13 asked the governor’s office what questionable data Jones was putting online and his spokesperson offered this reply:

“Rebeka [sic] Jones acted as if she had ownership of the Department of Health Dashboard website and disregarded the direction given to her by subject matter experts such as the Senior Epidemiologists, Senior Data Analysts and supervisors. She was resistant to publishing data on the website she disagreed with going against the judgement of the epidemiologists, senior data analysts and supervisors. Event Date is a field that can be queried on the dashboard that marks the beginning of the epidemiological investigation which is based on self-reporting of information that is not medically certified. The science and public health experts believe the best information is the actual clinical diagnosis of the disease verified by COVID-19 diagnostic testing,” Helen Aguirre Ferre wrote.

Meanwhile, some Democratic senators began demanding an investigation into Jones’ claims about data manipulation after her claims got national attention Tuesday.

“We are making public policy decisions based on that information,” state Sen. Lori Berman of Boynton Beach said. “If it is being falsified, we need to know that.”

“Our data is available. Our data is transparent. Any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative,” DeSantis countered Wednesday, pointing to Florida’s comparatively low mortality rate.

“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So they gotta try and find a boogeyman,” he added. “Maybe it’s that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health. If you believe that, I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.”

However, 44% of these cases were diagnosed in the last five days, as many of the new patients were reportedly returning from Colombia.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused his Colombian counterpart, Iván Duque, of intentionally infecting Venezuelans returning home from Colombia with coronavirus, EFE agency reported, citing the official’s comments during a cabinet meeting in Caracas on Wednesday.

“Two weeks ago, I denounced the order given by Ivan Duque. [There was] a very ill-fated meeting that ordered to do everything that could be done to infect Venezuela,” Maduro said as quoted by EFE.

According to the president, 66 cases of coronavirus out of 75 registered on Wednesday, were “imported” from Colombia, as “informal steps” were taken by “organised gangs” to infect the country’s citizens with COVID-19. Maduro, noting that the situation is still under assessment, suggested that Venezuelans could have been infected on the buses used to transfer them to the border area between two countries, as they were allegedly healthy when leaving Bogota and only in contact with their relatives.

“It is hard [...] but it is harder for them to pollute the country, for them to enter and pollute all of Venezuela, as Iván Duque wishes [...] all these things that I say is because I have the evidence in hand,” the president reportedly said.

According to official estimates, 824 cases of coronavirus have been registered in Venezuela since 13 March, when the first cases of infection were reported in the country. Venezuela rushed to immediately declare a national state of emergency and introduce quarantine measures across the country to prevent the spread of the disease.

Venezuelan authorities say that out of all the registered cases, 44% were reported over the last five days. Maduro specified that all of the newly infected people travelling from Colombia, which has registered 17,687 cases so far, will remain at the land border until they are corona-free.",fake

Antigen tests can quickly detect the coronavirus, but are generally considered less accurate than other types of tests that search out the virus.

Antigen tests for COVID-19 are akin to rapid flu or strep tests. This test can be run in a lab or in a doctor’s office, and only takes about 15 minutes.

The tests typically used to diagnose COVID-19, called PCR tests, search out the genetic sequence of the coronavirus in a swab collected from a patient’s nose or throat. Antigen tests, on the other hand, look for molecules on the surface of the virus. They return results much more quickly, but are less accurate. If the test says a patient sample is positive, it’s likely to be correct. But Quidel’s test has a high rate of false negatives: it only correctly identifies patient samples that contains the coronavirus 85 percent of the time, the company’s chief executive told the Wall Street Journal.

The FDA says negative results from an antigen test should be confirmed with a PCR test.

Quidel’s CEO told the WSJ the company is ramping up manufacturing to increase production of the test, officially called the Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA, with a goal of producing 1 million per week.",real

Editor, Health Impact News

People living in the Philippines, a country of islands not very far off the coast of China, remember all too well the last time a deadly coronavirus epidemic broke out in China.

It was 2003 when the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus broke out in China. It infected over 7000 people in China with over 600 recorded deaths.

Even with its close proximity to China and large Chinese population in the Philippine nation of about 80 million people, only 14 cases of SARS was reported with two recorded deaths.

Canada, many thousands of miles away, had far more cases and more deaths recorded due to SARS infection from China than neighboring Philippine Islands.

One of the theories put forward at the time as to why the Filipino people had so few cases, was the country’s predominant use of cooking oil: Coconut Oil.

The Philippines is the world’s largest producer of coconut oil, with about 70% of the world’s coconut oil being exported from the country.

The medium chain fatty acids of coconut oil, and primarily lauric acid, have been known to destroy enveloped viruses by researchers for many years.

Dr. Fabian Dayrit, Ph.D. and Dr. Mary Newport, M.D. have just published a paper regarding coconut oil’s potential to also combat the new coronavirus currently infecting people in China.

The Potential of Coconut Oil and its Derivatives as Effective and Safe Antiviral Agents Against the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV-2019)

by Fabian M. Dayrit, Ph.D. and Mary T. Newport, M.D.

Anteneo De Manila University

Read the research of Professor Emeritus Dr. Fabian Antonio Dayrit (GS’67, HS’71, BS Chemistry ’75) and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody, Inc. on the potential use of coconut oil as a safe antiviral agent against the novel coronavirus.

As we write this, the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency over the novel coronavirus, nCoV-2019, that has spread beyond China. There is still no cure for nCoV-2019. nCoV-2019 has been shown to be related to SARS (Zhou et al., 2020), a coronavirus which caused an outbreak in 2003. Several researchers have been designing drugs to specifically target protease enzymes in coronavirus, but testing for these drugs is many months away. What if there is a treatment candidate against the coronavirus that might already be available and whose safety is already established? Lauric acid (C12) and monolaurin, its derivative, have been known for many years to have significant antiviral activity. Lauric acid is a medium-chain fatty acid which makes up about 50% of coconut oil; monolaurin is a metabolite that is naturally produced by the body’s own enzymes upon ingestion of coconut oil and is also available in pure form as a supplement. Sodium lauryl sulfate, a common surfactant that is made from lauric acid, has been shown to have potent antiviral properties. Lauric acid, monolaurin, and sodium lauryl sulfate (which is also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate) are used in a wide range of products for their antiviral properties. Mechanisms of action Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of lauric acid and monolaurin: first, they cause disintegration of the virus envelope; second, they can inhibit late maturation stage in the virus replicative cycle; and third, they can prevent the binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane. Disintegration of the virus membrane . The antiviral activities of lauric acid and monolaurin were first noted by Sands and co-workers (1979) and later by Hierholzer & Kabara (1982). In particular, Hierholzer & Kabara showed that monolaurin was able to reduce infectivity of 14 human RNA and DNA enveloped viruses in cell culture by >99.9%, and that monolaurin acted by disintegrating the virus envelope. Thormar and co-workers (1987) confirmed the ability of lauric acid and monolaurin to inactivate viruses by disintegration of the cell membrane. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been shown to be able to solubilize and denature the viral envelope (Piret 2000, 2002). Inhibits virus maturation . The Junin virus (JUNV) is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. In a comparison among the saturated fatty acids from C10 to C18 against JUNV infection, Bartolotta and co-workers (2001) showed that lauric acid was the most active inhibitor. From mechanistic studies, it was concluded that lauric acid inhibited a late maturation stage in the replicative cycle of JUNV. From transmission electron microscope images, JUNV is an enveloped virus featuring glycoproteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer forming viral spikes (Grant et al., 2012); this is similar to nCoV-2019. Prevents binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane . Hornung and co-workers (1994) showed that in the presence of lauric acid, the production of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus was inhibited in a dose-dependent and reversible manner: after removal of lauric acid, the antiviral effect disappeared. They observed that lauric acid did not influence viral membrane (M) protein synthesis, but prevented the binding of viral M proteins to the host cell membrane. Although lauric acid accounts for much of the reported antiviral activity of coconut oil, capric acid (C10) and monocaprin have also shown promising activity against other viruses, such as HIV-1 (Kristmundsdóttir et al., 1999). Capric acid accounts for about 7% of coconut oil. Thus, at least two fatty acids in coconut oil, and their monoglycerides, have antiviral properties. Hilarsson and co-workers (2007) tested virucidal activities of fatty acids, monoglycerides and fatty alcohols against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) at different concentrations, times and pH levels. They reported the most active compound tested was monocaprin (C10), which also showed activity against influenza A virus and significant virucidal activities even at a concentration as low as 0.06-0.12%. Use of coconut oil and C12 derivatives in animals and humans Coconut oil and its derivatives have been shown to be safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals. Because of the antiviral and antibacterial protection that it provides to animals, coconut oil, as well as lauric acid and monolaurin, is used in farm animals and pets as veterinary feed supplements in chicken, swine and dogs (Baltic et al., 2017). Monolaurin has been shown to effectively protect chicken against avian influenza virus (van der Sluis, 2015). Li and co- workers (2009) prepared a gel containing monolaurin and found it to be highly active against repeated high viral loads of Simean immunodeficiency virus in macaques and Kirtane and co- workers (2017) developed a 35% gel of monolaurin for application in the female genital tract to protect against HIV. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) has been used at low concentrations to inactivate viruses in milk of farm animals (de Sousa et al., 2019). SLS is the active constituent in commercial disinfecting wipes and standard laboratory disinfectants, and is an emulsifying agent and penetration enhancer in pharmaceutical preparations.",fake

LONDON (Reuters) - Risk managers expect a prolonged global recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, a report by the World Economic Forum showed on Tuesday.

Two-thirds of the 347 respondents to the survey - carried out in response to the outbreak - put a lengthy contraction in the global economy top of their list of concerns for the next 18 months.

Half of risk managers expected bankruptcies and industry consolidation, the failure of industries to recover and high levels of unemployment, particularly among the young.

“The crisis has devastated lives and livelihoods. It has triggered an economic crisis with far-reaching implications and revealed the inadequacies of the past,” said Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the World Economic Forum.

Environmental goals risk being discarded as a result of the pandemic, the report said, but governments should try to carve out a “green recovery”.

“We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive,” Zahidi said.

The report was compiled by the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Advisory Board together with Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc and Zurich Insurance Group.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images

Remember Martin Shkreli? The 37-year-old who infamously became known as “Pharma Bro” and was sentenced in March 2018 to seven years behind bars after he was convicted of securities fraud for lying to investors is back in the news. This time it’s because a judge roundly rejected his request to be released from prison early so that he could work on a cure for the coronavirus. “The court does not find that releasing Mr. Shkreli will protect the public, even though Mr. Shkreli seeks to leverage his experience with pharmaceuticals to help develop a cure for COVID-19 that he would purportedly provide at no cost,” District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto wrote. “In any event, Mr. Shkreli’s self-described altruistic intentions do not provide a legal basis to grant his motion.”

Shkreli had requested to be released from prison for three months to work on a cure for the coronavirus. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman filed a motion calling for the release of Shkreli to home detention at his fiancée’s New York City apartment, saying he would “potentially help others” find a “potential cure” for COVID-19. Shkreli posted a research proposal online in which he characterized the current response to the pandemic as “inadequate” and that his background “as a successful two-time biopharma entrepreneur, having purchased multiple companies, invented multiple new drug candidates” would put him in a good position to aid current efforts. “I have always said that if focused and left in a lab, Martin could help cure cancer,” Brafman said in a statement. “Maybe he can help the scientific community better understand this terrible virus.”

In denying the request, Matsumoto pointed to the way probation officials characterized Shkreli’s claim that he could help to find a COVID-19 cure just the type of “delusional self-aggrandizing behavior” that contributed to his conviction. “Shkreli has no formal scientific training and no experience working [in] a laboratory setting, and he does not explain why he cannot continue to develop and discuss any ideas he may have about COVID-19 from prison, as he has,” prosecutors wrote to the judge. And even if he were to somehow find a cure, there’s no evidence to suggest he would not use it “to enrich himself to the maximum extent possible, including by concealing his work or declining to provide such a cure to others unless he were paid an exorbitant sum.”

The judge also rejected the idea that Shkreli’s childhood asthma somehow puts him at particular risk for catching the coronavirus in the low-security Pennsylvania prison where he is being detained that has not reported any cases. “Not surprised but very disappointed,” Brafman, said of the decision. “Notorious defendant never catches a break even when well deserved and in the best interest of the country.”",real

Public health authorities can customize the system and combine it with data that users input voluntarily, the companies said.

States including North Dakota and Alabama have already requested and received access to the tech tools, as have 22 countries outside the U.S., according to Apple and Google. Countries including Germany, Italy and Ireland — all of which will base their national apps on the companies’ technology — are expected to release their apps in the coming weeks.

Health experts say contact tracing is essential to slowing the illness' spread and allowing the economy to reopen safely, and U.S. states are pouring millions of dollars into hiring people to go about it in low-tech teams. The phone-based apps aim to supercharge the effort, but doubts are already emerging about the effectiveness of the Google-Apple initiative, in part because the companies are imposing privacy restrictions on the types of information that health agencies can collect.

For instance, the apps will be able to tell when a smartphone user has been near a person who has tested positive for the coronavirus — but won't track the locations where the infected person has been. In contrast, states such as North Dakota have deployed apps that use GPS location tracking, which they say could help identify geographic hotspots in sparsely populated areas.

On the other hand, some privacy restrictions may be necessary to win over a public skittish after years of complaints about Silicon Valley's use of people’s personal data. A recent Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that nearly 60 percent of Americans could or would not use apps designed using Apple's and Google's technology. About 82 percent of Americans have smartphones, pollsters found.

“Either you have a system unlikely to help people navigate their world, to leave their house and feel safe, or you have privacy trade-offs,"" said University of Washington Law School professor Ryan Calo.

Meanwhile, some states like California already plan to use the technology, and North Dakota has said it will build a second app that complies with the companies' rules.

A similar debate has played out in Europe, where the big tech companies clashed with, and ultimately prevailed over, government leaders who were pursuing their own versions of contract tracing apps before largely conceding to the approach being pushed by Apple and Google.

The two companies have said that authorized public health agencies' contact-tracing apps can have access to the Apple-Google technology as long as they agree to the privacy restrictions. Apple and Google have also suggested that countries should deploy just one app each to increase user adoption, but the companies added they will work with state and regional governments as well.

The two companies have a lot of leverage because, together, they control the underlying software used on almost all smartphones. That means apps that work Apple's and Google's technology would have a greater chance of seeing widespread adoption — a critical factor in whether any phone-based tracing effort succeeds.

The software they have developed taps into a smartphone’s Bluetooth signals and records when two devices come into close proximity. If any of the people later test positive for coronavirus, they can choose to anonymously notify others whom they may have exposed to the illness in the past two weeks.

The technology has also been developed to allow Android and iPhone devices to communicate with one another and to do so without devouring the smartphone's battery life, factors also seen as critical to the apps working as public health officials hope.

Apple and Google have stood firm on not allowing apps that use their software to collect location data, and the technology is designed so that neither company will have access to patients’ identities or sensitive health information. Information about who has come into contact with a specific person will be stored only in the person's phone, not in a central database. And people will have to consent both to using the apps and to sharing their coronavirus diagnoses.

Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced privacy legislation to prevent app-makers from misusing patient data.

Senate Republicans led by Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi were first to introduce a bill earlier this month that would impose new rules on companies collecting data for coronavirus tracking. Democrats countered with a bill of their own last week that they say would go even further to protect personal information.",real
1271,706,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/05/08/virginia-reopen-coronavirus-faq/,2020-05-08,"What is open in Virginia, and how did officials decide?","State officials have watched for signs that the spread of the novel coronavirus is slowing before allowing Virginia to enter Phase 1 of its reopening plan.

Those decisions depend on a few key metrics: namely, downward trajectories in the rate of infection and number of people who are sick, plus indications the state has sufficient testing, protective equipment and monitoring in place to deal with a potential surge.





Here is what is open in some parts of the state — and the latest on the benchmarks state and local officials are using to decide whether reopening is safe.

New daily deaths per 100,000 residents

Is everything open?

Far from it. Even in southern and western Virginia, where most counties and cities have entered Phase 1, movie theaters, indoor gyms and restaurant dining rooms remain closed. Only restaurants already authorized for outdoor dining can offer sit-down service — outside, at half capacity, with patrons at least six feet apart and any game areas or playground facilities closed.

Virginia’s limit on gatherings of more than 10 people stays in place until June 10 but is waived to allow nonessential retailers to reopen at half of their lowest licensed capacity. All customers must be kept at least six feet apart. No fitting rooms. Face masks are required for employees and strongly encouraged for customers.

Outdoor exercise classes are allowed, with equipment disinfected and participants at least 10 feet apart. Outdoor pools can reopen for lap swimming, with one person per lane. Hair and nail salons can reopen by appointment and with strict limitations. Providers and customers will be required to wear masks, so no beard trimming or lip waxing.





In Virginia Beach on Friday, the beaches will be open to swimming and sunbathing. No group sports, alcohol, tents or large groups will be allowed, and parking areas will be limited to 50-percent capacity.

What about Northern Virginia?

The elected leaders in the region’s five largest jurisdictions — Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun and Arlington counties, plus the city of Alexandria — asked Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to keep them shut down a while longer, and he agreed.

The region, which contains a third of Virginia’s population, has averaged nearly double the number of daily coronavirus-related deaths in recent days than the rest of the state, a Washington Post analysis of government data found.



Though his executive order on a gradual reopening carries a May 28 deadline for Northern Virginia, Northam said he would allow the state’s economic engine to resist reopening for “as long as it takes.”

“This is about safety,” he said.

How many people are hospitalized?

In Virginia, 1,502 people with confirmed or probable cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were hospitalized Monday, after 47 more were admitted since Sunday. On Monday, the rolling average of daily hospital admissions over five days was 60, compared with 82 the previous Monday. There were 361 covid-19 patients in intensive care units Monday, down from 396 in the past week.

What about hospital beds?

Virginia officials have said there are enough hospital beds to handle admissions through mid-June, with 4,389 still available Monday, according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association.





On Monday, 629 ventilators were being used, 21 percent of the state’s supply.

Does the state have enough personal protective equipment?

Last month, Virginia officials said the state had ordered 17.4 million respirator masks, 1 million face shields and 17 million pairs of gloves. No hospital in Virginia has reported difficulty in acquiring enough protective gear within a 72-hour period since May 8, down from a high of seven hospitals in mid-April, according to the state health department.

[The latest on reopening plans in the region: D.C. | Maryland]

What about coronavirus testing and the rate of infections?

The state initially prioritized testing for specific groups, such as those older than 65, first responders and people already showing flu-like symptoms. Facing criticism over Virginia’s low rate of testing, state officials began taking samples from residents in low-income areas and plan to test people with chronic diseases, expectant mothers, babies born to mothers with covid-19, and uninsured and underinsured residents, said Karen Remley, a former Virginia health commissioner who is helping the state with testing.





The average number of tests conducted increased from about 2,600 a day to more than 7,000 per day about a week ago before dropping to just over 5,800 on Monday. The state hopes to get to 10,000 tests per day.

As of Monday, 194,677 coronavirus tests had been conducted.

Northam’s office says the governor wants to see sustained declines in the rate of people testing positive. Last week, the state health department eliminated results from less-reliable antibody tests from that calculation, which had pushed the positivity rate slightly downward. The seven-day average of positive test results for Monday was 14.9 percent, up slightly from the past week’s 14 percent but still lower than a high of 22 percent in mid-April.

What about contact tracing?

The National Association of City and County Health Officials estimates states need about 15 to 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents, the governor’s office says.

The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the virus COVID-19, which references the type of virus and the year it emerged. The WHO declared that the virus is a pandemic.

The Verge is regularly updating this page with all the latest news and analysis.

You can see where and how many cases of the illness have been reported in this map. The majority of the illnesses were initially in China, where the virus first emerged, but the rate of new cases there has nearly stopped. There are now many times more cases outside of China than there were inside of it at the height of the outbreak. There are large outbreaks of the disease in multiple places, including Spain, Italy, and the United States, which currently has the worst outbreak of any country in the world.

As this important story continues to unfold, our hope is to answer all of your questions as people work to understand this virus and contain its spread.

Table of contents

Where did the virus come from?

At the end of December, public health officials from China informed the World Health Organization that they had a problem: an unknown, new virus was causing pneumonia-like illness in the city of Wuhan. They quickly determined that it was a coronavirus and that it was rapidly spreading through and outside of Wuhan.

Coronaviruses are common in animals of all kinds, and they sometimes can evolve into forms that can infect humans. Since the start of the century, two other coronaviruses have jumped to humans, causing the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the MERS outbreak in 2012.

Scientists think this new virus first became capable of jumping to humans at the beginning of December. It originally seemed like the virus first infected people at a seafood market in Wuhan and spread from there. But one analysis of early cases of the illness, published on January 24th, found that the first patient to get sick did not have any contact with the market. Experts are still trying to trace the outbreak back to its source.

The type of animal the virus originated from is not clear, although one analysis found that the genetic sequence of the new virus is 96 percent identical to one coronavirus found in bats. Both SARS and MERS originated in bats.

Where is it spreading?

The virus is now spreading all over the world.

Although it originated in China, the country took aggressive action at the start of the outbreak, shutting down transportation in some cities and suspending public gatherings. Officials isolated sick people and aggressively tracked their contacts, and had a dedicated network of hospitals to test for the virus.

Now, the epicenter of the pandemic is in the US, which has more cases than any country in the world. New York City has the highest number of cases in the country. Previous US hot spots included a nursing home in Washington; New Rochelle, New York; and the Boston area, where the disease spread at a conference.

There are over 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US.

How dangerous is this new virus?

It takes information about both how severe an illness is and how easily it can spread to determine how “bad” it can be. Epidemiologists often use this tool to assess new strains of the flu, for example:

If an illness isn’t very severe (and kills only a small percentage of people), but it’s highly transmissible, it can still be devastating. An easily transmitted illness that kills a small percentage of the people it infects can still cause a lot of deaths, precisely because so many people get sick.

The WHO named the illness caused by the coronavirus COVID-19 — “co” and “vi” for coronavirus, “d” for disease, and “19” for the year when the disease emerged.

COVID-19 is a serious illness, and it’s much more dangerous than the flu. One Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projection suggests that between 160 to 214 million people will be infected in the US, and that between 200,000 and 1.7 million could die. That doesn’t take into account actions taken to slow down the outbreak, though.

The symptoms of COVID-19 have ranged from mild, like those in a cold, to severe. Around 80 percent of confirmed cases are mild and don’t require hospitalization — at least, 80 percent of the cases that we know about. It’s still possible that there are more mild cases of the illness that haven’t been flagged, which would shrink the percentage of cases that are severe. In about 15 percent of people, the illness is severe enough that they need to be hospitalized, and about 5 percent of cases are critical. It appears around half of the people with critical cases of the illness die from it.

So far, experts say that around 1 percent of people who get sick with COVID-19 will die, though it’s too early to say for sure how often it is fatal. Those numbers may change as the outbreak progresses, and will be different in different places, depending on the demographics of the population. By comparison, 14 to 15 percent of people who got sick from SARS died.

Different groups of people, though, are more at risk of having a severe case of the illness or of dying from it. Most deaths in this outbreak have been in older people and those who have underlying health issues, like heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. In that group, people are more at risk of dying. Around 14 percent of people over the age of 80 who get sick will die, for example.

How easily can the virus spread?

The virus moves rapidly. The new coronavirus spreads quickly in contained environments, like on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

Early evidence suggested that, like other coronaviruses, the virus jumps between people who are in very close contact with each other. It also probably spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Coughs and sneezes produce little droplets of mucus and saliva. If these droplets make it into another person’s eyes, mouth, or nose, they can get sick. The viruses in those little droplets can also fall onto surfaces, like tables or doorknobs — if someone touches that surface and touches their eyes, mouth, or nose, they can also get sick.

Early research shows that the virus can linger on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for a few days, which is why it’s important to clean countertops, doorknobs, and other places people touch regularly. The virus doesn’t appear to stay infectious on cardboard for longer than a day, so packages should be fairly safe.

Scientists are still trying to figure out how long tiny droplets containing virus could linger in the air if a sick person coughs or sneezes, or when they breathe or talk. They know that certain procedures done in the hospital can spray the virus into the air, where it can linger for a few hours, which is why it’s so important for doctors and nurses doing those procedures to have masks that can filter it out. But it’s still not clear how much the virus stays in the air normally without those artificial interventions.

We also don’t know when people with COVID-19 become contagious or how long being contagious lasts. One study of nine people in Germany with mild cases of the illness found that they had high levels of the virus in their throats early on in the course of the disease, before they felt very sick. Research out of China showed that people without symptoms still have high levels of the virus in their throats and noses, so they may be passing it along if they cough or sneeze.

The WHO says that people appear to be able to spread the virus for up to three days before they start showing symptoms, and preliminary research suggests that people without symptoms or mild, almost unnoticeable symptoms may be driving the epidemic. At a nursing home in Washington state, 13 of 23 people who tested positive for the virus at one point did not yet have symptoms.

Each sick person will go on to infect, on average, between 1.4 and 2.5 additional people, the WHO says, though that’s an early estimate. Other teams of researchers have published their own estimates, with most saying a sick person will infect an average of around two or three people.

Those numbers are called the virus’s R0 (pronounced “R-naught”). The R0 is the mathematical representation of how well an infection might be able to spread. The higher the number, the easier the disease is to spread. For comparison, the R0 for SARS was between two and five. But that doesn’t mean each sick person will actually infect that many people; quarantines and other actions taken to control outbreaks of a virus can bring down the number of people a sick person infects.

Can we treat this virus?

There aren’t any proven treatments for COVID-19, but there are dozens of studies underway to find some. One leading candidate is remdesivir, an antiviral medication originally developed to treat Ebola. There are clinical trials testing it in patients in China, in the US, and around the world. While there’s a lot of hype around the anti-malaria medication chloroquine, there’s still no evidence it — or any other drug — actually works.

Research teams and pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection. However, vaccine development takes a long time. Even if everything goes smoothly, it will be around a year to 18 months before one is available, said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

What can I do to protect myself and others?

Stay home as much as possible, especially if you’re feeling sick. Stay home even if you’re not feeling sick — evidence suggests people can be contagious even if they don’t have symptoms. Wash your hands, wipe down surfaces with disinfectant, and cover your mouth if you cough.

You can also wear cloth masks or face coverings when you’re out in public, especially in places where it’s hard to stay far away from others. Don’t go out and buy medical-grade masks because doctors and nurses need those. But wearing a cloth face covering could help stop you virus-laden particles to other people, even if you don’t know you’re sick.

If you’re a young, healthy person, you might not feel very sick if you catch COVID-19. But if you don’t stay home and away from others, you could pass it on to someone older or with a chronic health condition who is more likely to have a severe case of the disease.

One of the best ways to slow the spread of an outbreak is by staying away from other people, which is also called “social distancing.” That gives a virus less opportunity to jump from person to person. It’s why everyone is being asked to stay home. Those measures help blunt the impact of an outbreak by slowing the virus. If fewer people get sick at once, it’s easier for health care providers to give everyone good care.

If I already had COVID-19, am I immune?

Many researchers think that after someone is infected with the coronavirus, there’s a good chance that person won’t get sick from the virus again for some still-undetermined amount of time. That’s based on what scientists know about how most viruses work. Usually, when you’re sick from a viral infection, your body develops antibodies against that virus. The next time you’re exposed to the virus, those antibodies could stop it from turning into a raging illness — though that isn’t always the case.

There isn’t concrete evidence that people who got sick once with COVID-19 can’t get sick again because no studies have specifically tested that idea. But virologists don’t think that this virus behaves differently than most other viruses — so people who did get sick are probably protected. The question, though, is for how long: for some viruses, the protection fades after a year or a few years. There aren’t answers to that question yet.

Some doctors in China and South Korea have reported that some patients who were sick with COVID-19 and recovered tested positive for the virus a second time. That probably doesn’t mean they were re-infected, though, and doesn’t mean that people can get sick more than once in a short period of time. Instead, it probably means that there were still tiny bits of virus lingering in their nose and throat — not enough to make them sick, and probably not enough to make other people sick, but enough to trigger a positive test. It could also mean that the patients’ initial, negative tests after they felt better were false negatives, which happen frequently.

What’s happening in the US?

US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in response to the coronavirus at the end of January, and President Trump declared a federal emergency in March.

The virus is spreading through the country, and dozens of states and counties have made emergency declarations. Hotspots include Louisiana and New York. It may have been spreading in Washington and other states for weeks before it was first detected.

As the case counts shoot up, governors and local officials have closed nonessential businesses and told people to work from home and stay away from others. Hospitals in New York City and other places are buckling under the strain of hundreds of critically ill people; they’re running short on protective equipment for nurses and ventilators to help patients breathe. The interventions are helping to slow the spread of the disease in some areas.

The virus spread undetected because CDC guidelines originally did not allow testing unless a sick person had been in a country with an ongoing spread of the virus or who had been in contact with someone with a confirmed case of the disease could be tested. That delayed the diagnosis of patients who did not have those risk factors. They’ve since updated the guidance to say that doctors can use their best judgment to decide if the patient should be tested.

Public health experts are struggling to slow the spread of disease in part because there are still a limited number of tests available. It took too long for the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC to develop and distribute a functioning test, and longer still for testing capacity to increase. In addition, public health agencies across the country don’t have the resources to get in touch with everyone who tests positive and find the people they may have exposed — a critical public health tool called contact tracing.

Experts say that the US needs to dramatically increase the number of tests done each week and scale up the contact tracing workforce in order to control the outbreak.

REUTERS/Kham

HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.

Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.

Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.

Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.

The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.

“Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.

It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement.",real

This article is part of the Free Speech Project , a collaboration between Future Tense and the Tech, Law, & Security Program at American University Washington College of Law that examines the ways technology is influencing how we think about speech.

As the pandemic has accelerated, so too has oppression of free speech throughout the world. That worries Steve Coll, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University and a staff writer at the New Yorker. (He was also among the founding fathers of Future Tense; it launched when he was president of New America, a partner with Slate and Arizona State University in Future Tense.) “We can’t afford to lose journalism as a court of last resort,” he said during Thursday’s Future Tense web event, “Free Speech Project: Symptoms May Include Censorship,” which examined the pandemic’s impact on free speech around the world. In a conversation with Andrés Martinez, editorial director of Future Tense, Coll discussed what we stand to lose if censorship becomes another casualty of COVID-19.

When governments fail, journalism can succeed. Coll said that without the Indianapolis Star’s investigative work, Larry Nassar, the former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics physician accused of sexually abusing hundreds of young women, may have not been brought to justice. Now smaller media organizations are folding, larger ones are laying off staff, tech companies are taking a larger role in moderating speech, and governments are quelling dissent and expanding surveillance in the name of the crisis. Together, those trends threaten free speech when we need it most.

Although threats against it are as old as free speech itself, Coll said there has been a global shift toward authoritarianism in the 21st century. He described this as a moment when governments aren’t even trying to pretend to value free speech anymore: “Regimes like Turkey and Egypt are jailing more journalists than ever,” and attacks on the credibility of independent journalism are on the rise.

Building on this sentiment, Martinez said that global threats against free speech are a “parallel epidemic.” As the entire world responds to the coronavirus pandemic, regimes are getting away with rationalizations of national security that would have been challenged in the past, said Coll. “President Trump’s embrace of populism is a strategy that is echoing throughout the world,” he said, citing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s efforts to kill press freedom as an example of the impact of the United States surrendering leadership of global human rights promotion.

Speech isn’t dying out everywhere, though: “[E]ven as there’s a closing of government protections of speech across the world, there’s a huge structural opening of speech online,” said Coll. The advent of online speech has offered new platforms for expression; Coll pointed out that while dissenters in Egypt may have been taken off the radio, dissidents like Mohamed Ali, now exiled in Spain, can write and share things that would have resulted in his immediate arrest in his home country.

While online speech was once heralded as a boon to free speech and democracy, it has also created a pathway for viral misinformation. Martinez said that “10 years ago that structural opening was the cause of great optimism … but in more recent years we’ve been concerned about how these platforms can be weaponized.” Now, legitimate concern about misinformation is being weaponized during the pandemic. As an example, Martinez pointed to countries like Vietnam using COVID-19 as an excuse for silencing dissent.

Martinez asked Coll, a former managing editor of the Washington Post, whether tech platforms should impose editorial judgment on online speech—whether, for instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s role at Facebook may come to resemble the Sulzberger family helming the New York Times.

Facebook is attempting to preempt regulation by engineering its own system of content moderation and even establishing a free speech oversight panel, but Coll said we should be cautious about giving platforms authority to decide what constitutes permissible speech: “It’s always the case that policies that are adopted to silence outside voices silence a lot of other voices.”

Despite the alarming trends, Coll has hope for the future of journalism. “What we think of journalism today at [Columbia’s School of Journalism] is lashed to the scientific method, has a public function, and seeks to justify its protection in the Constitution,” he said.

JP Morgan study finds COVID-19 infection rates have declined — not increased — in states that have reopened

This will not make doomsday fearmongers happy.

The Blaze, May 21, 2020:

A report by JPMorgan finds that COVID-19 infection rates have declined, not increased, in states that have reopened. The eye-opening study from the investment banking institution was shared by CNBC financial anchor Carl Quintanilla in a series of tweets.

Research by JPMorgan shows that the coronavirus infection rates of states that have ended their lockdowns have declined, “even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag.” The incubation period for coronavirus has a median time of four to five days, and as long as 14 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“JPMorgan has a devastating piece arguing that infection rates have declined — not increased — in states where lockdowns have ended, ‘even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag,'” Quintanilla wrote of the report by Marko Kolanovic, the Global Head of Macro Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy team at JPMorgan.

“Same goes for various countries, adds JPM. ‘This means that the pandemic and COVID-19 likely have its own dynamics unrelated to often inconsistent lockdown measures that were being implemented,'” Quintanilla tweeted.

“In the absence of conclusive data, these lockdowns were justified initially,” the JPMorgan report states, according to Quintanilla. “Millions of lives were being destroyed … with little consideration that [lockdowns] might not only cause economic devastation but potentially more deaths than COVID-19 itself.”

The report also warns: “Demagogues will be tempted to use COVID-19 to blame immigrants, people of a different race, or use the pandemic as a pretext to intensify geopolitical tensions. We will closely monitor how these risks evolve, but at this point see them as potential tail risks.

“The initial response of the administration was to downplay the risk of the COVID-19 epidemic,” the report adds. “However, since then, this simplistic thesis changed significantly. The administration shifted to forecasting a larger negative impact (setting the stage for them to ‘outperform.'”

The report continues by saying that the administration was “shifting the pandemic blame to China and the WHO, and .. shifting the blame for economic pain to large blue states that are perceived to be slowing down the re-opening of the economy.”

“Indeed, allowed economic activity across the country is now largely following partisan lines,” the JPMorgan report states.

Quintanilla points out that Kolanovic “came close to calling the peak in US cases back on April 6.”

Kolanovic retweeted an article on Wednesday that referred to a study titled, “Full lockdown policies in Western Europe countries have no evident impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic.” The study claims to have found “no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends” when comparing data from before and after lockdowns in Italy, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

“Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western Europe,” the study read. “We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the epidemic.”

The article adds a quote from Kolanovic that said:

While our knowledge of the virus and lack of effectiveness of total lockdowns evolved, lockdowns remained in place and focus shifted to contact tracing, contemplating second wave outbreaks, and ideas about designing better educational, political and economic systems. At the same time, millions of livelihoods were being destroyed by these lockdowns. Unlike rigorous testing of potential new drugs, lockdowns were administered with little consideration that they might not only cause economic devastation but potentially more deaths than COVID-19 itself.

Another person who is skeptical of COVID-19 lockdowns is Dr. Knut Wittkowski, the former head of biostatistics, epidemiology, and research design at Rockefeller University.

“With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity. About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected,” Wittkowski said in a now-deleted YouTube video.

YouTube removed Wittkowski’s anti-lockdown video that had over 1.3 million views before being deleted.

“They don’t tell you. They just say it violates our community standards. There’s no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated,” Wittkowski said of his coronavirus video being removed.",fake

Akron Beacon Journal

JC Tretter isn’t willing to publicly quantify his level of optimism that an NFL season will be held in 2020.

The starting center of the Browns and new president of the NFL Players Association said the COVID-19 pandemic has created too many unknowns to speculate about what football will look like as the year unfolds.

“This is a contact disease, and we play a contact sport,” Tretter said Tuesday during a Zoom video conference with Browns beat writers.

“You can’t expect just to throw football back in and think that the virus is going to kneel down to almighty football. You have to look through different ways of making sure people stay healthy.”

Some NFL teams began reopening their facilities Tuesday, but players and coaches still aren’t permitted at club headquarters, all of which had been shut down since late March.

Meanwhile, Browns staffers continue to work remotely while the organization works through finalizing its reopening plans.

The NFL’s voluntary virtual offseason program is scheduled to run through May 29, but the league has already extended it once and could do so again.

The Browns are slated to begin training camp in late July, kick off the preseason August 15 and start the regular season Sept. 13.

In a memo NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent to the 32 teams last week, he wrote the league is working with the NFLPA “on developing protocols that could permit a certain number of players to return to club facilities as early as next month.”

However, Tretter explained “there’s a long list of hurdles” that need to be cleared before players will be comfortable returning to work in the traditional sense, let alone playing in games.

“There’s a level of risk of everything,” Tretter said. “You’re facing a level of risk right now going to the grocery store. There’s always going to be a level of exposure that people are going to face in this. So I don’t think we’ll ever get to a point where there’s no risk of exposure.

“Coming in contact with other people is a risk of exposure. So that’s never going to be down to zero. Our job [at the NFLPA] is to try to get that to as close to zero as possible, and that’s why you kind of have to look at everything.”

Tretter said “obviously testing is going to have to be real important” for the league to charge ahead with a season. But Tretter also repeatedly stressed the importance of being open to new ideas.

NFLPA medical director Thom Mayer told ESPN’s Adam Schefter this week on Schefter’s podcast that the league is partnering with Oakley to explore the possibility of designing face masks with surgical or N95 material.

“I think there’s no bad idea at this point, and you kind of have to think outside the box,” Tretter said when asked about the innovative face mask concept. “And just ’cause it’s an idea doesn’t mean things are definitely going to happen, but you need to explore it, and you need to understand it.”

Tretter, who earned a degree in industrial and labor relations from Cornell University, said he decided to run for NFLPA president right after this past season ended. He was elected in March shortly before the players approved a new collective bargaining agreement in a close vote.

Since the global health crisis has changed everyday life, Tretter has been involved with biweekly conference calls the union has held for players and their wives to address COVID-19 concerns.

“Our priority is always going to be the health and safety of the players, and usually when you say that, you mean things that happen on the field,” Tretter said. “Obviously, it kind of takes a new meaning with everything going on now.

“The emphasis is always on the elderly population and the effects of the virus, but there are a lot of people with underlying conditions inside our league. People see professional athletes as kind of these invincible robots where they’re just kind of always in the best shape and there’s no chink in the armor, but that’s not really the case.”

Tretter said he thinks the league and NFLPA reaching an agreement about returning to the field is “still a ways out.” But he also pointed out the two sides have time on their side.

Meanwhile, he’s not putting “a percentage” or “a level” on how likely playing football in the fall will be.

“There’s really no reason to live in a lot of different hypotheticals, or else I feel like you kind of get paralyzed in those hypotheticals, keep going down different rabbit holes and you kind of just lose track of the now,” Tretter said. “So I’ve been trying to live in two-week increments.”",real

They were staying in Gurgaon, on the outskirts of Delhi. Jyoti’s mother and elder sister and family had managed to return to their village in Darbhanga in Bihar ahead of the lockdown.

An Indian girl's feat of pedalling over 1,200 kilometres with an injured father has caught the attention of the Cycling Federation of India, which has now offered to take her on for training to be a professional cyclist.

“When we came to know that she has pedalled, that too with her father and some luggage, to cover 1,200 kilometres in seven days, we felt it was something extraordinary. It showed her endurance. So we thought, if she has such stamina, why don’t we give her a chance"", Onkar Singh, Chairman of the Cycling Federation of India told Sputnik.

“We have talked to her and explained our process. She said she is under quarantine now, but wants to follow her studies. We told her that our system of training is inclusive of academic studies and trains them in competitive cycling as well"", he said.

Onkar Singh said the Cycling Federation scouts for talent across the country between the ages 14-17, takes care of their training, education, boarding, and lodging and once they are ready to hit the track, nominate them for competitions at the national and international level.

Jyoti bought a used bicycle for a little over $25 and decided to carry her father on it all the way to her village 1,200 kilometres away, after their landlord asked them to vacate their home since they were unable to pay the rent. It took eight days for the young teenager to pedal all the way to Darbhanga from Gurgaon.

Jyoti's father, an electric rickshaw driver had experienced an accident before the lockdown and was confined to his home. The father and daughter managed to survive for two months, but once the landlord asked them to vacate the premises, there was no other option for the duo.

Social media, meanwhile, has been all praise for the girl for her grit and determination. US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka tweeted, “This beautiful feat of endurance and love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!""

15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days.

​India has been under a prolonged lockdown since 25 March to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown has deprived hundreds of thousands of daily wage earners of their livelihood, and many trudged back to their villages.

Since COVID-19 hit India on 30 January, the caseload has spiralled to cross the 100,000 mark. As of Saturday, the cumulative number of cases has reached 125,101, including 51,784 recoveries and 3,720 deaths.",fake

Some suburban districts have already started inviting families back through an appointment-based system, while Chicago Public Schools is working on a plan to let students pick up their personal belongings left at schools in March when it was still unclear how long buildings would be shut.

State Supt. of Education Carmen Ayala said schools are welcome to start allowing students to come by and pick up their possessions as long as proper social distancing is maintained.

“It has to be very well orchestrated for each school,” Ayala said in a Facebook live interview with State Rep. Emanuel Chris Welch.

“We really don’t want the social gatherings and the, ‘Goodbye, it’s the end of the school year,’ for obvious reasons,” she added. “But yes, absolutely, that is allowed. And I do know that schools are beginning to message that and plan and have those things occur.”

Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Emily Bolton said the district is developing soon-to-be-released guidance on how the clean-outs will take place.

Whitney Young Magnet High School, for one, told families last week that students would be assigned a date and time starting this upcoming Monday through May 22 to retrieve their belongings, and social distancing protocols would be followed.

Many other CPS teachers and families were still waiting to hear how their schools will handle the issue.

Meanwhile in west suburban Plainfield, elementary school parents are required to make an appointment to pick up their student’s belongings, while middle school families will receive a bag that also includes a yearbook. High schoolers who aren’t graduating will be able to keep their possessions in their lockers until next school year or pick them up by appointment.

Staff at the three high schools at Maine Township District 207 in the northwest suburbs — Maine East, Maine South and Maine West — have been collecting items from locker rooms and putting them in bags or boxes tagged with each student’s name. Kids are then assigned a date and time to come by the school for pickup and to turn in textbooks, musical instruments, library books and other items.

“The response to COVID-19 has occurred in stages,” said Maine West Principal Eileen McMahon. “The materials pick-up is one of the final stages and it is bittersweet.”",real

A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)

H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.

H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”

The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.

In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.

Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.

What is Contract Tracing?

Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.

Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:

The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.

If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.

So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

“By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?

“So, I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor,” Trump said.

'This will kill you': People are warning others following Trump's apparent use of hydroxychloroquine

The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.

At a Senate hearing last week, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said U.S. testing for coronavirus is “nothing to celebrate” because the country “treaded water” during the early stages of the pandemic while other countries such as South Korea tested people aggressively to curb the outbreak.

Romney said by March 6, the U.S. had conducted only 2,000 tests while South Korea had completed 140,000. Romney He said more aggressive testing was part of the reason why South Korea has had more success in fighting the virus.

South Korea has had 263 COVID-19 deaths, while the U.S. surpassed 92,000 Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

It took the U.S. until mid-April to pass South Korea in testing, which confirmed its first COVID-19 case on the same day, and until April 25 to surpass Finland.

'Unrivaled?' Fact-checking Donald Trump's claims about COVID-19 testing

Trump is correct when he says the U.S. has the most completed tests by any nation. However, that represents a single test for approximately 3.7% of the population.

The U.S. still trails many nations in per capita testing, including the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany.

Despite ramping up national testing in the U.S., health experts have raised concerns that not enough are being done for state's to safely reopen.

Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told a congressional panel monitoring the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic last week that, ""The U.S. needs more than 900,000 tests every day to safely open up again. We are doing about a third of that.""

A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Jaclyn Regan of Staten Island, New York is one such bride: Her New Jersey wedding was canceled six days before it was supposed to happen in March.

The cancellation has been emotionally and financially difficult for Regan and her fiancé, Angelo Fallacaro: They lost around $3,000 and are left with now useless, date-specific decor, from champagne flutes to personalized T-shirts.

The couple has rescheduled their big day — and Regan says that compared to how others are suffering right now, they know their problems are small.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

On March 14, one week before our wedding, a manager from the catering hall where we were about to be married called and asked how we felt about postponing.

At the time, the threat of the coronavirus was still very new, so while the outbreak was on my mind, it really hadn't been a major concern. We live in Staten Island, where at the time only one case had been confirmed. It was still too early to grasp just how devastating this virus was going to be.

So we sat down with our families, talked over our options, and scheduled a meeting at our venue — South Gate Manor in Freehold, New Jersey — for the next day.

The news wasn't great. The owner of the catering hall had already started to cancel upcoming events. Some of our wedding guests started calling to say they wouldn't be able to make it. Of course I was devastated — everything was set and ready to go, we were so close — but there was a strong possibility that Freehold Township would close down entirely, food deliveries would be delayed, and guests wouldn't be able to get to the hall.

The day was already ruined, six days before it was to happen. We realized it was only logical to postpone.

Reorganizing our wedding has been a bump in the road, a big one, but we're making the best of it. This virus is deadly and scary. So many people are sick and so many people have lost their jobs — I had to throw out a couple of dated items and replace a seating chart. I try to keep it in that perspective. This is obviously not how we planned things, but compared to how others are suffering, it's simply an inconvenience.

In terms of loss, we were actually in a good position. Because we were one of the first weddings to be cancelled, we had our first choice of dates to reschedule. We wanted to recoup as much as possible, so we opted for the next available Friday, which is July 17. South Gate is a big family business — the caterer's sister is his florist, his brother is a photographer — so that made the transition easier. There were just a lot of phone calls and a little bit of juggling to make sure all of the vendors could transfer their services to that date.

The limos, the DJ, and basically everyone else involved were able to make the switch. Our officiant was the only missing piece — we'll have to make a change there — but overall there wasn't major damage.

Some of our flowers were already in transit, so the florist had to accept at least half upon delivery. We had 300 blush roses in our house for days; I was giving them away to friends, neighbors, anyone who would take them.

That portion of the flowers ($1,500) and the officiant fee ($500) were a complete loss. I put off estimating our overall losses for a month, basically thinking ""it is what it is,"" but after adding it all up, it's not nearly as bad as I had imagined. We're losing about $3,000, which is nothing compared to the total cost of the wedding which is around $65,000.

But there's so much that I can't put a price on.

Our date was meaningful to me. It's engraved on my champagne flutes which are now useless. My honeymoon couldn't be salvaged. We were originally going to St. Lucia, but that was booked up in July so we've switched to Barbados. It's fine; it doesn't matter where we go — but summer flights and vacations are almost double the price of what I was paying to go away in March. That's an added expense we weren't counting on.

I made dozens of overnight bags for the guests who were staying in the hotel; they were filled with personalized water bottles and other dated items which have to be scrapped. Our favors will have to be rewrapped and tagged with our new date, the personalized T-shirts my mom made will now never be worn. Our bridal party gifts were dated and have to be redone. I have everything stored in a spare room, and day by day I realize more and more things that will have to be changed.

I'm worried.

Because we canceled less than a week before the wedding, all of our vendors were already paid in full. I'm confident the payments will be honored and our wedding will eventually go off without a hitch — but we poured all of our money into this big day that still hasn't happened, and now there will be more expenses to come.

Our new date is only a few months away so we're in the process of reprinting and resending invitations, but I'm nervous about making that move. Will this be over by then? Will we get close to that date and realize we have to postpone once again? Right now I feel as if my life is on hold.

Overall I know we're lucky. I'm a teacher and my fiancé is a cop, so we both are still working and we both have our health. A $3,000 loss is tough to bear, especially when so many people are out of work, but it could have been so much worse. My friends and family have been so supportive, and I keep telling myself the worst possible scenario has already happened. It can only get better from here.",real

Borders, who made his fortune by founding Borders and Webvan, is now preparing to launch a new grocery delivery startup, HDS, as online food shopping remains one of the few bright spots in the economy.

But other startups in industries hit harder by the coronavirus might not have it so easy, Borders acknowledged.""Be ready to pivot, and pivot hard,"" Borders advised.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Louis Borders has watched the economy go through some dramatic cycles over the last half-century, boosting businesses to sky-high levels and then dragging them down.

But he says that the dot.com bust, the 2008 recession, and every other recession that he's lived through never reached the scale of the current downturn.

""In my lifetime, we haven't had anything like this,"" the 71-year-old entrepreneur told Business Insider. ""It's a completely new world.""

Over the years, Borders has made a name for himself as an entrepreneur to watch. He founded the bookstore chain Borders, which was valued at $190 million when Borders sold it to Kmart in 1992 (the chain later made its debut on the public market and eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2011).

He then made his way to Silicon Valley, where his grocery delivery startup Webvan attracted funding from SoftBank, Sequoia, and Benchmark.

But Borders has also personally experienced the extent to which a downturn can bring a business crashing down: Webvan made its debut on the public market in 2001, and proceeded to run into a stream of troubles. Borders had already stepped down as CEO in 1999, but he watched his brainchild spiral downwards and eventually file for bankruptcy in 2001.

Now, as he prepares to launch a new grocery delivery startup at a moment when online grocery orders are surging, Borders is hesitant to offer advice to other startups that may be squeezed by the current business disruptions, because luck can play such a big role in making or breaking their fates.

""I don't even know what to say — we happen to be fortunate that it [the coronavirus] was great for our business but if you are a company that's based in retail stores, then you're really in trouble,"" Borders said. Plans for his new startup HDS have been in the works for years now. ""It's just kind of luck... I'm humbled by it.""

Still, he has a few fail-safe lessons that he's picked up over the years.

""The basics of good startups, to me, is to pay attention to your talent, respect your investors, and be really upfront with where you are and what you're doing,"" Borders said.

And right now, as the coronavirus reshapes the economic landscape, Borders suggests that startups lean into the change.

""You have to be ready to pivot, and pivot hard,"" he said. ""Don't fight the change that this is causing your business.""",real

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to reduce the involvement of Chinese telecommunication company Huawei in the country’s 5G network rollout, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The move comes alongside plans by the United Kingdom to end its reliance on the eastern Asian country for strategic imports, including medical supplies, amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“He [Johnson] still wants a relationship with China but the Huawei deal is going to be significantly scaled back. Officials have been instructed to come up with a plan to reduce Huawei’s involvement as quickly as possible,” a source said, cited by the newspaper.

Johnson is reportedly intending to scale down China’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023, according to the newspaper.

Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, according to Reuters. Huawei has not replied to a comment request by the outlet.

The report comes ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled June visit to the US for the G7 summit, according to the Telegraph.

Cutting Huawei’s involvement in the UK's 5G rollout is also considered a step toward boosting post-Brexit trade talks with the Trump administration, which has consistently accused Beijing of being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, The Times reported that Johnson had ordered Downing Street officials to prepare a plan to put an end to the country’s reliance on China for key goods. Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.

The aim of the effort, codenamed ""Project Defend"", is said to pinpoint Britain’s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by “potentially hostile” foreign nation's to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.

London has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.

The UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain “safety-related” and “safety-critical” networks.

Washington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country’s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.

In May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company's hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.

Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.

The US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.",fake

Business bosses have written to Boris Johnson to demand the urgent creation of ""air bridges"" to low-risk countries to prevent Britain's controversial quarantine ""risking major damage to the arteries of UK trade"".

The letter, seen by The Telegraph, urged the prime minister to act, as otherwise, the UK would be pushed ""to the back of the queue as states begin conversations for opening up their borders"" against the backdrop of the gradually easing pandemic.

It also touched upon Boris Johnson's intention to conduct thorough checks into all airport arrivals, including cargo:

""We have serious reservations about a blanket approach to all arrivals, irrespective of where passengers are originating from"", the letter, whose signatories include Airlines UK, the Federation of Small Businesses, Make UK, UKHospitality, and the British Chambers of Commerce, asserts.

Such a line of action, it warns, would adversely affect tourism, hospitality, and other business sectors that rely heavily on air travel.

""Air bridges to low or no-infection countries could be a vital step towards allowing British businesses to maintain connectivity as part of a sensible, risk-based measure"", the letter suggests.

The concept is believed to have the backing of Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. But sources said officials in the Foreign Office and Department of Health were opposed due to concerns that Britain could import new outbreaks of coronavirus, despite assurances that the countries in question have battled the coronavirus.

The split over air bridges comes as a senior transport official reportedly issued an edict to airline leaders last week telling them not to publicly denounce the Johnson-declared travel quarantine. Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, jumped at the chance to rip the plans.

""It is bonkers. It has no credibility"", he said, suggesting that Johnson could be ""blurting out something on quarantines, and they have to make it up as they go along afterwards"".

He also assumed the air travel limitations would be soon scrapped whatever the case, as most European countries ""will have already lifted"" them by early June.

Then he's going to pretend the problem simply doesn't exist despite a rising national death toll.

This is what incompetent authoritarians do when they have problems. They try to bend reality using lies and propaganda.

The problem with this strategy, when it comes to the coronavirus, is that many Americans won't have the luxury of joining Trump in his fantasy. They'll be too busy trying to keep one another alive.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

President Donald Trump has found a way forward for his administration in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and it comes straight from the Soviet playbook.

It looks like this: Declare victory over a problem, and then lie and obfuscate no matter how clear it becomes that the problem still remains.

That's it. That's the plan, if you can call it a plan. To be more accurate you might call it a performance. Trump is acting out a reality different from the one that exists before the eyes of many Americans, and his gamble is that the performance will be so strong — helped along by the instruments of his office and surrogates in politics and the media — that Americans will leave the reality they see and join his fantasy.

This imposition on reality is something you see more often in totalitarian regimes, like the Soviet Union, where leaders also use the threat of violence to reinforce their narratives. It's a magical thinking that allows leaders to abdicate their responsibility to take care of society and focus only on hoarding political power. Now Trump is using it to avoid the painful work of governing during a pandemic.

It will be a difficult task. With more than 80,000 Americans dead from COVID-19 and hot spots reappearing in China, Singapore, and South Korea, we are starting to see that this virus will not give up without a fight. It will be a fight many will be unable to wish away.

Declaring victory mid-pandemic

The White House declaration of victory over the coronavirus is upon us. At a press conference on Monday, Trump said the US had ""prevailed"" in ramping up testing and congratulated his administration on its accomplishments. Soon, he told reporters, every American who wanted to get a test could get a test — a promise he made back in March that has yet to be fulfilled.

For weeks Trump has been pressing aggressively for the country to reopen economically, even though the White House's own projections see cases continuing to rise through May. And already the Trump administration is trying to decide on a ""final death count"" (though people are still, and will still be, dying of COVID-19).

The cover-up of the Trump administration's pitiful handling of the coronavirus is upon us too. The White House has limited the ability of key members of the White House coronavirus task force, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, to testify to the Democrat-controlled House about the pandemic response. A whistleblower has filed a complaint accusing the administration of downplaying the coronavirus from the beginning and failing to adequately prepare in the early stages of the pandemic.

During testimony on Tuesday to a Senate committee, Fauci told Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts point-blank: ""If you think we have it under control, we don't."" This is the kind of display — a kind of injection of reality — that the White House has tried to prevent.

The failures continue. The White House developed guidelines to help states determine when to reopen, but some states are opening even though the guidelines haven't been met. Based on Trump's actions, though, it's clear he couldn't care less. Last month the White House shelved a more detailed and rigorous step-by-step guide from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to reopen safely, according to the Associated Press. Those guidelines were supposed to be released last Friday, but the White House thought they were too stringent.

All of this denial just adds danger to this disaster. It will only make those who accept Trump's fantasy much more cavalier with their health and the health of those around them.

What should be a federally coordinated effort to get all 50 states through this pandemic, guided by public-health officials working with the facts at hand has become a political litmus test for loyalty to Trump. In Congress — the branch meant to have oversight over the government — the GOP is complaining that the creation of a coronavirus oversight committee is a partisan witch hunt against the president.

Americans — who are seeing millions of jobs get destroyed and are making massive sacrifices to get through the pandemic — apparently don't have the right to ask questions about what went wrong in the initial response to the outbreak. Facts are not welcome here.

Dreams of a demagogue

Trump is doing exactly what incompetent autocrats do when they don't have solutions. They pretend the problem doesn't exist.

Trump can't get the coronavirus under control. He doesn't have the pain tolerance, work ethic, or skill to deal with this. Neither do most of the rest of the people working for him.

He'd rather be golfing, so he's going to construct a reality in which he can get back to doing just that. That reality will then be passed to us through White House briefings and Fox News and other right-wing media. They will continue to insist that the belief or disbelief of the pandemic's severity is a political act rather than a factual matter.

This reality-distortion phenomenon works in authoritarian nations because governments have the power to impose their version of events on society. While Trump has only partial control over the media and Congress, authoritarians have full control over the media and the levers of power. With those tools in hand authoritarians can ensure that any other account of what transpired is simply not given any oxygen, no matter how true it might be. Citizens are forced to accept a reality that contradicts what they're seeing right in front of their faces because they have no choice.

The Soviets succeeded in imposing their reality on society by weaving the ideology of into the fabric of everyday life. Everything was seen through a political lens. Children were taught to emulate Stalin-era folk heroes, whose great acts of valor were turning in any family members who showed signs of wavering from the Communist Party. Holidays were all political — just a means to reinforce the regime's ideology and box out opposing narratives.

And this imposition of reality mostly worked, even when it came to massive events. It allowed Josef Stalin to hide an empire-wide famine that killed 5 million people across the Soviet Union in 1932 and 1933. Statistics were altered, the media (even foreign correspondents) made no noise, and citizens were scared to talk about it.

""Officially, there was no famine,"" William Henry Chamberlin, the Moscow correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor at the time, said, but ""to anyone who lived in Russia in 1933 and who kept his eyes and ears open, the historicity of the famine is simply not in question.""

Of course, there are events that transcend this subjugation of material fact. The Soviets tried to use their reality-distortion field during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, for example, but the problem was simply too big for them to lie away.

In the coming months we'll see how many Americans are sucked into Trump's version of that reality-distortion field.

He has taken the autocratic step of making the coronavirus political, thus injecting politics into everyday life in a way most Americans have never experienced. He's using textbook tricks to confuse people about what's going on — like questioning the coronavirus death toll, blaming China for all his failures, and refusing to acknowledge issues with supplies at hospitals around the country.

Trump claimed that he's the ""king of ventilators."" In reality he's the emperor of wearing no clothes.

Sure, Trump's most devoted supporters are likely to join his reality simply because they want to. It won't matter what's going on around them. The rest of this country, though, will have to square what Trump has said and done (or is saying and doing) with the world around them — with a rising national death toll and with sick friends, neighbors, and relatives they're worried about.

They'll have to wear masks, keep washing their hands, and work from home if they're lucky enough to be able to. Their day-to-day lives will change until there's a coronavirus vaccine, no matter what Trump says or does.

So for some Americans, joining Trump's coronavirus-free fantasy will not be an option. ""Reality,"" a former president said in a time that seems long, long ago, ""has a way of asserting itself.""",real

As of this writing, more than 80,000 Americans have contracted and died from the coronavirus. But how many have or will die from what some call ""despair""?

Consider the following call to my radio show:

""Hi, Larry. I was calling about people who have called suicide hotlines and different things with this loss of income. I am a widow of somebody who did commit suicide because of income. It was not now, during the epidemic, but it was because of dwindling income and hopelessness, which he hid from me. I had no idea this was going on in his business life. And I came home from work one day and found him hanging in the garage. He did leave a note about the different debts and things like that, but financial problems are a horrible thing — just a horrible thing that's worse than the virus.""

No doubt going back to work increases a person's chances of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.

A new report, ""Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,"" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from ""despair"" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic. One of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, California, said: ""Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward."" The study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related ""deaths of despair"" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, ""The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.""

About the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: ""I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.""

Earlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment. ""Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,"" said study author Carlos Nordt. ""Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon."" The study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: ""While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.""

Unemployment stands at 14.7%, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated. Betsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of ""people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,"" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20%.

A new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season. Defying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career. Reinsdorf said to Jordan, ""If you had a terrible headache, and I gave you a bottle of pills, and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?"" Jordan responded, ""It depends on how bad the f—-ing headache is.""

Former chair of the Commons Select Committee Damian Collins has called on the UK government to provide financial support for vulnerable football clubs.

Collins claims that in next five weeks five to 10 EFL League clubs could go into administration.

""We saw the outcry last summer when two clubs, Bury and Bolton, were in trouble. If that happens there will be huge public demand to do something,” he said as quoted by the Sky Sports News.

""Without the government stepping in, those clubs could go to the wall and there maybe others that follow,"" he added.

He added that many League 1 and 2 teams in the EFL were in a risky state even before the Covid-19 pandemic began.

According to him, taxpayers' money should not be used to buy players but should solely be used to guarantee that clubs are financially sustainable.

The Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic and is looking to restart its campaign in mid-June.

Hundreds of protesters converged on Downtown L.A. on Friday, May 1, as tensions flared over stay-at-home orders that have exacerbated already raw political divisions across the nation.

For many downtown, those orders — staying home, staying at least six feet away from each other, wearing face masks and not gathering unless its for essential business — took a backseat to skirmishes, shouting matches and chants and strong emotions that boiled over in the heat of the Civic Center.

By noon, LAPD had moved in, looking to separate one group waving signs that said “Humanity First” and another with signs that said “America First.”

At one point, Spring Street in front of City Hall, had been closed between Temple Street and 1st Street as LAPD worked to contain what was at least three converging protests, dividing opposing protesters on either side of the roadway.

It was a mix of differing interests on what in the pre-COVID-19 era likely would have been a May Day pro-labor event with thousands on foot downtown advocating for worker and immigrant rights.

The rally decrying social distancing restrictions was designed to draw thousands to the Civic Center by foot and by vehicle, despite warnings from public health officials amid state, city and county guidelines aiming to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in the county.

The frustration was evident among those gathered at City Hall, where flag-waving demonstrators displayed signs with such messages as “Shutdown is Killing Small Biz” and “Freedom.”

“I just want to go back to work. To feed my family,” said Jared Clement, of San Pedro, who had come to join a group of protesters calling on local leaders to ease restrictions.

Many were draped in the American flag. Some wore masks. Others didn’t, defying public health orders. Others simply said being there was “freedom” -freedom to assemble.

Jessie Gates, 22, of Rancho Palos Verdes said her church in Torrance was affected by the orders, which have made it tough to worship.

“Democrats are terrible people,” said Kristy Reyes, 40, of San Bernardino. “They planned this, they did this.”

She said the health risks are exaggerated, and did not believe there have been 1,172 deaths from COVID-19 in LA County from the virus.

“If I get sick, I get sick. Life’s a risk,” she said.

At one point, some in the group started chanting “Four More Years.”

But wearing masks, and holding banners, counterprotesters moved in not long afterward.

“What they are advocating will spell mass death,” said Noche Diaz, with a group called RevCom, which was counter-protesting. He added that the while “we are trying to practice social distancing, we have been consistently attacked … .”

He blamed the anti-lockdown movement on President Donald Trump, but even as he spoke to a reporter through a facemask, another protester pushed back, saying “I’m not with Trump.”

In response to protests throughout California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday said, “All I ask for is this: Take care of yourself. Do justice to physical distancing. You don’t want to contract this disease. .. Just protect yourself. Protect your family…. the people you are protesting with and thank them fror their expression of free speech.”

But he did not suggest any legal actions for violating restriction orders.

“If you look at those death certificates, all Americans are represented in terms of that tragic loss of life, regardless of their political stripes.”

Still, there was concern among local officials that the rallies were defeating the public health purpose even while acknowledging the right to protest.

“If they were practicing social distancing and wearing masks,” said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger. “I’m sure there would be a lot more sympathy. “Crowds that are not wearing masks, that are literally on top of each other protesting, it doesn’t further their cause.

“And it actually, to me, makes the argument the governor was making: When you don’t social distance and you don’t practice safe social distancing, you are continuing to the spread of this virus.”

A similar protest was planned in Orange County, where Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered beaches closed after last weekend’s re-opening drew crowds and spurred concerns about a lack of social distancing.

Meanwhile, the LA street vendor caravan has arrived to the Dept of Public Works building downtown. They're demanding financial assistance and an end to fines on vendors choosing to work without a permit during the crisis #MayDay pic.twitter.com/kTiyD4TjLj — Ariella Plachta (@AriPlachta) May 1, 2020

A third group — a caravan of street vendors that had come from five points in the city — was also rolling through. That group was demanding relief from public officials over how the pandemic has crippled their business. But they got caught in the middle of the competing demonstrations.

At one point, police told them to move off of Spring Street, where dozens of cars and trucks had rolled through. They were headed to the front of the city’s Department of Public Works and its Bureau of Street Services. But ended up making their demands in front of the L.A. County Board of Supervisor’s building.

The anti-lockdown group was demanding L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and Gov. Newsom:

Lift the lockdown on non-essential businesses, which the group said is unconstitutional and has caused unemployment to skyrocket and businesses to permanently close;

End shelter-in-place orders, which the group said have resulted in hunger and mental illness, prompted by isolation;

Leave the choice of wearing protective attire, such as face masks, up to the individual; and

Open all state and city parks, beaches, golf courses and other facilities.

“We’re just defending our constitutional rights,” said Juliet Annerino, who helped organize the noon demonstration.

Police said they’ve seen much worse, and for the most part let the tension play out.

“You’re going to have some tension at protests,” LAPD Officer Drake Madison said, adding for the most part the rallies were peaceful. “But that’s why they’re protests, people are exercising their rights. We’re just here to help them facilitate, and there were no issues.”

The anti-stay-at-home rally came on the heels of another rally last month in Huntington Beach that was largely peaceful but did result in some tension and one arrest.

Such rallies have popped up across the country as lawmakers echo warnings from public health officials that easing social distancing restrictions too quickly could refuel the virus that feeds off of crowded settings.

As it stands, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the county’s order — which began on March 19 and was extended until May 15 — has been working to contain the spread, according to the county’s statistical models.

Such orders have not persuaded such groups around the nation, however.

Thousands of flag-waving, honking protesters drove past the Michigan Capitol in mid-April to show their displeasure with the state’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s orders to keep people at home and businesses locked. On Thursday, a mostly peaceful repeat demonstration led to some angry protesters — many without face coverings and some with guns — entering the Michigan Capitol and demanding to be let onto the House floor, which is not allowed.",real

The weekend marked the first time in eight weeks in which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Ezike didn’t stand before the cameras for daily COVID-19 briefings. Instead, Ezike — a mother of four — spent her Sunday delivering a lengthy sermon for Hope Church via their Facebook page.

“This Mother’s Day is especially challenging. That’s putting it ever so mildly,” Ezike said. “No one will ever forget Mother’s Day 2020.”

“Many of us can’t visit and celebrate this day in person with our mothers in the traditional way. For some, a visit would be putting our loved mother, our beloved mother, at risk of contracting this virus that we’ve all become intimately aware of,” Ezike said. “Some of our mothers are in a nursing home, where visitation is now banned, again, for their safety. Maybe your mother is no longer with us on this side of Earth.”

The state has lost 3,406 people to COVID-19, including 1,553 in the nursing homes.

“And then there are over 1,000 mothers that we have lost in Illinois alone to this awful coronavirus in just the last two months,” Ezike said.

Ezike said her spirituality helped her cope with the loss of her father, who died in February in California just before the pandemic began its rapid spread. And the health director said she’s “running on fumes with little to no sleep” and is humbled and grateful to be leading the state’s response to the virus.

Ezike heads the state’s Department of Public Health after being the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center’s medical director during 15 years working for Cook County Health. An internist and pediatrician, she oversaw medical care at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center during the 2009 H1N1 flu virus pandemic.

“Who am I to even be here before you? A daughter of poor African immigrants, born in California, and now leading the state of Illinois through a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years,” Ezike said. “The impossible becomes possible when you see that God is in it. The fact that I’m involved in this pandemic with all my imperfections flaring and glaring is just because I am part of his perfect plan.”",real

Businesses from airlines to small stores are reeling from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nearly two-month lockdown of India’s 1.3 billion people aimed at limiting the spread of the new coronavirus. Many firms say they won’t survive unless they are bailed out immediately.

The government said on Sunday it would privatize state-run companies in non-strategic sectors and stop fresh insolvency cases for a year.

But apart from that its plans entail a mix of easy loan schemes, a bit more money for a rural job-guarantee program, and a slew of long-awaited policy reforms across sectors that will take effect over the medium-term.

Combined, this is not enough of a boost to prevent a likely 5% contraction in Asia’s third-largest economy in fiscal 2020/2021, Goldman Sachs said on Monday. It said it expected the economy to shrink an eye-watering 45% on an annualized basis in the quarter to the end of June.

Business leaders are unimpressed by the government’s response.

“We are creating all sorts of liquidity for supply, but what about the demand,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson of Biocon Limited, one of the country’s top health firms.

“Demand is going to play a very big part in economic revival, and if we cannot kick-start demand I fear than we cannot have economic revival. I think we have lost a big opportunity,” she said.

A breakdown of the rescue plan shows that the actual spending of the government is only about a tenth of the $266 billion package, which Modi had hailed as 10% of India’s gross domestic product in line with the big stimulus plans announced by other major economies.

A large part of the rest of the package is actually loans provided by banks, many of them without collateral, leveraging $105 billion of liquidity provided by the central bank, government officials said.

“We would not qualify it as a stimulus package ... Only 1% of GDP is given to compensate for the income loss, which is not likely to be sufficient, “ said Sunil Tirumalai of brokerage Emkay Global.

One percent of GDP would amount to about $29 billion - and the government may well spend even less than that as it fears a sovereign rating downgrade.

GOVT ‘HAS LIMITED RESOURCES’

Two government officials said the government estimates total spending of $27 billion from the budget this year towards the rescue measures, which would prevent the fiscal deficit from widening more than 100 basis points beyond the target of 3.5% of GDP.

The finance ministry must also assess the scale of intervention required if the coronavirus pandemic drags on for longer than currently expected, officials said.

“We do not know how the situation would evolve or how long it will go on for. We need to prepare for that as well, as the government has limited resources and needs to spend wisely,” said one of the officials, who did not want to be named.

Distress is mounting across the economy. Emkay estimated the cost of the lockdown at around $170 billion overall.

Indian airlines are taking an average daily loss of $10 million-$12 million and will need extra funding of 325 billion-350 billion rupees ($4.3 billion-$4.6 billion) in the next two years, according to ratings agency ICRA, a unit of Moody’s.

Airlines have been cutting staff and wages to avoid defaulting on debts to their lessors or banks, even as their fixed costs such as servicing and parking fees keep mounting.

The government has also provided no support to the tourism industry, which is likely to see tens of thousands of job cuts and small firms going bankrupt, the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality said.

And a fifth of the 70 million retail traders who form the bedrock of Modi’s political support may go under because they are unable to pay wages and rent.

With the lockdown now extended to the end of May, only one thing seems certain: The road back to economic health is going to be long and hard.

“A steep fall in output this year is certain. And we continue to believe that the recovery will be slow,” said Shilan Shah from research firm Capital Economics.

Outside of his work for RT, he travels around the country and produces video content for foreigners interested in Russia. Follow him on twitter @jonnytickle

One of the greatest cons perpetrated by some elements in the Western press and the think-tank racket is that they genuinely care about the average Russian person. But in the time of coronavirus, the mask has truly slipped.

As the worldwide pandemic rages, you'd expect that the usual suspects would lay off vilification of “the Russians.” Unfortunately, it seems precisely the opposite is happening, with a particular cohort finding great amusement in suicide attempts by Russian doctors. Seemingly, the plight of medical staff and their ever-worsening mental health is cause for jesting and joking – all because of their nationality.

Last week, Russian media reported that a third medical worker in less than a fortnight had fallen to the ground from the window of a building. At the time of writing, two are confirmed dead, and the other is in intensive care, but now conscious and breathing on his own.

As news of the incident emerged, media from around the world began drumming up conspiracy theories, with Vox asking, “Is the Russian government surreptitiously killing people who speak out about the failures of the country’s coronavirus response?”

Vox's cast of conspiracy-peddling characters includes Alina Polyakova of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a lobby group funded by weapons manufacturers, the US-government, and NATO. “I would not be surprised if the security services were involved, sending a message to keep quiet on the crisis,” she said.

The reality is, in fact, much more tragic.

On April 24, Natalya Lebedeva, head of the emergency medical department in Star City, outside Moscow, fell to her death from a hospital window, where she had been hospitalized herself with suspected Covid-19. Star City is a small and closed community, home to Russia’s military research and space training facility.

According to the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, Lebedeva’s colleagues suspect she committed suicide due to accusations from her superiors that she had not taken sufficient measures to ensure the safety of her employees, and had subsequently allowed several medical workers to become infected. Officials claim it was an accident and say it is being investigated.

One day later, on April 25, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, the acting head physician of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Hospital for War Veterans, fell from her office window. Krasnoyarsk is a city in East Siberia, over 3,000km away from Moscow.

According to local news outlet TVK Krasnoyarsk, Nepomnyashchaya’s fall occurred after a conference call with the head of the regional Ministry of Health, Boris Nemik, in which they were discussing how the hospital could be re-profiled to accept coronavirus patients. Nepomnyashchaya allegedly opposed the intake of those infected with Covid-19, believing it did not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE). Nemik denies this call ever happened. On May 1, Nepomnyashchaya died in intensive care.

The third incident followed a week later. On May 2, ambulance doctor Alexander Shulepov fell from the window of the Novousmansky District Hospital in the Voronezh Region, 470km south of Moscow. Unlike the other two medics, Shulepov is still alive.

Shulepov’s story is by far the most complicated of the three. Prior to his fall, the doctor had published a video, complaining that he was being forced to work after a Covid-19 diagnosis, and exposing a shortage of PPE.

As of now, nobody knows precisely what happened to Shulepov, but there are indications his fall was either an attempted suicide or an accident. As he fell from a window on the first floor of a building, it’s highly unlikely this was a murder attempt – after all, it’s probable that someone would survive a fall from such a low height. According to local news outlet RIA Voronezh, the most likely cause was that he slipped while smoking a cigarette on the windowsill.

The international reaction to the third fall featured lots of mocking and jeering. Apparently, the death of Russian medical staff is a cause of great hilarity. Nate Schenkkan, the Director for Special Research at US government-funded pressure group Freedom House, thought it funny to sum up the suicide of heavily strained Russian doctors as a “pandemic of defenestration.”

The former President of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, also deemed what seems to be a mental health crisis to be high-quality comedic material. Later his tweet mocking the suicides was deleted.

Here's the former President of Estonia, @ilvestoomas. A truly shameful tweet. pic.twitter.com/mOxpoX2Mji — Bryan MacDonald (@27khv) May 4, 2020

The hilarity wasn't just limited to the likes of think-tanks and politicians, of course. The New York Times' former Moscow bureau chief, Neil MacFarquhar, also believed it suitable to make light of the situation.

A doctor not yet fallen out a window — Neil MacFarquhar (@NeilMacFarquhar) May 5, 2020

Unfortunately, Russia's situation seems to be reflective of a grim international trend, in which medical workers from around the world are under constant strain, as the battle to defeat Covid-19 seems never-ending.

In late April, two over-worked American medics committed suicide, both in New York City. Emergency medical technician John Mondello and physician Lorna Breen both suffered under the intense strain of treating patients of Covid-19. In France, Bernard Gonzalez, a medic working with football team Stade Reims, took his own life after contracting coronavirus. Thankfully, these deaths were not mocked.

Many other countries have issues with the mental health of medical professionals, and nobody has believed it suitable to make jokes. That is a treatment reserved exclusively for Russians.

Indeed, it seems like everyone has a free pass when it comes to Russia. In the modern world, where racism, xenophobia, and bigotry are rightly considered disgusting, there's still one final group it's okay to despise. Even amid a global pandemic, there's one thing we're all allowed to do: mock the Russians.

- Travel companies soar

- Oil market hopes

TRAVEL BUGS. Americans are ready to hit the road. That at least is the message from the stock market on Monday. Shares in car-rental firm Avis Budget zoomed ahead more than 20%. Hertz Global, which on Monday also removed boss Kathryn Marinello from the driver’s seat, was up almost as much.

United Airlines and Spirit Airlines soared highest in their industry, with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines following with 13%, and American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in single digits.

Hotel chains rose, too, though slightly less. InterContinental Hotels was up by 9% and Hyatt Hotels by 13%. Perhaps shareholders expect vacationers to stay with family – or sleep in rental cars. But they certainly are seeking fresh air. Shares in casinos like Las Vegas Sands were up just 4% or so – a sign Americans don’t want to swap lockdowns at home for vacations inside.

TIME-TRAVELING OIL. Four weeks is a long time in the market for black gold. On Monday the price for West Texas Intermediate futures were changing hands for almost $32 a barrel for the forward-month contract, which expires on Tuesday. That’s despite the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission warning last week that prices could still go negative, just as they did for the previous forward-month contract in mid-April.

Oil watchers were hopeful about global supply cuts kicking in, Reuters reported Monday, though U.S. fields are causing the biggest problems. And yet, there’s a bright side: The number of U.S. rigs in operation plunged to 339, 190 fewer than at the start of the year, according to Evercore ISI.

With some large American cities slowly opening, and industrial giants like Ford Motor firing up plants, demand hopes are revving up too. These could still be dashed. But with oil prices now at levels not seen since early March, traders are starting to look like they’re throwing caution to the wind. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

CHECKERED FLAGS IN VACCINE RACE. Moderna’s vaccine for Covid-19 hasn’t even completed one lap, but Wall Street assumes it’s heading for victory. The U.S. biotech company said on Monday that interim results from an early trial were promising. That tacked nearly $7 billion onto its now-$31 billion market capitalization. With late-stage clinical trials scheduled to begin in July, there could be a vaccine by fall.

Or that’s the theory. Moderna said the initial eight patients tested produced the same or greater concentrations of antibodies that can neutralize the virus as “generally seen” in recovered patients. But it’s unclear if antibodies are key to eliminating the virus. Some recovered people have very low levels. Moreover, even though the trial was small, several volunteers had severe temporary adverse effects. It’s far too early to assume this will pass the finish line, much less take the prize.

EASY TARGETS. UK grocer executives and their investors could be victims of their own success. That’s if the UK government introduces a windfall tax to raise much needed cash from businesses which have thrived during the coronavirus lockdown. Punters are keen. A recent YouGov survey found that 53% of people would support a so-called “excess profit tax.”

Hitting the grocers could be harder than it sounds. True, both Tesco and J Sainsbury enjoyed record sales in March, as customers rushed to stock up on loo roll and pasta. But Tesco boss Dave Lewis recently warned the group will take a hit of up to 925 million pounds from virus-related costs, like hiring 45,000 extra staff. The government may struggle to tax online giant Amazon.com, which books most of its UK revenue through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Still, retailers would only have themselves to blame. Ocado recently paid CEO Tim Steiner a 59 million-pound pay packet for 2019. Tesco churned out a 635 million-pound dividend in April, despite benefitting from state support on property taxes. Such largesse will make it difficult to plead poverty. (By Aimee Donnellan)

M&A MATTERS. JPMorgan’s dealmakers have some tips for chief executives contemplating a merger or acquisition. Having crunched the numbers on mega-deals struck during the last crisis, the bankers’ first lesson is that CEOs should take the initiative. Over three-quarters of the deals reviewed began with a buyer’s approach. Second, pay up: the median U.S. control premium during 2008 and 2009 was around 36%, compared with 27% from 2000 to 2019.

That’s because equity markets plummeted, meaning CEOs could offer more relative to prevailing share prices. Still, it confounds the logic for corona-crisis dealmaking today. The S&P 500 is down just 11% this year, compared with a much steeper fall in 2008, meaning CEOs have little room to sweeten control premiums. Meanwhile, the earnings they’re buying are just as uncertain, given the chance of a second virus wave. Little wonder M&A has shrivelled. (By Liam Proud)

EMIRHAD? Dubai-based airline Emirates is making drastic turns to weather the coronavirus storm, cutting 30,000 jobs, or a third of its workforce, according to Bloomberg. It’s also accelerating the retirement of its 100-plus A380 superjumbos. If that doesn’t restore stability, Emirates could try a more radical manoeuvre – a merger with local rival Etihad.

There are plenty of impediments, not least tensions between their respective homes, flashy Dubai and staid but uber-wealthy Abu Dhabi. That probably rules out the most obvious cost-saving – squashing their two hubs, now 60 kilometres (40 miles) apart, into one. But Abu Dhabi already bailed out Dubai in the financial crisis, and it needs to do something with Etihad, which made a $1.3 billion operating loss in 2018. Copying International Consolidated Airlines’ holding-company structure for British Airways and Spain’s Iberia might spare national blushes and reap some of the benefits of flying in formation.

RECKLESS DRIVING. Tianqi Lithium, a producer of the key ingredient for electric-vehicle batteries, is in talks with lenders to restructure its debt. Prices for the white metal have collapsed on the back of rapid expansion of mines. China’s easing of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles meant demand was already moderating, and the coronavirus promises to delay any recovery.

That’s left the Shenzhen-listed company in a rut. Its market value is now less than the $4.1 billion it paid for a minority stake in Chilean miner SQM in 2018. Total debt will remain at nearly 9 times EBITDA over the next 12 months, Moody’s wrote in April. Selling equity and strategic assets will help, but a reset of loans is a tacit admission that any proceeds will be underwhelming in a buyer’s market. (By Sharon Lam)",real

The Obama administration had in fact prepared a 69-page playbook for pandemic response — which the Trump administration appeared to not follow.

""I was wrong,"" McConnell said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. ""They did leave behind a plan. So, I clearly made a mistake in that regard.""

McConnell also said he didn't know whether the Trump administration was following the guidance prepared by the president's predecessor.

""As to whether or not the plan was followed and who is the critic and all the rest, I don't have any observation about that because I don't know enough about the details of that, Bret, to comment on it in any detail,"" the Kentucky Republican said.

At a virtual campaign event for Mr. Trump on Monday, McConnell blamed the Obama administration for not taking steps to be ready for a potential pandemic.

""We want to be early, ready for the next one, because clearly the Obama administration did not leave to this administration any kind of game plan for something like this,"" McConnell told Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law. ""

McConnell also said it was ""classless"" for Obama to criticize Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, and said the former president ""should have kept his mouth shut."" Mr. Obama said in a private call to supporters last week that the Trump administration's response has been ""an absolute chaotic disaster.""

The Obama administration did in fact pass along a comprehensive pandemic plan, including a 69-page playbook for an early response to infectious diseases. Politico reported on the playbook in March and noted that the Trump administration lagged or did not follow through on many of its steps.

I've had people tweet at me in the past 24 hours: Did the pandemic playbook really exist?

Was it really a clearly marked ""playbook""?

Would it have helped? Here's the cover, and the table of contents. You decide. pic.twitter.com/PMWr8YjIMu — Ronald Klain (@RonaldKlain) May 12, 2020

The playbook included recommendations for a ""unified message"" from a ""single federal spokesperson,"" and for invoking the Defense Production Act, which Mr. Trump hesitated to use in the early weeks of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump also disbanded the National Security Council's pandemic response unit and sought funding cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before the coronavirus landed in the United States.

Mr. Trump has consistently blamed Mr. Obama for difficulties during the pandemic response, alleging that the previous administration didn't leave a sufficient stockpile or a plan for a pandemic on the scale of the coronavirus.",real

The concert notification service can now push out a “watch live” notification when musicians are live-streaming shows. These notifications will appear on Bandsintown, along with Facebook pages, Instagram Stories, and other places that surface Bandsintown listings.

Twitch is increasingly becoming a popular place for indie musicians to make money amid the pandemic. With touring essentially at a standstill, many are looking to online platforms in order to try and recoup lost funds from shows.

Additionally, Bandsintown has launched its own Twitch channel, with all proceeds going to the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. The first show features South African DJ Black Coffee and will stream at 1PM ET today.

Bandsintown says it’s starting the channel both to connect artists with fans while many are stuck at home and to help raise more funds for MusiCares through Twitch. There are a bunch of ways to financially support streamers on Twitch, as longtime Twitch user Ducky told The Verge yesterday. Users can subscribe to channels or tip small amounts, and Amazon Prime members are able to subscribe to one channel per month for free.

“As true music fans, there are ways you can help us help artists,” reads Bandsintown’s announcement. “If you’re able to, avoid asking for refunds, buy their merch, attend their live shows when they return, donate to tips jars, or donate to MusiCares.”

MusiCares is an arm of the Recording Academy that provides financial relief to those in the music industry facing unexpected hardships. (Disclosure: I’m the vice president of the Chicago chapter of the Recording Academy.) With many musicians currently unable to tour and out of work, the organization recently launched a separate fund specifically for artists and other industry professionals affected by the pandemic.

Bandsintown says its next live stream is scheduled for next week, and it will be a multiday live music marathon featuring both emerging and established artists.",real

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.

Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

“Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”

Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama. https://t.co/ofKNYvrRKl — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 18, 2020

Sherman attempted to explain away the matter by suggesting that to unmask an American “caught” communicating with a foreign official of a hostile country is routine, even advisable. But the question frames the matter incorrectly. – READ MORE

News of a possible vaccine breakthrough was somewhat overshadowed by President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement hours later that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 preventive treatment, contrary to medical warnings about such use of the anti-malaria drug. The disclosure came during Trump’s White House meeting with restaurant executives.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” the president told reporters, saying he has taken a single dose of the drug each day for the past week and a half.

Just 10 days ago the White House confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary had tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 hours after Trump’s military valet was diagnosed.

Trump initially promoted hydroxychloroquine in April as a potential COVID-19 treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus. But subsequent studies have found it to be ineffective, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned of the potential for serious side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and an older, related drug, chloroquine.

VACCINE HOPE

Earlier in the day came word that a COVID-19 vaccine under development by Massachusetts-based biotech firm Moderna Inc had produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers during a safety trial launched in March.

The findings, offering a glimmer of hope that the experimental vaccine may ultimately prove effective, sent Moderna’s shares soaring 20% on Monday and helped lift the overall stock market about 3% to a 10-week high.

Until a vaccine or cure can be found, lockdowns on commerce and social gatherings remain the chief weapon for fighting the pandemic, even while ravaging the U.S. economy.

Public health experts caution that easing stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures is still risky while diagnostic testing remains scant in many places, leaving in doubt how much virus lurks undetected.

Although nearly all 50 states have begun reopening, only 13 had met federal guidelines for safely lifting restrictions as of Sunday, according to a Reuters analysis, raising concerns that infections and deaths could surge anew.

While some consumers have voiced hesitancy about returning to shopping malls and restaurants just yet, others were clearly ready to do so.

“We need to get the economy going again. People are either out of money or will be very soon,” said Martin Bermudez, 48, as he and a companion enjoyed ham-and-cheese omelets at a cafe in Miami.

They were among the first diners back in the eatery for sit-down table service after more than two months of takeout only.

The pandemic has afflicted the United States more than any other country, with more than 1.5 million known infections and nearly 90,000 deaths.

A revision to an influential coronavirus mortality model periodically updated by University of Washington researchers predicted on Monday that 143,357 Americans will die from COVID-19 by early August, about 3,600 fewer than last projected.

The slightly more optimistic forecast reflects greater-than-expected adherence to social distancing and face covering by the public, Dr. Christopher Murray, head of the university’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN.

New York state, epicenter of the U.S. pandemic with 27,400 COVID-19 deaths to date, registered further evidence of improvement as its three-day rolling average of hospitalizations and tally of newly reported fatalities both declined.

FROM SPORTS TO ASSEMBLY LINES

In a sign of growing confidence in curbing the contagion, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was looking forward to professional sports teams to begin competing again, though without fans in attendance.

California Governor Gavin Newsom likewise said his state has been in talks with officials of all major sports leagues about a possible fan-free resumption of play. He added that a possible June 1 opening day would depend on development of new safety standards and the prevailing infection rates in California.

In the San Francisco Bay area, health directors in five counties said manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution could reopen, catching up with a similar loosening of restrictions elsewhere across the state 10 days earlier.

In the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry slowly returned to life from a two-month lockdown as the Detroit Three carmakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines in a sector that employs nearly 1 million people.

Hundreds of workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s (FCA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan, began lining up before dawn for the early shift. Signs overhead read: “Let’s restart.”

The auto industry is widely watched as a test case for whether workers across a range of U.S. industries can safely return to factory floors.

“I’m a little nervous,” said Larry Smith, 53, who works on wheel alignment away from the assembly line. “They made all the precautions (and) they’ve done everything they can to prepare .... I’m trusting in God.”

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

“If we don’t encourage people to get outside, we will have a widespread social insurrection,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “People are already challenged by the isolation imposed by social distancing.”



Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.



When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. Duke University researchers recently reported that Winston, a pug in North Carolina, tested positive for the virus — the first reported canine case in the United States. But the results still need to be confirmed.



If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.



If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, Marrazzo said, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks.” But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And even healthy seniors, she said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.



What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that face coverings be worn in public places to slow spread of the virus, a reversal of previous recommendations.

The CDC’s website says the agency recommends the coverings for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”



Some businesses do not allow customers to enter without wearing masks.

The recommendation was announced in early April by President Trump, who stressed that the guidance was voluntary and said he wasn’t planning to wear a mask. The guidance was issued after a vigorous debate within the administration. Some officials wanted the recommendation targeted primarily to locales that are being especially affected by the virus.



But health officials argued that universal masking was necessary, pointing to new data showing that a high proportion of infected people may not exhibit symptoms, even as they spread the virus by emitting droplets when they talk, sneeze or even exhale. A mask — or some kind of cloth face covering, such as a bandanna or scarf — keeps those people from infecting others, they say.



Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.



Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.



Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can apparently raise the risks of blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.



What are the symptoms of covid-19?

A few months into the crisis, we know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of smell. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC recently added several new symptoms to its list for the coronavirus, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection, the agency said.





What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.





But in some states, laboratories are still overwhelmed by the demand and struggling with shortages of critical items, including chemical components needed to run the tests.

Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses in much of the country. But a “blueprint” presented Monday by Trump leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs.

The United States has run more tests than any other country but trails many nations in per capita testing.

What about home tests?

The FDA has not approved any tests in which the entire process — collection of nasal specimen, followed by processing and result — occur at home. But it did give emergency authorization for a test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. The idea is for consumers to go online and fill out a questionnaire with LabCorp, a North Carolina company. If they meet CDC guidelines for testing, they’ll be sent the Pixel kit that includes swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they can mail them to a LabCorp lab for processing.



LabCorp said it would initially make the test available only to health-care workers and emergency workers showing covid-19 symptoms. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in coming weeks. Allowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, because health-care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.

What about antibody tests?

One of the hottest topics now is serology tests, designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has authorized fewer than 10. The agency has taken a hands-off approach, allowing companies to sell the test after notifying the FDA and saying the tests have been validated. At the same time, the agency and testing experts have warned that some of the tests are being marketed fraudulently and are of dubious quality. The government is trying to validate the unvetted tests, but it is unclear when the data will be available.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

When will this end?

No one knows, though experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. It isn’t clear how the arrival of summer’s warmer weather will affect the virus.

The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.

Several states are lifting, or considering lifting, strict stay-at-home orders to allow some businesses to reopen. Colorado, Georgia and Texas are among those pressing ahead. Even New York, which was hit especially hard, is exploring a loosening of the rules. But public health officials warn state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Even after Americans emerge from their isolation, chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

However, after facing backlash, some restaurants have been forced to remove the surcharges, with many raising menu prices instead.

Fresh meat prices were up 8.1% at the end of April, with experts saying they could rise by up to 20% in the coming weeks.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Angry customers are complaining about restaurants adding COVID-19 surcharges. But, owners say they are simply trying to stay in business as food costs skyrocket.

Earlier this week, a tweet showing the receipt from Kiko Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi Lounge in West Plains, Missouri, went viral after a customer noticed a ""COVID-19 surcharge.""

Many responded with outrage, questioning why the coronavirus pandemic would lead to the restaurant adding on a 5% surcharge.

According to a post on Kiko's Facebook page, the outrage continued off-line. The restaurant owner wrote that employees had been harassed due to the photo of the receipt.

""Please understand we are not doing this to take advantage of you guys!"" the post reads. ""We are doing this hoping we can adjust the surcharge weekly rather than just raise all of our prices on our menu due to increase prices from our supplier on meat, poultry, seafood & produce.""

The post questioned why people were harassing Kiko workers when meat suppliers had raised prices due to the ""broken"" meat supply chain.

Meat plants have been forced to close due to COVID-19 outbreaks in recent weeks, causing prices to skyrocket. Fresh meat prices were up 8.1% at the end of April, and experts say prices could increase by an unprecedented 20% in the coming months.

Kiko announced it would remove the surcharge, instead raising prices on all menu items.

West Plains local news station KY3 reported that two other local restaurants, Ozark Cafe and Bootleggers BBQ, had also added 5% surcharges. While many customers told KY3 they were happy to pay, Buffalo BBQ announced earlier this week it was dropping the surcharge, instead choosing to raise prices.

""We appreciate all of your support and understanding during this very unusual trying times!"" the restaurant posted on Facebook. ""Please remember we are all human, treat each other with decency and respect, and let's try to get along and get through this together!""

Purple Cow, a diner in Kingsport, Tennessee, also ended a surcharge on beef prices this week ""due to confusion."" After a burst of angry Facebook comments, the restaurant announced it would instead change the prices on individual menu items, apologizing for any inconvenience.

Goog's Pub and Grub in Holland, Michigan wrote on Facebook that it has seen remarkable support since adding a $1 ""COVID charge,"" to counteract sky-rocketing beef prices. An Instagram photo, spotted by NBC's Today show, appears to show a $1 carne asada surcharge at Ramberto's in San Diego.",real

As part of the Wisconsin Dells destination, the water ski, sky and stage show was presented each year between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend.

The show traveled to World’s Fairs, on USO tours and to other cultural exchange programs including Chicago lakefront and riverfront festivals.

Most recently, he sat on the board of Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm with a $30 billion valuation that is pursuing a coronavirus vaccine. He resigned when President Trump named him last Thursday to the new post as chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the federal drive for coronavirus vaccines and treatments.

Dr. Slaoui sold his shares on Tuesday, and the administration said he would donate the increased value to cancer research.

Jungkook, the BTS’ main vocalist, visited a restaurant and a bar in the Itaewon neighbourhood with friends on April 25, the boyband’s management Big Hit Entertainment said on Monday.

A new cluster of virus cases emerged in that neighbourhood this month as social distancing measures eased on May 6, prompting authorities to delay school reopening and close bars and clubs again.

“We have no excuse that we placed the artist’s personal life before we were able to emphasise the importance of social distancing. We bow our head in apology,” the company said.

The 22-year old, who was there before the first case among Itaewon clubgoers was confirmed, is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative for the coronavirus, Big Hit said.

“He is also deeply regretting on how he did not follow social distancing measures seriously.”

South Korea has been lauded for its quick and effective response to the pandemic but the resurgence of cases has raised concerns about a second wave of infections here

Before the rules were eased on May 6, authorities had allowed clubs and bars to stay open as long as they complied with strict social distancing measures, while advising people not to visit them.

Local media reported three other boy band members were with Jungkook during that outing, including Cha Eun-woo of Astro, Mingyu of Seventeen and Jaehyun of NCT.

Last month, Lightfoot vowed to be “straightforward and very transparent” with Chicagoans if and when she concluded tax increases were needed to plug the giant hole in her 2020 budget caused by the stay-at-home shutdown of the city’s economy.

On Friday, the tough talk began.

“We’re looking at a range of potential revenue-generating options. Look, the reality is, I don’t think there’s any city budget across the country that is not gonna have to look at one-time measures to put yourself back on track,” the mayor said.

“We’d like to avoid those in this administration. But, the truth is, we’re probably gonna have to look at those as well given the magnitude of the challenge that we’re facing — not only to make sure that we’re steady for 2020 but looking to 2021 and beyond.”

Lightfoot said increasing property taxes is “always the last choice,” even though it is the most reliable source of revenue. But it is “particularly the last choice in this environment, when people are really, really suffering” and unemployment has risen to levels not seen since the Great Depression.

“The number of landlords that are worried about foreclosure. The number of renters that are worried about being able to make the rent. If we raise property taxes, that has a cascading effect on the ecosystem — on landlords and renters at a time when neither can afford it,” she said.

With property taxes off the table, where will Lightfoot turn for revenue?

She would only say, “The reality is that, when you have to have revenue, it’s going to impact someone — and probably someones plural. But we’re looking at efficiencies that we save internally first. I still believe that you can’t go out and talk to the taxpayers about sacrifice if you’re not making commonsense sacrifices within city government.”

For weeks after the stay-at-home shutdown, Lightfoot said Chicago was well-positioned to weather the storm of increased costs and declining revenues tied to the coronavirus pandemic without blowing a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget.

She repeatedly said “no one revenue stream is more than 13%” and that all of the “economically sensitive” revenues together total just 25%.

Her claims about city finances ignored the fact that when the stock market drops and city pension funds don’t meet their expected investment returns, Chicago taxpayers make up the difference.

The mayor even ridiculed former mayoral challenger Paul Vallas for writing an opinion column claiming Chicago was “facing a code-red fiscal crisis” and Lightfoot’s “claim that Chicago’s budget is in good shape strains credulity.”

In a stinging public put-down, Lightfoot referred to Vallas as “desperate to be relevant” during the crisis and said he “probably hasn’t touched a city budget, doesn’t know the nuances, in probably two decades.”

Vallas served as city revenue director, budget director and Chicago Public Schools CEO under former Mayor Richard M. Daley.

On April 7, the mayor changed her tune and acknowledged the possibility of a midyear budget fix.

On Friday, she again refused to project the size of Chicago’s budget shortfall, saying the situation was still “unbelievably fluid” and an initial estimate would end up too low and need to be revised upward at a time when laid-off Chicagoans are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.

“A lot of it depends on when we reopen, who reopens, what the revenue stream is from the businesses that do reopen. This is not simple math. It’s very, very complicated and it’s fluid. We want to put something out that we can stand behind,” she said.

“I’m a cautious person. I want to make sure we understand the full magnitude of the challenge. Has there been an impact? Of course there has been. Has it been significant? Yes. What that looks like precisely, we still need to look at some other data that just hasn’t come in yet.”

Lightfoot said a “big, important, determining factor” in the need to raise local taxes will be what, if any, revenue replacement relief comes from Congress in the next round of stimulus money.

She noted the Federal Reserve has also “opened up potential borrowing for municipalities” like Chicago, and she is “still working with them to understand what that possibility would look like” while maintaining dialogue with Wall Street ratings agencies.",real

And even that channel isn’t available to everyone.

Pakistan already struggles to keep millions of children in school, and as partial shutdowns continue, educators warn enrollments could drop further. Some private-school students were given study plans and extra coursework, but most Pakistani children — those who attend public government schools — were sent home with no further guidance.

“They said, ‘Keep them busy,’ but they didn’t provide us an outline to study, anything,” said Kainat Nisar, a 24-year-old university student who suddenly found herself in charge of the education of five nieces and nephews between the ages of 4 and 14.

The children watch the government channel for their allotted hour, but Nisar, as one of the most educated people in her family, is left to keep everyone engaged for the rest of the day. A typical day has the younger children outside on the roof hunched over workbooks while the older children share use of the family’s only laptop in a back room.





""You are teaching your children on your own; you're on your own,"" she said.

Pakistan has some of the world’s worst education indicators. More than 40 percent of Pakistan’s school-age students don’t attend school, the second-highest rate in the world. And even for those who do attend school, literacy rates suggest many are not learning. Fewer than 20 percent of Pakistani third-graders can read and comprehend a short passage.

Now, educators, experts and officials fear the months-long closure of schools in Pakistan with minimal distance learning is set to exacerbate the problem.

The national Pakistani curriculum is taught in Urdu and English — the country’s official languages. But most Pakistani children grow up speaking a regional language at home and struggle to absorb information in the classroom. Lessons largely consist of rote memorization with teachers reciting the content of textbooks to classes of 30 to 40 children. The students chant back what the teachers just said.





""It's almost like we think kids are USB sticks, and we are just downloading this information onto them and that will make them educated,"" said Nadia Naviwala, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and an expert on the Pakistani education system. She warns Pakistan's education crisis is preventing the country from advancing economically and undercuts efforts to battle extremism.

These larger problems in Pakistan's education system, Naviwala says, are reflected in the government television channel created during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Teleschool channel is uneven in its quality. Some programming is incomprehensible and fast-paced, while other broadcasts are better than the content children get in the government school system, according to education experts.



In one recently broadcast English lesson for kindergartners about the letter “u,” a young female voice narrates an animated story about a village of huts destroyed by a mudslide after a greedy man cut down all the trees. As the story is told, the words “hut,” “mud” and “cut” flashed on the screen.



But during another broadcast, a second-grade science lesson on the eyesight of owls delved into how unique proteins in the birds’ eyes sense different light wavelengths, subject matter far beyond the comprehension level of a second-grader.

Pakistan’s education minister, Shafqat Mahmood, acknowledges problems with the content. “We know it’s not perfect,” he said, but he explained his ministry was left scrambling after the shutdown was announced. The country had never had an educational television channel before, and because of the low rates of Internet access in the country, setting up online lessons with video conferencing and interactive lectures would have been impossible. About 36 percent of Pakistani households have broadband Internet access, according to government figures, and according to the World Bank 15.5 percent of the population used the Internet in 2016.

“We believe it has been very successful,” Mahmood said of the Teleschool channel. He said the feedback he has seen from parents and teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. But, he said, “it doesn’t replace the classroom.”





Mahmood also acknowledged that the channel wasn’t reaching Pakistan’s poorest families and said his ministry is trying to develop educational radio programing.

Pakistan’s schools will be closed through the rest of the school year, officials announced this week, despite the easing of other lockdown restrictions. Coronavirus infections, meanwhile, are steadily increasing. As of Monday, the Health Ministry had recorded nearly 42,000 infections. More than 900 had died.

Imtiaz Ahmed, a headmaster at a school in Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said hardly any of her students have been able to see the program. Like most government school students in Pakistan, the children at Ahmed’s school are mostly from poor families of farmers or day laborers, and they cannot afford a television set.

Once schools reopen, Ahmed said, it will take months to bring students back to the level they were at when the lockdown began. And she said she expects fewer students to return as more families put their children to work for additional income.





Partial coronavirus lockdowns in Pakistan have put millions out of work and are estimated to have pushed up to 10 million Pakistanis into poverty, according to government estimates.

Saima Ali, a middle-class housewife, said her family’s finances have taken a hit from the lockdown. Ali went to government schools as a child but insists on sending her children to private schools, where she believes they receive a better education.

“It’s expensive, it’s a lot for us, but we must by hook or by crook,” she said of scraping together the fee payments.

“We have a saying in Urdu: The most important wealth you are giving to your children is education.”

Photos show what it's like in the world's latest coronavirus hotspot.,"With more than 13,000 deaths and over 190,000 confirmed cases, Brazil is emerging as the world's new coronavirus hotspot.

While the first infections were spotted in the richer neighborhoods of large cities, the virus has since been spreading rampantly in the country's favelas.

But as hospitals and morgues in the country are becoming overwhelmed, its president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to downplay the threat of the virus, dismissing it as a ""little flu.""

While anti-lockdown protests have emerged, others have been very critical of the Brazilian president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, staging protests and voicing outrage on social media.

Despite the growing coronavirus cases, Brazil is currently not under a nation-wide lockdown. But some individual state governors have gone against Bolsonaro's orders and imposed their own measures.

With the sixth-worst death toll in the world, Brazil has emerged as the new coronavirus hotspot.

Brazil's hospitals, morgues, and cemeteries has been grappling with a rising number of coronavirus cases, which were first brought into the country by people traveling back from Europe and the US in February.

But despite growing concern that the country will record thousands of more deaths from the virus, its president — Jair Bolosnaro — never imposed a nation-wide lockdown.

Bolsonaro continues to downplay the threat of the virus, attending anti-lockdown protests and starting feuds with state governors, who have gone against his orders by individually issuing partial lockdowns.

1445,1308,https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2020/05/18/coronavirus-stricken-airlines-park-aircraft-arizona-southwest/5213346002/,2020-05-18,Grounded in Arizona: Flights arrive but don't leave as ailing airlines park fleets,"A week ago Friday, 10 Delta Airlines jetliners flew into a remote desert airstrip between Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. Not one flew out.

So far this past week, planes owned by Avianca Ecuador, Air Canada and its regional carrier Jazz Aviation, and a contract carrier from Bangor, Maine, have arrived at Pinal Air Park near Marana.

They carried no passengers and only a skeleton crew, usually just a pilot and a first officer, and those planes, too, never left, reports The Arizona Republic, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.

In the last 10 days more than 50 jetliners have filed final flight plans to the converted World War II training base.

They are part of a wave of ghost flights landing at an unprecedented rate at desert airstrips all over the Southwest near places like Marana and Kingman in Arizona, Mojave and Victorville in California, Roswell, New Mexico, and Abilene, Texas.

The planes will sit in storage at the airstrips as airlines deal with the economic shocks of the COVID-19 crisis. Since Feb. 20, airline passenger traffic is down an estimated 95%, and industry stocks have lost two-thirds of their value.

Rather than flying empty planes, most airlines are parking significant portions of their fleets, which even for a short term involves an intricate maintenance schedule to make sure the planes are airworthy if and when they are needed again.

'A sense of sadness'

One pilot, a seasoned veteran with a major airline, flew into Pinal Air Park in a jet with just one other person on board, a first officer.

""It's a little eerie,"" he said.

Taking off was a different experience as well because the plane was extremely light with no passengers or baggage

The pilot spoke on the condition of anonymity because his company had not authorized him to talk with the media.

The scene at the air park was surreal, he said. The facility has no air traffic control tower, a fairly short runway and no landing lights or visual approach indicators. But what really stood out is the massive number of aircraft parked there.

""You get this sense of impressiveness because you see so many planes from all over the world way out where nobody would ever think of going,"" he said.

""At the same time there's a profound sense of sadness that goes along with it because you know why they're there, and it sort of hits you that this plane you're flying is not going to be flying again, maybe forever, but certainly not for a long time,"" the pilot said. ""You know this is affecting people's lives, and that definitely hits you a bit. ""

Airlines mothball more planes

Most airlines routinely retire aircraft and place them in storage, but the pace has been dramatically accelerated because of the pandemic.

According to Airlines for America, an industry lobbying organization, U.S. air carriers have idled nearly 3,200 planes in recent months, about 52% of the nation's active fleet.

Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport public information officer Greg Roybal said that as of Wednesday, five airlines had parked a total of 39 planes indefinitely at the airport, but said the situation remains fluid.

Elsewhere, American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier in terms of fleet size, has parked 54 planes on an unused runway at Tulsa International Airport and has also idled planes at airports in Pittsburgh and Mobile, Alabama, according to published reports.It is also storing aircraft at Roswell Air Center, in New Mexico, which, like Marana Air Park, is a converted World War II military facility.

Delta, the largest American airline in terms of revenue and the third-largest in terms of fleet size, is mothballing 600 planes, about half its fleet, during the crisis, said corporate spokeswoman Maria Moraitakis.

The airline had already planned to retire 76 older MD-88 and MD-90 aircraft at the end of the year, but moved up plans and will phase out all of them by June, Moraitakis said.

At least 50 Delta planes have been parked at Marana, which, like other desert operations, provides an ideal climate for storing planes because the low humidity helps prevent corrosion.

Storage areas are filling up

Scott Butler, chief commercial officer of Ascent Aviation Services, which operates the Pinal Air Park runway and storage operations, said in an e-mail interview that companies have placed about 250 planes in storage there since March, bringing the Marana operation to about 85% of its capacity.

He said the facility has received planes from 15 countries and five continents in the last several months.

The Marana facility primarily handles larger planes and wide-body jets. A smaller facility in Tucson handles smaller and intermediate jets typically used by regional carriers. That facility is at roughly 60% of capacity, Butler said.

Before the COVID-19 crisis, the company was operating at about 30% of capacity, and the increased activity has led the company to increase its workforce by about 125 full-time equivalents.

Butler said most airlines are placing aircraft in what he called “short-term storage,” which, depending on specifications by different aircraft manufacturers, typically means from 30 to 90 days, though some are retiring aircraft for good, which involves an extensive decommissioning process.

Ascent Aviation spokeswoman Annette Feasel said the process of storing an aircraft is complex.

""Each aircraft manufacturer has different guidelines,"" she said, depending on whether it's an ""active parking situation or short or long-term storage.""

More complex than parking a car

Active parking may mean the company has to start the engines every seven to 10 days and fire up other systems to ensure they are working so the plane remains airworthy.

Short- or long-term storage entails more extensive operations, possibly including the removal of engines. Typically, the longer planes have been in storage, the longer it takes to reactivate them.

She added that airplanes are ""built to be in the air and they don't like to be on the ground. The longer they're on the ground and they're in various weather and different types of conditions, it's detrimental to the aircraft.""

""When you think about your automobile, you do have to change the oil and do a few things, but if your car sits for a week or two, and nothing happens, you're still going to be in fairly good shape,"" Feasel said. ""An airplane needs a lot more than that.""

She said with nearly 400 planes on the property, operations are going on constantly. The people who maintain the planes are just as important as the people who fly them, but get little recognition.

""In order to maintain airworthiness there's a lot of tasks that have to happen every day, and the people who are doing that, they deserve to be acknowledged,"" she said.

1457,671,https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/5/7/21250978/coronavirus-restaurants-outdoor-rooftop-patios-extended-hours-midnight-chicago-city-council,2020-05-07,Chicago restaurants’ outdoor patios and rooftop gardens can stay open until midnight — when they reopen,"Whenever the stay-at-home shutdown is lifted in Chicago, restaurants and bars with outdoor patios and sidewalk cafes are likely to open first and be the most popular with people eager to let loose, but safely.

At a virtual meeting Thursday, the City Council’s License Committee turned its attention to those establishments.

At the behest of Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), the License Committee agreed to let downtown Chicago’s outdoor patios and rooftop gardens stay open until midnight this spring, summer and fall — if they’re lucky enough to come back at all.

For years, Reilly has sought that extra hour to accommodate international travelers who love to stay out late. International travel is virtually non-existent and likely to remain a sliver of what it was until there’s a coronavirus vaccine.

But rooftop garden and outdoor patio business is poised for a comeback, as soon as the shackles are lifted, making that extra hour of business all the more important.

“This is an annual exercise. I’m asking members to once again extend these hours to the hospitality industry — assuming that they are back in business in time to use their patios this year. Assuming that folks will eventually be back to work,” Reilly said.

“This is one more way we can support an industry that is struggling terribly right now with the stay-at-home order and all of the measures we are taking to protect public health. … We also need to provide these businesses the ability to make some extra revenue by adding that extra hour during warm weather months.”

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia called the ordinance “a solid move” for a struggling industry and predicted big crowds for outdoor patios and rooftop gardens.

“You can exercise social distancing. They just would be more comfortable out in fresh air than outside,” Toia said.

Downtown Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) said he, too, supports the extra hour. But like Reilly, Hopkins wants to maintain the annual review to keep noise under control at places like the hotel in his ward that’s “surrounded on all sides by residential condo towers.”

“Bars and restaurants that have patios, that have outdoor spaces, that have cafes and rooftops — they’re going to be doing more business than bars and restaurants that don’t have outdoor spaces because people are just gonna feel more comfortable. It’s generally safer in an outdoor environment right now with an airborne virus still lurking out there,” Hopkins said.

“Given that, we can anticipate bigger crowds on rooftops, which means more noise. We want them to open. We want them to make money. We want the servers to return to their jobs. But that doesn’t mean we can stop trying to keep some peace so the neighbors don’t complain.”

Noise control was also the driving force behind another Hopkins-championed ordinance approved by the License Committee.

For bars and restaurants violating the ban on live or amplified music at outdoor patios and rooftop gardens, the minimum fine would be increased to $400, though the never-imposed maximum would drop to $1,000 from $5,000.

“I had some patios that were getting such a crowd for their outdoor facility with music, they treated the fines as just a cost of doing business. They had such a good thing going, they said, ‘We’ll just keep violating it and paying the fines.’ I had to do something to increase the incentive to not break the rules,” Hopkins said.

“If you’re outside, the chances are much lower that you’re gonna be exposed to the virus. ... In recognition of that, bars are gonna want to market their outdoor spaces — and that’s fine. There’s no reason why they can’t have crowds returning to their patios and rooftops and still be good neighbors.”

The License Committee also approved a Reilly-championed ordinance prohibiting peddling in parts of River North, the Gold Coast and Near North neighborhoods.

Reilly said the ordinance addresses “some chronic issues we’ve had on very specific blocks and streets. ....It’s not a blanket prohibition for the ward. It’s just a handful of corridors.”",real
1461,893,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-new-york-city-lives-affected/,2020-05-14,View from the front lines: The lives impacted by coronavirus in New York City,"CBS News spent seven days at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx section of New York City, from April 16-22. It was the height of the coronavirus pandemic in one of the hardest-hit communities in the nation. Watch the CBS News special, ""Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line"" Friday, May 15, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CBS, re-airing Saturday and Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on CBSN.

By mid-April, the coronavirus had killed more people in New York than anywhere else, and of the city's five boroughs, the Bronx was the hardest hit. Very few journalists had spent time in hospitals on the front lines, and I had just signed up for seven days and nights inside a COVID-stricken hospital to document what the health care workers on the front lines were experiencing.

I was not just making a decision about putting my own health at risk. I was making a decision for my wife and two young children, too. My wife and I talked it through. A lot. And she saw it clearly: ""This is your job. To go and tell their stories, accepting the risk just like they do.""

""Bodies keep piling up""

Chris Feliciano, a paramedic in New York City. Andrew Bast

Before dawn on Day 2, I drove out to Fort Totten in Queens where EMS crews of the New York City Fire Department assemble first thing in the morning, preparing to fan out across the city and respond to emergency calls. That's where I met Chris Feliciano, a paramedic who had recovered from coronavirus himself and was now back to work.

""This is worse than 9/11,"" Feliciano told me. ""I say that because 9/11 was just one day and unfortunately over 3,000 people died in that one day but we're seeing numbers well above that and this is continuous. This is not just one day, this is daily and the bodies keep piling up.""

The calls never stopped. Within 10 minutes of treating one patient the ambulance lights would flash, the siren would blare, and we would be racing again through the streets of the Bronx.

Shortness of breath was the most common symptom from patients. They were scared and said as much. And they faced a grim reality: going to the hospital could be more dangerous than trying to recover at home.

""Because the hospitals are so overwhelmed, it's a mass casualty incident at the moment with the city,"" Feliciano said. ""We would generally get cardiac arrests about once or twice a week. But now it's just happening at all hours of the day.""

At a small row house later that morning, we arrived too late for the elderly man inside. He was pronounced ""D.O.A.""—dead on arrival.

The volume of calls forced FDNY to put a new protocol in place. ""We will try for 20 minutes to resuscitate a patient,"" Feliciano said. ""If there's no response to our interventions, we would have to pronounce on scene.""

""Like a buffalo on my chest""

Cristian Camas Gilad Thaler

Overwhelmed with patients, Montefiore Medical Center, the largest hospital in the Bronx, transformed a giant meeting hall into a COVID-19 ward. The moment I walked in for the first time, a young doctor said to me, ""There's a 22-year-old ambulance worker here, you should talk with him.""

In one of the dozens of makeshift rooms, I pulled back the curtain and found Cristian Camas. He lay on his hospital bed, working hard to breathe. A rosary hung on the bedside railing. Sweat beaded down his forehead. ""It was like a buffalo was on my chest,"" he kept saying, describing how the disease had overcome him. Telling his story, he echoed a haunting refrain he repeated again and again: ""I didn't think I was going to make it.""

Camas worked for a private ambulance company and likely contracted the virus while helping to save the lives of others.

We FaceTimed with Cristian's father who lived in the South Bronx. Despite everything that was happening, he invited me to their home.

Cristian's mother explained that an uncle had recently died. Cristian's 13-year-old brother Erik was worried about the rest of the family.

""There was a moment here where I was by myself, because my mom, she started feeling sick, too,"" said Erik, Cristian's 13-year-old brother. ""I imagine myself without any of them, and I knew that I couldn't do anything without them. It was horrible.""

Before a table bearing a bible and a candle, Erik led the family in prayer, asking God for Cristian to come home safely.

Three days later, his prayers were answered. Cristian was one of the 314 patients discharged from the hospital over the week we were there.

One more night shift

Dr. Michelle Gong Gilad Thaler

The last night of shooting was a Wednesday near the end of April. It was chilly and clear out. I went into the hospital to follow Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of critical care, for one more night shift.

I geared up—full-body Tyvek suit, surgical gloves, N95 covered with a surgical mask, full-face plastic shield—and it took less than 10 minutes for a ""code"" to come. It was an urgent call for rapid response to a patient in distress.

A team of doctors swarmed a crashing patient, more human bodies in a single patient's room than I imagined was possible. Nurses scrambled for supplies, wrappers and plastic gloves flipped into the air, left scattered on the hospital floor like emergency detritus. I sweat through my PPE as I shot video of Dr. Gong as she climbed onto the bed so she could push down on the patient's chest, a procedure to determine if his body could handle being turned over. They got the patient to the ICU.

What fear looks like

Andrew Bast Gilad Thaler

In the week we spent at the hospital, COVID took the lives of 70 people.

For seven days, I'd been pointing a camera at countless medical professionals as they raced to save lives, strained to protect themselves from the virus. As they laughed and celebrated small victories, as they broke down and wept over endless death that had overwhelmed their lives.

What I didn't know was that, for just a moment, a colleague snapped a photo of me at work. In all my time at Montefiore, I never thought I felt afraid.

Then I saw the image. It's undeniable what filled my eyes: a new kind of fear.

The country, an epicenter of the pandemic, plans to be mostly reopened within the next few weeks, with strict health guidelines.

The Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day.

Certain travel may still be limited based on disease risks, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders.

The travel ban lifts the day after Italy's Republic Day, likely preventing mass travel over a long holiday weekend.

Italy's infection rate has fallen sharply in recent days. Despite calls for a quicker reopening, Conte said a gradual return to normalcy can help prevent a second wave of infections, Reuters reports.

Some shops in Italy start to reopen amid pandemic

According to the decree, all sectors of the economy still shuttered can reopen in June, as long as proper safety guidelines, social distancing and hygiene rules are adhered to. Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections.

The country maintained strict lockdown guidelines until May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen. Shops plan to open May 18, and that same day, people will be able to move freely within their region.

Before coronavirus truly took hold in the United States, Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world. It was the first European country to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions and has struggled for months to limit the virus' spread.

Italy currently has the fifth-highest number of confirmed infections globally with over 233,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. It has the third-highest death toll, behind the U.S. and the U.K., with over 31,000 confirmed deaths.",real

Already almost 4 million homeowners were on forbearance plans as of May 3, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act — or CARES Act — provides borrowers with home loans the right to request a temporary suspension of payments on federally backed mortgages.

Forbearance is a temporary fix but it may be worth exploring in order to avoid a foreclosure down the road.

In March, lenders might have initially offered to let homeowners who made such requests to postpone 90 days of mortgage payments through a forbearance agreement. Many of those agreements, though, would likely expire come late June or July.

The debt isn't forgiven and the regular interest keeps building. No additional fees can be charged.

“Forbearance is really a deferral. They will still need to make these payments,” said Kathleen L. Kraninger, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in phone call Friday morning.

Some early requests triggered a great deal of confusion and frustration, though, when some homeowners were told by some mortgage servicers that they'd be required to repay the money in a lump sum when the three months were up.

But that's not your only option.

A new Consumer Relief Guide, which spells out the relief process associated with federally backed mortgages, was released Friday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. The guide outlines the rights to mortgage payment forbearance and foreclosure protection under the federal CARES Act.

See www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus for information on how to protect your finances during the coronavirus pandemic.

Such relief is essential as 36.5 million workers across the country have applied for unemployment benefits in the past eight weeks.

Much of the U.S. economy has been put on pause in an attempt to save lives during the coronavirus crisis. In the coming weeks, parts of the economy are expected to gradually reopen. Some workers may return to their jobs soon; others won't.

John W. Ryan, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, said borrowers are telling state regulators that they're confused about mortgage relief, and in some cases, getting inconsistent information about forbearance.

Consumers have a right to get up to 180 days of forbearance initially, and then request an extension for up to another 180 days of payment relief.

The consumer relief guide gives a summary of borrowers’ rights under the CARES Act, steps to access mortgage relief and repayment options.

Many lenders and servicers are providing forbearance benefits regardless of federally backed status, according to the Consumer Relief Guide.

Kraninger said the CFPB is working hand-in hand with other federal and state regulators to protect consumers during this national emergency.

The guide notes:

Homeowners have the right to obtain a 180-day pause in paying your mortgage or temporarily lower mortgage payments if you are a borrower on a federally backed mortgage loan and affirm that you are experiencing a financial hardship due directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 emergency.

Your mortgage servicer — or company where you send payments to each month — can tell you if your loan is federally backed.

While in forbearance, you can still choose to make partial payments, which will reduce the amount you would need to repay in the future.

In most cases, you should receive multiple options for repaying the monthly payments that were not made during the forbearance period.

Foreclosure actions on loans federally backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD, which includes single family FHA loans and reverse mortgage HECM loans, are frozen until June 30, 2020.

Loan types that are federally backed include: Conventional loans purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour event for students graduating from historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were unexpectedly political, given the venue, and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.

“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”

Later Saturday, during a second televised commencement address for high school seniors, Obama panned “so-called grown-ups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs” who do “what feels good, what’s convenient, what’s easy.”

“Which is why things are so screwed up,” he said.

Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials in either of his appearances. But earlier this month, he harshly criticized Trump’s handling of the pandemic as an “absolute chaotic disaster” in a call with 3,000 members of his administrations obtained by Yahoo News.

The commencement remarks were the latest sign that Obama intends to play an increasingly active role in the coming election. He has generally kept a low profile in the years since he left office, even as Trump has disparaged him. Obama told supporters on the call that he would be “spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can” for Joe Biden, who served as his vice president.

As he congratulated the college graduates Saturday and commiserated over the enormous challenges they face given the devastation and economic turmoil the virus has wrought, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.

“Let’s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,” Obama said. “We see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn’t submit to their questioning.”

“Injustice like this isn’t new,” Obama went on to say. “What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing, that the old ways of doing things don’t work.” In the face of a void in leadership, he said, it would be up to the graduates to shape the future.

“If the world’s going to get better, it’s going to be up to you,” he said.

It is a perilous time for the nation’s historically black colleges and universities, which have long struggled with less funding and smaller endowments than their predominantly white peers and are now dealing with the financial challenges of the coronavirus. Even at the better-endowed HBCUs, officials are bracing for a tough few years.

Obama’s message to high school students came at the end of an hourlong television special featuring celebrities, including LeBron James, Yara Shahidi and Ben Platt, and was less sharp-edged than his speech to the college graduates. He urged the young graduates to be unafraid despite the current challenges facing the nation and to strive to be part of a diverse community.

“Leave behind all the old ways of thinking that divide us — sexism, racial prejudice, status, greed — and set the world on a different path,” Obama said.",real

Scientists Believe Signs of ‘Human Intervention’ are in Coronavirus Strain Cultured to Attack Human Cells

These are the findings of an Austrian study.

By: Big League Politics, May 19, 2020:

An Austrian study conducted by vaccine researcher Nikolai Petrovsky has indicated that SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19, contains a “sign of human intervention.”

Petrovsky, who does research for Flinders University in Austria, has come to the conclusion that the virus was optimized to penetrate human cells rather than animal cells. Barring some “remarkable coincidence,” Petrovsky believes this means the virus was engineered to attack humans.

Lifesite News, who broke the story, reported that the scientists “used a version of the novel coronavirus collected in the earliest days of the outbreak and applied computer models to test its capacity to bind to certain cell receptor enzymes, called “ACE2,” that allow the virus to infect human and animal cells to varying degrees of efficacy.”

Scientists discovered that “the novel coronavirus most powerfully binds with human ACE2, and with variously lesser degrees of effectiveness with animal versions of the receptor.” They believe this means SARS-CoV-2 “became specialized for human cell penetration by living previously in human cells, quite possibly in a laboratory.”

The study explains its conclusions by stating that “a virus would be expected to have highest affinity for the receptor in its original host species, e.g. bat, with a lower initial binding affinity for the receptor of any new host, e.g. humans. However, in this case, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 is higher for humans than for the putative original host species, bats, or for any potential intermediary host species.”

The study notes a “possibility which still cannot be excluded is that SARSCoV-2 was created by a recombination event that occurred inadvertently or consciously in a laboratory handling coronaviruses, with the new virus then accidentally released into the local human population.”

Petrovsky believes the virus was cultured to evolve over time, meaning that this could have been many years in the making.

“Our and other analyses of the genomic sequence of the virus do not reveal any artificial gene inserts that would be the hallmark of a gene jockey, genetic engineers who manipulate or even create viruses by splicing in artificial inserts into their genome.” Petrovsky said.

Big League Politics has noted that even the mainstream experts admit that the age of bioweapon is at hand and individuals should be very concerned with the possibility of these being set off:",fake
1493,321,https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/4/14/21220993/coronavirus-smokestack-demolition-permit-air-pollution-little-village,2020-04-14,Lightfoot’s decision to strip aldermen of control over permits at center of Little Village demolition controversy,"Hours after taking office, Mayor Lori Lightfoot signed an executive order stripping aldermen of their unbridled control over licensing and permitting in their wards.

On Saturday, the mayor’s decision to start delivering on the central promise of her corruption-fighting mayoral campaign came back to haunt the residents of Little Village, several aldermen now say.

Armed with a city demolition permit that local Ald. Mike Rodriguez (22nd) said he was powerless to block, a subcontractor hired by Hilco Redevelopment Partners demolished a 95-year-old smokestack at the site of a shuttered coal-fired power plant without abiding by the safety measures it had promised to implement.

That caused a giant plume of dust to rain down on the area, potentially creating a public health hazard in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Homes, vehicles, streets and sidewalks were left filthy.

On Tuesday, Rodriguez said he would have delayed the smokestack demolition if he could have and twice tried to do just that, only to be told by the city the project would proceed.

He now plans to introduce an ordinance requiring so-called “special-use permits” from the Zoning Board of Appeals before future large-scale demolitions.

“In that special-use permit, there will be much more strict guidelines and much more community engagement and aldermanic power,” said Rodriguez, who lives five blocks from the demolition site. “I ran a non-profit organization for eight years. We were about organizing community members to take power. That’s what we need to empower here.”

Aldermen Brian Hopkins (2nd) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) couldn’t agree more.

They argue that Lightfoot’s decision to consolidate permitting power in the mayor’s office means she “owns” the Little Village debacle as much as she said Hilco does.

Hopkins noted that during his first-term as alderman, he presided over “one of the most extensive demolition projects” in Chicago’s history — on the site of the Lincoln Yards project. That demolition included: Finkl Steel; a 100,000 square-foot fleet maintenance facility with more than 20 underground storage tanks filled with hazardous chemicals; a rubber recycling company; a tannery, and a variety of other large industrial structures.

“I was consulted every step of the way. Involved in the decision-making process. The dust mitigation, the environmental remediation, scheduling it at a time when it would be less disruptive to the neighborhood,” Hopkins said Tuesday. “Contrast that with the way the city handled aldermanic involvement in this. Alderman Rodriguez was merely notified at the last minute. He wasn’t told he had veto authority. He wasn’t asked for permission. He was simply informed this was happening. It’s the exact opposite of what I went through.”

When Chicago finally returns to some semblance of normality, Hopkins said, he hopes aldermen will take back their permitting powers.

“An alderman knows that he [or she] will be held responsible for negative consequences of any decision like this. So an alderman is going to approach it much more cautiously. ... We use our aldermanic authority to protect neighborhoods. That’s been taken away from us,” Hopkins said.

“When the COVID-19 crisis subsides and there’s no longer such extreme justification for mayoral authority to be solely concentrated in the hands of one person, we should go back to the way it’s always been in Chicago, where the people who are elected by and accountable to the neighbors are making decisions.”

Sigcho-Lopez argued Lightfoot’s decision to “centralize power” has had “unfortunate and shameful consequences” in Little Village. The same could happen with a concrete plant he opposes in his own ward.

“She can try to point fingers all she wants. But at the end of the day, the departments issued the permit in the first place. She has to own this as much as Hilco owns this,” Sigcho-Lopez said.

The mayor’s office advised Hopkins and Sigcho-Lopez to “re-orient themselves with the facts” before trying to “politicize” the Little Village controversy.

In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Lightfoot’s administration noted “nothing about the building code was changed” by the mayor’s executive order, nor did it “change any demolition practices at the Department of Buildings.” In fact, the Municipal Code “still requires that aldermen receive a 10-day notice period, which allows them to raise any concerns about potentially permitted activity,” the statement said.

The mayor’s office noted: work on the Little Village site began two years before Lightfoot took office; Hopkins was “among the 41 aldermen who supported” Hilco’s warehouse project; and Sigcho Lopez campaigned on “his support of repealing aldermanic prerogative.”

The statement further noted Rodriguez was “heavily involved with the developer, including the CEO of the company, as well as other city departments multiple times” before Saturday’s demolition.

It concluded: “It is simply shameful for politicians like Aldermen Hopkins and Sigcho-Lopez to pontificate about a tragic incident in which people were traumatized all to try to score cheap political points. Their uninformed statements speak volumes about their character and their shameless quest for recognition at someone else’s expense.”",real

In Dagestan, more than 40 doctors died from community-acquired pneumonia and coronavirus infection, the head of the Republican Ministry of Health, Jamaludin Hajiyibragimov said.

When asked why the names of the dead doctors were not published on the official website of the Ministry of Health, the official replied that he did not separate his colleagues from other victims of the coronavirus infection in the republic.

According to the official, more than 13,000 people suffer from pneumonia and COVID-19 in Dagestan. As many as 7,000 of those people are hospitalized.

As the minister specified, on May 16, 29 people died from COVID-19 in Dagestan, while 657 people died from community-acquired pneumonia.

Hajiyibragimov also said that families of medical employees, who died on duty, would receive a financial compensation in the amount of 2.7 million rubles, while hospital personnel, whose health deteriorated as a result of their work, would receive compensations from 688,000 to 2 million rubles.

Most recent coronavirus stats for Russia are as follows:

the total number of cases is 272 043 people

2537 died from the disease

63 166 recovered.

Meanwhile, former mixed martial athlete (MMA), Magomedkhan Gamzatkhanov spoke about the situation with the spread of the coronavirus infection in Dagestan. According to the former athlete, the authorities of the republic could not convince the people of the dangers of COVID-19.

“We have a catastrophic situation ÑÑÐºÑ in Dagestan. Ninety people were taken to the central hospital yesterday. A lot of people die. It has become better now, but a lot of people are still sick,” Gamzatkhanov, one of the pioneers of MMA in Russia told Sport Express.

Gamzatkhanov believes that the coronavirus hit Dagestan so hard because the region is being governed from Moscow, rather than locally.

""To understand what a Dagestani is, one needs to be one. The governor of the Tula region says that one needs to stay home, and everyone does. In Dagestan, the situation is different. People don’t believe the local authorities. A lot of people bought into those rumors from social networks that said that the disease was not dangerous. People continued going to wedding parties, to other events, infecting everyone around. Now they have realized how serious the crisis has become for them. They stay home, and the situation is improving,” Gamzatkhanov said.



In Dagestan, there are 3,280 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. Officially, 29 people died from the novel virus in the republic; from community-acquired pneumonia - 657 people. In addition, more than 40 doctors have died in Dagestan.

According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, such a large number of positive cases and deaths in the republic of Dagestan have appeared due to self-treatment attempts. In addition, people ask for medical help too late.",fake

This claim is scientifically untrue.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

Example of the claims can be seen here and here and here .

Most claims refer to a version of a now-deleted, widely shared YouTube video of Dr Andrew Kaufman, a “natural healing consultant” ( here ) in an interview with Spiro Skouras, an online-personality and “independent researcher” with a popular YouTube channel.

In the video, Kaufman talks about how a future COVID-19 vaccine would provide a vessel to “inject genes” into humans, first by a procedure known as “electroporation”, in which an electric current “create[s] little holes in our cells that allow the DNA to go into our own cells” and then through the insertion of “foreign proteins that supposedly generate immunity”. Kaufman concludes that the vaccine, like the results of biotechnology in agriculture, will make humans “genetically modified organisms”.

There are multiple claims in the nearly one hour-long video, which are beyond the scope of this fact check. However, the main claim in these posts on social media that a COVID-19 vaccine will genetically modify humans (described in the headline of the video and by Kaufman) is false. While most headlines don’t mention DNA-based vaccines, Dr Kaufman talks about them in the video.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a DNA vaccine “involves the direct introduction into appropriate tissues of a plasmid containing the DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought, and relies on the in situ production of the target antigen.” ( here )

This means that, in contrast to the more widespread “conventional” vaccines ( here ) which use a whole pathogen or fragment, a DNA vaccine involves the injection of a small part of the virus’s genetic code (DNA or RNA) to stimulate immune response in a patient without an infection ( here ).

This procedure does not create a genetically modified organism, which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines as “an organism in which one or more genes (called transgenes) have been introduced into its genetic material from another organism using recombinant DNA technology.” ( here )

Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University’s Alliance for Science group, debunked the idea that a DNA vaccine could genetically modify an organism. Lynas told Reuters that no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA.

“That’s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,” he said. “Genetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don’t do that. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize a pathogen when it attempts to infect the body - this is mostly done by the injection of viral antigens or weakened live viruses that stimulate an immune response through the production of antibodies.”

Lynas added: “The DNA [in DNA vaccines] does not integrate into the cell nucleus so this isn’t genetic modification - if the cells divide they will only include your natural DNA. But this approach is incredibly promising for COVID because it can be scaled up very quickly, and is very versatile - it is easy to synthetically produce DNA sequences that match the required bits of viral genetic code.”

There are many trials currently underway for a COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, with some exploring the possibility of a DNA vaccine, which may be where this false claim stems from ( here , here ).

While there are trials for a DNA vaccine for COVID-19 underway, the method does not involve changing people’s existing DNA. A future COVID-19 vaccine would not make humans “genetically modified organisms”, as the video claims.

VERDICT

False. A future COVID-19 vaccine will not genetically modify humans. DNA vaccines do not integrate the virus’ DNA into the cell nucleus of its recipient but instead inject part of the virus’ DNA/RNA into tissues to stimulate an immune response in the body.

1525,357,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/business/stock-market-live-coronavirus.html,2020-04-17,Stocks Rally After Talk of Reopening Economy,"
This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
California and Texas received the most small-business relief funds.
Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.
The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.
The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent, or about $45 billion.
Adjusting for the total amount of money that small businesses pay their employees and would be eligible to receive in loans to cover payroll, the Great Plains states emerge as big winners, with Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas receiving disproportionate shares of the money. By that metric, Nebraska did twice as well as New York.
The S.B.A. program was intended for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure benefited companies with existing relationships with banks.
S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.
Stocks jump as investors rally behind the idea of reopening the economy.
Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic.
The gains came after President Trump told governors on Thursday that they could begin reopening businesses in their states by May 1 or earlier, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.
The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential work. Boeing’s shares rose more than 14 percent on Friday.
Some European automakers — including Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler — are planning to restart assembly lines next week, staffed by workers in masks and protective clothing, sometimes separated from one another by plastic screens.
Opel, a unit of the French automaker PSA, said it would reopen its German dealerships on Monday after the German government announced that it would gradually ease lockdown restrictions.
The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.
After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the damage caused by stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. The gains on Friday mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claims.
The S&P 500 is now up more than 28 percent from its lowest point this year, which was reached on March 23. It is still nearly 18 percent below its high in late February.
On Friday, the rally came after China reported that its economy — the world’s second-largest after that of the United States — shrank for the first time in decades. And data on car sales in Europe showed they collapsed.
Some also saw hopeful signs in a report by the medical news website STAT that a drug from Gilead Sciences showed early — and, thus far, unproven — promise in fighting the coronavirus. According to STAT, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, has helped patients with severe symptoms recover rapidly in a clinical trial at a Chicago hospital. Gilead’s shares jumped nearly 10 percent.
The Trump administration plans to funnel $19 billion to farmers.President Trump said Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers that have been hurt by the fallout from coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.
The Trump administration will make $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a briefing Friday evening. It would also purchase a further $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed through food banks and other community and faith organizations to people in need, he added.
“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, that was over a period of time, and they never complained.”
Over the past year, the Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers to help offset the pain of a trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets.
More news media outlets lay off workers.
The news media industry continues to be shellacked by the dismal advertising market as businesses remain shuttered throughout much of the country. The New York Times now estimates that approximately 33,000 workers in the media industry have been affected by planned layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs, up from 28,000 last week.
The magazine company Condé Nast announced on Monday that it was cutting the pay of nearly half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The newspaper chain Advance Local — which shares a corporate parent with Condé — said this week that it would furlough employees for one to two weeks.
Digital sites, whose subscription businesses are often immature or nonexistent, continue to impose cost-savings as a way to stanch the bleeding in the ad market. Slate, which converted its membership program, Slate Plus, into a paywall last month, is cutting all employees’ pay on a sliding scale. Vox Media, which purchased New York Media last year, is furloughing roughly 10 percent of its work force and cutting the pay of high-earning employees.
The Los Angeles Times, one of the country’s largest newspapers by circulation, announced internally this week that it was furloughing 40 non-newsroom workers and cutting senior managers’ pay. It also shuttered three community weeklies, laying off 14 people, including guild members.
The ride-sharing business has collapsed.
In February, Uber said it had expected to bring in $16 billion to $17 billion in revenue this year. On Thursday, the company said it could no longer forecast what will happen.
Lyft has not yet made a similar announcement, but there’s no reason to think it faces a different fate.
Drawing from aggregated debit and credit card purchases of millions of U.S. consumers, for example, the analytics firm Second Measure found that spending on Uber’s rides dropped about 83 percent in March. And earnings tracker service Gridwise, using data collected from more than 30,000 drivers nationwide, found that the average hourly earnings of drivers dropped 36 percent from the beginning of March to the middle of the month. By the end of March, wages began to recover slightly, but were still down 24 percent.
So how are the companies dealing with the slump? For now, the strategy appears to be: Wait it out, and deliver food — as much of it as possible.
Uber’s money-losing food delivery service, Uber Eats, most likely surpassed Uber’s ride-hailing business in sales by mid-March and jumped about 27 percent for the month, according to Second Measure.
Although Lyft had no food delivery business before the pandemic, it created a temporary one to deliver meals and groceries for students and seniors. And on Wednesday, Lyft expanded the program to 11 major cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco and Seattle.
What to know about the proliferation of frauds around the coronavirus.
Frauds around the coronavirus include businesses selling intravenous vitamin C drips to “boost immunity” to the virus, websites offering masks that never arrive and even reports of fake drive-up testing sites, where impostors swabbed people’s cheeks in exchange for cash.
Here are some questions and answers about coronavirus-related fraud:How can I protect myself from coronavirus fraud?First, understand that there are currently no F.D.A.-approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, said Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner. That will, hopefully, change — but you are unlikely to hear about it first via a shady robocall. The best thing to do if you get a suspicious call is to hang up, he said.
What if I am expecting a government stimulus payment?Most people don’t have to do anything to get their economic stimulus payments, which the government is issuing to help people facing money troubles because of the virus. Those payments will be deposited into your bank account automatically, the I.R.S. said.
“The I.R.S. isn’t going to call you asking to verify or provide your financial information” so you can get your payment faster, the head of the agency, Chuck Rettig, said in a statement this month.
I saw a social media report about virus-related fraud occurring door to door. Is this true?Agencies including the F.B.I. have issued public warnings about people selling fake virus test kits and “unapproved treatments” on “door-to-door visits.” The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services also warned of “scammers” going door to door offering Covid-19 tests in exchange for personal details, like Medicare information.
European car sales plummeted in March.
New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.
New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.
Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.
Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.
German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.

The announcement came after San Francisco and its surrounding counties instituted a “shelter in place” order intended to curb the spread of the disease.

Lime may have little choice to suspend service in California after the Bay Area’s “shelter in place” order effectively bans nonessential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. But the decision to ground its scooter fleet in Washington and three European countries, places hard hit by the pandemic, is so far unprecedented in the nascent micromobility space.

Lime may have little choice to suspend service in California

“Like you, we are worried about the cities we love and call home, the people we serve, and our colleagues on the ground,” Brad Bao, CEO of Lime, said in a blog post. “Loving cities means protecting them too. For now, we’re pausing Lime service to help people stay put and stay safe.”

So far, other major scooter companies like Bird, Spin, Skip, Uber, and Lyft have yet to take similar dramatic measures. In response to a request for comment, spokespeople for those companies said they had yet to make a decision or were closely monitoring the situation.

All of the scooter companies have said they have stepped up their cleaning procedures and are advising customers to protect themselves by wearing gloves while riding.

The pandemic could be a disaster for the scooter rental business, especially coming on the heels of the winter season, which is when most companies see a large dip in ridership and revenue. In January, the company announced that it was laying off 14 percent of its workers and exiting 12 markets.

Lime, along with its rivals like Bird, Uber, and Lyft, have struggled to make scooter-sharing profitable. Most experts agree that the market is oversaturated and needs to consolidate. Lime joins Bird, Skip, Scoot, and Lyft in laying off its scooter-related employees in recent months.",real

The findings echo smaller studies of patients in New York and Europe.

Patients who took the drugs were more likely to die in the hospital, the researchers found. While that may be due in part to the likelihood that those medicines were given to patients who were sicker, the authors of the study estimated that the excess risk ranged from 34 to 45 percent.

However, the study’s authors pushed for urgent randomized, controlled trials, saying it’s not possible in an observational study to exclude the possibility that other factors were responsible for the apparent link between survival rate and these drugs.

People taking hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic appeared to have the highest increased risk of heart rhythm complications, the study found.

Chloroquine is approved for malaria, and hydroxychloroquine for autoimmune diseases like Lupus; the authors said the study does not suggest those patients should stop taking the drugs as prescribed.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization for use in coronavirus patients in late March , but has since received criticism for doing so given the scant evidence the drugs worked.

France is planning on auctioning 5G frequencies to telecoms companies at the end of the summer. However, Martin Bouygues, head of the eponymous communications firm, now thinks that bidding should be pushed back to the end of the year at the earliest.

Also on rt.com DHS & FBI fear more attacks on 5G infrastructure fueled by Covid-19 conspiracies

“We need to push back the auction date simply because the economic world today is not the same as it was early March, when the terms of the auction were set,” he told Le Figaro on Saturday, adding that holding a bidding war while France recovers “with difficulty from a terrible human health and economic health nightmare” is “not the priority of the country.”

Bouygues is not an opponent of the technology. Indeed, his firm has already secured a 50 megahertz block, as have rivals Orange, Free, and SFR.

His opposition to the auction likely stems from the fact that France is currently facing an economic recession, with growth expected to drop by eight percent this year after an extended and nationwide lockdown. As such, the return on his investment simply wouldn’t be as large as it would have been pre-pandemic.

However, Bouygues also noted that the rollout of 5G technology has come in spite of growing public mistrust.

Aside from claims that Chinese firms like Huawei could use 5G hardware to relay secrets to the government in Beijing – pushed by the Donald Trump administration in Washington and denied by Huawei and China – 5G has become a target for conspiracy theorists the world over. Fueled by some lingering uncertainties over the potential health consequences of 5G’s short wavelength transmissions, skeptics have claimed that 5G masts can trigger anything from cancer to Covid-19.

Some of the more radical among these conspiracy theorists directly blame these broadcasting masts for causing the coronavirus in the first place, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims. 5G towers erected in the Netherlands and UK have been set on fire by activists, with British protesters going as far as spitting on and attacking the telecoms engineers installing the masts.

The situation is the same outside Europe too.

Opinion contributors

As the pressure to reopen the economy intensifies, business leaders are searching for ways to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection for their workers and customers. An alluring idea is to offer testing on site, keeping those who are positive out of the workplace.

Testing seems to offer a combination of confidence building for employees and liability protection for companies. Some employers are even pursuing mandatory testing, which is permitted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

So, should universal testing in the workplace become part of the new normal?

Not yet. Given technical and resource limitations, testing is no more than one piece of the puzzle of infection prevention and control. There are three major reasons why it would be a mistake for employers to rely heavily or exclusively on testing for safety:

Social distancing vital even with tests

►Sufficient testing is difficult to put in place at even moderate scale. Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on identifying the genetic material of the virus in a sample taken from the back of the throat or the nose. (Saliva testing also is promising.) For one person at a time, with certain machines, results are possible within as little as 15 minutes. When dozens or hundreds of samples are needed, however, samples need to be run in tandem on larger machines, and the results are likely to take hours.

If you ask people to wait a day for the results, that’s another day when latent infection could manifest itself, and another test would be needed. And so on. New rapid “antigen” tests are unlikely to solve this problem, given weaknesses with their accuracy.

Pooling saliva samples from the whole workplace is a potential way to search for the coronavirus at lower cost. This strategy, however, takes additional time for sample collection and laboratory work. It also requires follow-up testing should the pooled sample prove positive.

►Negative test results do not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the workplace. The accuracy of the test depends on when it is performed in an individual’s course of infection. Many asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 infection could test negative — especially if they are in the pre-symptomatic but infectious phase. As a result, even the world’s most robust testing program would not eliminate the need for social distancing within an office or retail setting. One missed infection in someone who attends a packed staff meeting will require the whole office to quarantine.

COVID protection: Workplaces aren't ready for mass reopening. First we need standards to keep workers safe.

►Employer testing at scale could lead to shortages of testing supplies and compromise the ability of health care facilities to test people who develop symptoms. Consultants offering testing to businesses may go straight to suppliers of swabs, reagents and testing machines and outbid public health agencies and clinics. If even a fraction of workplaces attempts regular testing, the demands could far exceed capacity.

Less testing of those at greatest risk of infection will mean fewer opportunities for isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, the core components of controlling community spread. As cases in a community rise, so too will the likelihood of infections penetrating every workplace.

Sick leave, screenings and ventilation

Rather than as a magic wand, employers should look at testing as a potential piece of a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy.

Employers should provide generous sick leave and quarantine benefits, screen employees and customers for symptoms before they come to the workplace, and reengineer the work environment to maintain at least 6 feet of distance and high levels of ventilation. They should focus on ways to promote hand hygiene, social distancing, environmental disinfection, and rapid identification and contact tracing for employees who develop COVID-19.

False choice:Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.

Regular testing is most appropriate for small cohorts of people who are unable to socially distance at work and who are exposed to the public in close quarters. Indeed, such testing could prove to be of high utility in very high-risk settings, such as nursing homes. Broad testing is also important in the setting of an outbreak, as directed by public health agencies.

Testing alone, however, is insufficient as an infection prevention and control strategy. A test might find the novel coronavirus, but only careful planning, policy changes, reengineering the workplace and social distancing can stop it from spreading. There are no shortcuts to defeating COVID-19.

Her minions did it just as unemployment hits double digits, so with the job market collapsed, these newly laid off staffers can get ready for new careers as Walmart greeters and Amazon deliverymen.

They're hopping mad about it. Here's Forbes:

Laurene Powell Jobs, the majority owner of The Atlantic magazine, is worth an estimated $19.5 billion — a gain of $3.1 billion since mid-March. Despite the gain, The Atlantic, the publication in which she has a controlling stake, announced plans this week to lay off 20% of its staff, making Powell Jobs the latest billionaire to face questions about obligations to workers in the face of a ruinous pandemic. In a letter to the magazine's staff, chairman David Bradley said, ""We are informing 68 of our colleagues that we will not have a place for them on The Atlantic's new course. The contraction affects mainly our events, sales, and editorial staffs."" Bradley added that the company will freeze pay for its remaining staffers through the rest of the year, and that executives will take a pay cut. The news stirred agitation on social media, particularly within media circles. ""Laurene Powell Jobs, the billionaire majority owner of The Atlantic, is rich enough to be able to pay the salaries of all 68 laid off Atlantic staffers every year for the next 3,000 years,"" wrote Zach Schonfeld, a freelance writer and former Newsweek staffer, in one of many critical posts.

Layoffs are about par for the news industry, which is seeing horrific losses as ad revenue collapses. But for the denizens of The Atlantic, it's more bitter than for the others.

Unlike other people in the news industry, they thought they were shielded from those market forces. That's because instead of dreaded shareholders, Laurene was doing the financing herself through her lefty Emerson Collective. She drew a lot of gooey praise for it, and the Atlantic came to be viewed as a plum spot in journalism, a place where people like Anne Applebaum and David Frum and Ben Rhodes could go to write lefty columns. Here's the masthead. Laurene was there for all of them because she was sugar momma.

Here's one Atlantic Media naïf expressing that very confidence just two months ago on Glass Door:

No need to maximize quarterly growth for shareholders? This person thought Laurene Powell Jobs was the good guy and wicked shareholders were the problem. She'd protect them from dreaded market forces, see, because of all her money, and of course, because she was a lefty, which automatically made her ""compassionate."" He didn't know her very well.

Last time Powell Jobs was in the news, she had disinherited her own kids, pontificating against accumulated wealth — for other people, that is, not herself — and she was going to teach those kids that lesson. Could any employee really think he'd be treated more gently? Sink or swim — that's her only message to those around her. You're all dispensable.

Reality check for El Naivo: Laurene is the Ultimate Dreaded Shareholder, the shareholder of leftists' fevered imaginations, demanding her profit, goodwill be damned. Employees are just replaceable cogs in her mind, so easy to kick a few of them into the streets in a pandemic. She doesn't need anyone's goodwill or good opinion. Like billionaire Michael Bloomberg (estimated wealth: $60 billion), she appeared to be a sort of protection from market forces, but actually, she was quite a bit worse than the market force, which has some counterbalancing features such as the need to retain talent. Not her. And unlike Bloomberg, who at least paid them well while they were there, she paid them a pittance, lower than average salaries in the business, according to these Glass Door reviews, with Atlantic editorial fellows, a glorified intern position for some, a particularly exploited bunch. The review says they didn't even get their birthdays celebrated.

As for Laurene, pay no attention to that extra $3.1 billion she's accumulated into her shareholding portfolio just since the coronavirus lockdowns.

Fact is, if she really cared about her magazine's employees, she could easily cough up enough to keep them on payroll, particularly since they are low-paid. But she doesn't.

Like Michael Bloomberg, she's dined out on projecting the impression that she'd always be there to take care of her employees, quite impervious to market forces, and anyone lucky enough to get a slot at The Atlantic would be set for life. Better still, she's a lefty, so all the lefties flocked to her, the true conservatives were booted out, and the magazine itself became a wretched shadow of its former brilliant self, gobbled up in political correctness. Kevin Williamson, the National Review writer who had been poised to take a position there before he was drummed out on outrageous political correctness grounds, must right about now be thinking he dodged a bullet. The other lefties didn't.

That's why this is schadenfreude. Powell projected all the bad attributes of leftwingery and none of the purported generosity. Lefty billionaires in fact see themselves as exempt from human compassion, even as they present themselves as the wonderful alternative to capitalism. Ace, at Ace of Spades, has some additional skewerings here.

Well, now the staffers know about that. Powell of course is the bigger bad guy here than they are, but how they promoted this hag and her ideas against capitalism, thinking they would be protected. What a delusion that was. There's no one so cold-hearted out there as a far-left billionaire.",fake

Larry Hogan (R) announced that people who have been exposed to the coronavirus but are not showing symptoms will be able to get tested at several state-run testing sites starting Thursday. No appointment or doctor’s referral will be needed. He also authorized store pharmacies to purchase and administer tests.



Hogan has come under pressure recently from local leaders who say more people need to be tested before their regions can begin to reopen.



“This will help doctors diagnose and treat new cases more quickly, and it will further increase the safety of our state for all citizens,” Hogan said in a statement.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has set up two testing sites in the city, and is especially encouraging people who have symptoms, are front-line workers, live in institutional settings or are 65 or older to get tested.

And Prince William County offered free testing for all county residents Monday and Tuesday — no appointment or symptoms needed.

These measures include closing “non-essential” businesses, schools, universities and public services for a specified time period. Other measures focus on “social distancing” and prohibiting meetings, sports events and other public gatherings.

Opinion

Despite our best preventive health measures, thousands of people are expected to be hospitalized. This will be expensive.

ProPublica and the Harvard Global Health Institute have recently released a fascinating analysis of U.S. national, regional and municipal hospital capacity and how it relates to COVID-19.

The report looks at U.S. hospital capacity under various scenarios. The report asks what would happen to an area’s hospital capacity if 20%, 40% or 60% of an area’s population were infected with COVID-19 over a six-month, 12-month or 18-month interval.

For example, Chicago would reach approximately 120% of total hospital capacity if 20% of the population were infected in six months, according to this model. However, if 20% of Chicago’s population were infected over 18 months, hospital capacity would not be reached.

Many of those who have been infected with COVID-19 will be admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and will require support with mechanical ventilators.

The health insurance dilemma caused by unemployment

A majority of Americans receive their health insurance through their jobs. But on April 2, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that over 6 million people filed for unemployment benefits.

Many of these people have lost their health insurance and have joined the ranks of the approximately 28 million Americans who had no health insurance prior to the COVID-19 crisis.

It has been estimated that just one hospitalization for COVID-19 may range from $38,000 to $74,000. So not only must families worry about contracting COVID-19, they may also have to worry about being uninsured and, if someone becomes ill, potentially having to take dire financial steps, including filing for bankruptcy.

A potential solution

The Trump administration has recently stated that it would help hospitals by providing coverage for uninsured COVID-19 patients. But a better way to solve this problem might be to look at two very successful health programs — Medicare and Medicaid. These two programs could be expanded. The expansion would cover many of those uninsured Americans.

While the Trump administration’s plan to help uninsured COVID-19 patients is laudable, the plan does little to help uninsured patients who have other health issues requiring hospitalization. Here are a couple of suggestions to fix things:

• Consider lowering the age of Medicare eligibility to 60 years. This would help those working people who are not old enough to have Medicare eligibility, which begins at age 65.

• Relax the criteria for Medicaid eligibility. This can be done through an 1115 waiver. This provision allows a state to request additional funding and flexibility in determining eligibility in providing care to those who qualify for Medicaid. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has applied for a such a waiver for Illinois.

Both these steps will help us be better prepared for health care in the COVID-19 era . . . and the post-COVID-19 era.

We need to pressure the Congress and the Trump administration to address the long-term issue of health care and the uninsured by expanding eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

In the entire country, a record 38.6 million Americans have filed for unemployment during the pandemic. That corresponds to nearly 25% of the entire United States labor force. While many of these folks are receiving unemployment from state and federal government, many others are not.

Millions of Americans — who watched states close non-essential businesses, subsequently crushing their careers — cannot even access unemployment benefits, according to the Economic Policy Institute. While some of these problems have been remedied, for others, collecting unemployment insurance was never an option.

Business owners who were unable to obtain an SBC loan or other forms of COVID-19 government subsistence have been frantically fighting to reopen their business as they watched their life savings go up in flames. The Free Thought Project has reported on multiple instances in which people unable to obtain government support have tried to reopen their businesses to support themselves, only to leave them in handcuffs. It’s a catch-22.

Of those millions of jobless claims in the United States, over a quarter-million of them were in the state of Oklahoma. With a population just under 4 million, 275,000 unemployed residents are massive. While some of these folks have likely sought out and found jobs to support themselves and their families, others have likely endured conditions that may have prevented them from doing so.

As a result of the state shutting down the economy, these unemployed residents of the state have been unable to pay their bills, including their rent and house notes. Now, in spite of the fact that this record spike in unemployment was a function of the state’s COVID-19 measures, Oklahoma is taking action in the form of evictions.

On their Facebook page this week, the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office announced that they will begin physically evicting residents unable to pay their bills. It reads as follows:

EVICTION NOTICE UPDATE We know that this will be difficult, but want to give as much notice as possible regarding OCSO deputies serving eviction notices. Deputies will start serving judicial eviction orders this week, and enforcing evictions on May 26, 2020. We understand how tough times are currently for many as a result of the health crisis the past few months, but we must enforce orders issued by the courts. Once the order is served tenants have 48-hours to leave the premises of the residence they are renting/leasing. Please, if you are set for an eviction hearing, attend. Make your case to the judge, the only person who can determine your case. Civil process, and our issuing evictions is mandated by state law: https://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp… We will be compassionate, and respectful during scheduled evictions. We are hopeful that everyone issued an eviction will be able to make living arrangements.

Now, as the inevitable effects of the government’s shutdown order crash the economy and force people to choose between eating and paying their rent, that same government is going to start kicking them out of their homes.

See how that works?

As banks and other large corporations across the country receive hundreds of billions in Federal money — ensuring a lifetime of debt for future generations — Joe Sixpack on Main Street, USA is told to kick rocks.

No one here is advocating for people to be able to squat and exploit this situation to get out of paying their house note or rent. However, that is not the case here. While grocery stores and fast-food restaurants are hiring, other businesses are told they must operate at 25% capacity or remain closed entirely. This is hardly sustainable when it comes to maintaining a decent workforce with substantial pay.

Unfortunately, this is likely the beginning of an economic snowball that will continue to grow as the next few months roll on. As TFTP has predicted from the beginning, the shutdown of the economy will have lasting consequences, unprecedented in nature, and that will be here for a long time. As this case in Oklahoma and countless other ones illustrate, the government’s promise of “safety” almost always ends in human suffering.

On top of that, Trump complained, that figure also includes asymptomatic cases rather than just the most debilitating ones. More than 91,000 Americans have died from the virus.

“When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing,” the president said. “I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?”

“So, I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor,” he concluded. “It’s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.”

The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to spin its early failures on access to coronavirus testing throughout the country. Testing has ramped up immensely over the past month as public-health experts emphasized the importance of a robust testing operation to any eventual reopening of the country, and last week the White House held an event in the Rose Garden to boast that America now “leads the world in testing.”",real
1606,1474,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica-malaicha/zimbabweans-in-south-africa-use-app-to-send-food-home-after-border-restrictions-idUSKBN22V1JH?il=0,2020-05-19,Zimbabweans in South Africa use app to send food home after border restrictions,"JOHANNESBURG/HARARE (Reuters) - Petronella Mabhena, a domestic worker in South Africa, has been paying bus drivers to ferry food to her relatives in Zimbabwe for over a decade.

As with many other families from Zimbabwe whose members depend on food from South Africa, the supplies were abruptly halted when the two countries restricted movement across their border in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“I was confused and did not know what to do,” said Mabhena, 53, who sends food to her mother and daughter.

A friend told her about an app that lets people in South Africa order groceries for delivery in Zimbabwe, where prices for food and other essentials have soared amid a severe economic crisis.

Use of the app called Malaicha - Ndebele slang for the traditional way of sending goods over the border with bus and taxi drivers - surged in April, said its managing director, Sayjil Magan.

While the border has been closed to people and the taxis and buses that would normally ferry food informally, Malaicha is permitted to import goods into Zimbabwe, offering an alternative.

About a year old, the app has yet to break even, in part because its costs, including trucks and warehousing, are higher than the typical digital startup.

But if its user base continues to grow, it could emerge as a rare winner from South Africa’s lockdown, one of the world’s most restrictive.

Previously, Malaicha handled an average of 20,000 to 30,000 orders a month, Magan said, but that number increased by around 200% month-on-month in April, while user numbers grew by around 100% to 75,000.

“It’s something they are going to carry on using; that’s the feedback that we are getting from our customers,” Magan said.

In Zimbabwe’s capital Harare, one of five major cities where Malaicha operates, deliveries reached 200 a day in April, from an average of 20 before the lockdown, said warehouse manager Mario Ventouris.

Workers were putting in extra hours to clear long lines of people who had come to collect orders, he added.

Delivery driver Decide Sabamba said his job was tougher than before: “It’s busy, it’s busy every day.”

He brought cooking oil and diapers to Mabhena’s daughter, Epiphania Moyo, and her baby - their first delivery via the app.

The family is all too familiar with the frustration of traditional malaicha deliveries, which they said cost more and don’t always arrive on time or in full. Their experience with the app was different.

“They are very fast; they delivered everything. I will use it again,” Moyo added.",real
1607,1139,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2020/05/andrew_cuomo_in_all_his_ugliness.html,2020-05-16,Andrew Cuomo in All His Ugliness,"Much of the nation these past few months has focused on New York state since it became the hotspot for the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Many have also complimented Governor Andrew Cuomo’s response in fighting the pandemic, even to the point of suggesting he should substitute for presidential hopeful Joe Biden as the Democratic Party nominee to face Donald Trump in the November election.

On Tuesday, Cuomo proposed a new law that aims to prevent corporations from receiving stimulus funds as a result of COVID-19. While he presents himself as a governor who will tackle all forms of injustice, especially in light of his continual hands-on approach during this crisis, Cuomo is anything but the knight in shining armor he is being portrayed as.

Disregard for the Disabled and Elderly

Cuomo ordered nursing homes for the elderly and infirm to accept patients with COVID-19. As reported by Pamela Geller:

“Weeks before [Cuomo] prohibited these homes from turning someone away for having COVID, there were numerous reports that nursing homes, assisted living and congregate care centers were the most vulnerable to Coronavirus. [This was because] the biggest drag on New York state is Medicaid — what better way to rid the state of the old, sick, and disabled?”

Syracuse University Professor Scott Landes explained that because the home population “in general, [have] swallowing problems or disorders, or choking disorders, or just more susceptibility to lung infections [and] seem to develop pneumonia at a higher rate than those in the general population.” He added that COVID-19 is even more challenging for those living in congregate residential settings.

Towards the end of April, the CEO of a hard-hit Brooklyn nursing home, where 55 patients had died from the coronavirus, warned New York Health Department officials for weeks that he had staffing and equipment issues — yet he received little help.

In what was a self-contradiction, Cuomo — who himself has described nursing homes as a “feeding frenzy’’for the deadly coronavirus — said that the facilities cannot challenge his regulation forcing the homes to admit patients with the contagion. And although he argued that they can transfer patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus to a different facility, this too has been misleading. On a personal note, the godmother of one of my sisters, who is nearly ninety years old, was forced to stay at a nursing home despite being infected with the COVID-19 — she miraculously recovered despite not having had the required medical attention at the home that she should have received.

Manipulating Facts and Shunning Responsibility

In March, Cuomo began to gripe against President Trump, demanding up to 40,000 ventilators to tackle the coronavirus. Media outlets, such as The Washington Post sided with Cuomo, stating: “Trump questions New York’s plea for critical equipment” — yet this came after the president said: “I don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.” As it turned out, New York, according to updated models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, had already reached its peak projected ventilator usage on April 8, with a projected need of 5,008. The actual use may have been lower.

In any case, as I had previously written, had the New York governor needed so many ventilators, in 2015, after learning that the state’s stockpile of medical equipment had 16,000 fewer ventilators than New Yorkers would need in a severe pandemic, Cuomo chose not to buy more of them. Instead, he asked his health commissioner Howard Zucker to assemble a task force and draft rules for rationing the ventilators they already had.

Cuomo also recognized, but failed to do anything about, a shortage of masks and other protective gear. On March 6, as reported by CNBC, weeks before Trump raised the issue, Cuomo stated that people were stealing the equipment out of hospitals in New York. “Not just people taking a couple or three, I mean just actual thefts of those products. I’ve asked the state police to do an investigation, look at places that are selling masks, medical equipment, protective wear.” There is, however, no evidence that he or the police ever followed up, directly resulting in a shortage today.

As reported by New York City freelance reporter Danielle Tcholakian, Cuomo, on Feb. 4, announced his “Medicaid redesign team,” the latest a long line of cumbersome task forces he likes to convene and then hamstring (see, for example, the Moreland Commission, and the task force created to get HIV below epidemic levels, and whose report he delayed and whose funding recommendations he reneged on).

While one would think amidst the pandemic any elected official would seek more funding for health care, Cuomo pursued a $2.5 billion cut in Medicaid to New York’s hospitals alongside limiting their expansion to save more money. This is not to deny the problems of federal funding, however, Cuomo had avoided for years tackling substantively the problem of Medicaid in ways that were not opportunistic, such as conceding large sums of money to entities connected to political donors. He could have spent the necessary $576 million at disposal on the ventilators to prepare for the worst-case scenario, but instead he opted to spend $750 million on on a boondoggle “Buffalo Billion” solar panel factory.

Abortion

In 2019, Cuomo, on the day before the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, signed into law the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which legislates a woman’s ability to have an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy — when abortion is never medically necessary and when children born prematurely are routinely able to survive outside the womb with careful tending. It also permits non-doctors to perform abortions up to the moment of birth. He marked the moment with public celebrations, which given the context, appeared ghoulish.

Prior to signing the RHA, Cuomo’s dedication to “reproductive rights” allowed for the extermination of more than 82,000 unborn lives in his state in 2016 alone — approximately 2,000 of those unborn children were killed after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the threshold where advanced neonatal intensive care is just beginning to enable survival; nearly 6,000 of those unborn children were killed in dilation and evacuation abortions.

Cuomo, a professed Catholic, stated on Fox News: “The Catholic Church doesn’t believe in a woman’s right to choose. Yes, I understand their religious view. But I’m not here to legislate religion” — equally to blame is the Cardinal Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan for giving Cuomo a get out of jail card on the matter.

This was nothing more than a doubling-down by Cuomo since religion has nothing to do with that has been proven by science - that human life is human life. The legislation, as President Trump said during his State of the Union address last year, “allow[s] a baby to be ripped from a mother’s womb” — while Cuomo’s law classifies a “person” as a “human being who has been born and is alive” – meaning unborn babies are not “persons.”

Trump has gone so far as to define life beginning at the moment of conception.

Cuomo has made it clear that he has no plans, if the situation were to present itself, to take Sleepy Joe’s place as the Democrat candidate for president this year. That does not mean he does not aspire to the White House — Tcholakian revealed that already there have been $280 “Cuomo for President” cashmere sweaters are flying off the shelves. Whether it is this year or in 2024 when Andrew Cuomo potentially presents himself as a presidential candidate, he would do so based on a myth that he was the knight in shining armor, when in fact he has been just the opposite.

1609,1096,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/hotels-during-coronavirus-resorts-make-safety-changes-for-covid-19.html,2020-05-15,What will hotel visits be like? Here's your room-by-room look at the future,"Hotels are cautiously reopening for the summer travel season, but it's anything but business as usual in the hospitality industry. Last week, the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) introduced its Safe Stay guidelines developed under the guidance of an advisory council that includes Accor, InterContinental Hotels Group, Marriot International, Omni Hotels & Resorts and Walt Disney. Now, the health and cleaning guidelines are being adopted by thousands of hotels, with many choosing to go beyond its recommendations.

Getting to your hotel

Arriving by air? There's a chance your hotel has started cleaning the area around you before you're even left the airport. Sandals Resorts identified 18 key touch points — or points of high contact — for extra cleaning, starting with airport lounges and vehicle transfers. Many hotels are increasing the frequency of airport transfers to reduce the number of passengers in each vehicle too.

If you're arriving via your own car, don't assume a valet team will be waiting out front, as many hotels like the Hotel Crescent Court in Dallas, Texas are suspending the service. Other hotels are keeping it and disinfecting the vehicle between drivers. Bell hops — where are the bell hops? Be prepared to carry your own bags. Camelback Resort in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains has suspended its bell service, though guests can use bell carts which have been sanitized after every use. Its hotel employees aren't opening car or taxi doors upon arrival either.

Stepping into the lobby

Don't be alarmed if you're stopped at the hotel's front door for a wellness screening and temperature check. This is what Camelback is doing. The resort — which is scheduled to reopen on June 11 — is also asking guests to use hand sanitizer, wear a mask and comply with six-foot social distancing policies. Next, you reach for the front door, and — there's no handle? It's been removed to eliminate a major touch point. How about a welcome drink? No dice. Instead, you'll be provided with branded PPE (personal protective equipment) upon arrival. Inside the lobby, you will likely find your favorite hotel looks different. Aesthetics are taking a backseat to safety with social distancing signage displayed throughout hotels, hand sanitizing stations placed every 50 to 100 feet and furniture removed to discourage congregating. Floors may be marked to encourage one-way pedestrian flow between entrances and exits.

Checking into your room

To check in, there is a good chance you'll avoid the front desk entirely. Hotels, such as the The Wayfinder Hotel in Newport, Rhode Island, are offering curbside check-in while major hotel chains are transitioning to ""digital keys"" which allow you to check in and out (and pay your bill) via your mobile phone. This eliminates the need for magnetic key cards (which must be sanitized after every use), queuing with other guests and interacting with the front desk staff. Hilton has introduced contactless check-in and check-outs at more than 4,700 hotels around the globe, including its Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels & Resorts. The new technology will require enhanced communication with guests, many of whom are accustomed to heading straight to the front desk, which is exactly what hotels want to avoid.

Mobile phone check-ins mean guests will spend less time in communal areas, like those of the Waldorf Astoria Jerusalem (shown here). © 2020 Hilton

Front desk staff will still be present — likely standing behind a plexiglass partition — and sporting new accoutrements to their impeccably polished attire: masks and gloves. Chip and pin readers will be used to avoid the need to pass credit cards for payment, an act the AHLA recommends should result in an employee washing their hands ""for at least 20 seconds."" The front desk, even if not used much, will be cleaned at multiple points throughout the day, as will elevator buttons, public bathrooms, vending machines, ATMs, handrails and seating areas.

Walking through the hotel

Staff may no longer escort you to — or show you around — your room, and elevators are being limited to just the people in your party. The latter may not be as hard as it sounds, as more hotels are instituting maximum guest occupancy rates, such as the Relais & Chateaux hotel Eden Roc Cap Cana in the Dominican Republic which will operate at a maximum of 30% capacity, while European luxury hotel brand Rocco Forte Hotels is limiting the number of guests per floor.

On the way to the room, you'll likely pass more cleaning staff than in the past — for good reason. ""Hotels will have more visual cleaning staff and sanitizing stations. Housekeepers will move from behind the scene to front and center in hotels,"" said Tony Kim, assistant professor at Hart School of Hospitality, Sport and Recreation management at James Madison University, noting the mere presence of cleaning staff will make guests feel safer.

Inside your hotel room

Changes to your room may be apparent before you even enter. Hilton is applying a seal on guestroom doors to indicate they haven't been accessed since they were last cleaned. The room itself may look strangely bare. Why? Items that are difficult to disinfect are missing, including decorative pillows, bed scarves, notepads, pamphlets and pens. Minibars — they're gone too, though they may be replaced in another way, such as the pop-up bodegas being installed at the front desk of Kimpton luxury boutique hotels. Other items, such as robes, will be available upon request. On the upside, a welcome drink and cool hand towel may be waiting for you in your room, as Sandals Resorts are doing. Many hotels are giving guests in-room personal safety kits stocked with masks, disinfectant and wipes.

Guests at luxury, all-inclusive AMResorts in the Caribbean and Central and South America will find pillows, blankets and in-room tablets sealed in vacuum packaging. Remington Hotels — a Dallas-based hospitality group that manages select Sheraton, Westin and Marriott hotels among others — is testing Germ Guard, a single-use preventative sleeve that slides over remote control devices. Daily newspaper deliveries are going digital with electronic PressReader access that customers can read on their personal devices. Similarly, face-to-face concierge services are moving to text messaging through software such as Kipsu and Whistle. None of this — not one part — will come easy for hotels. ""Hotels have always focused on personalized service and providing a warm, welcoming environment for its guests,"" said Kate Walsh, the dean of the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""The challenge for hotels will be to convey the essence of hospitality when we socially distance and disconnect guests from the staff.""

Housekeeping matters

Perhaps one of the biggest changes will be to housekeeping services. Room cleanings will be more intense but conducted less often, at least for guests staying multiple nights. Unless specifically requested, most cleanings will be done after guests leave. Some hotels, such as Best Western, are waiting 24 to 72 hours to enter a room after guests have left. Room cleanings are now concentrating on high-touch points, such as door and furniture handles, faucets, light switches, remote controls, thermostats, clocks and hangers. Used towels may be placed outside the door for pickup and replaced with a sealed bag of fresh ones, again found outside the door. Major brands such as Hilton and Marriott are turning to electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light technology. Sandals Resorts are sanitizing air ducts upon each departure and steam-cleaning room carpets every week.

The Westin Houston Medical Center was the first hotel to deploy robots to disinfect guest rooms and communal areas. Made by San Antonio-based Xenex Disinfection Services, the germ-zapping robots are designed to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses using UV light. They have been shown to destroy coronavirus, the company says.

Restaurants and room service

Amani Roberts, co-director of Cal State Fullerton's Center for Entertainment and Hospitality Management, believes hotel food and beverage outlets and banquet facilities will be affected more than any other area. ""I personally think buffets will no longer be in existence, which will increase food costs for hotels,"" he said. The AHLA recommends limiting buffets, but if offered, serving them via a masked attendant. Remington Hotels are moving away from buffets to open seating arrangements in outdoor areas. ""Many restaurants in a hotel will either remain closed or limit the capacity. If remaining closed, hotels will offer room delivery service — some via a robot-delivery system — or quick grab-and-go service,"" said Kim. ""If hotels decided to open, they will limit the capacity by removing some tables and chairs and installing partitions for communal tables.""

Remington's Le Pavillon Hotel — near the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana — is no longer providing buffets or open receptions. Courtesy of Remington Hotels

Hotel restaurants are moving to paper and digital menus, the latter located on walls or via customer's mobile phone, with a renewed reliance on single-use plastic and paper products. Bar stools are being removed to provide space between customers. Payment will happen table-side at sanitized mobile credit card terminals, like that at the InterContinental Los Angeles Downtown. Other hotels are getting creative. Room service menus are being expanded, delivery is moving to ""knock and drop"" at guest doors and ordering is done via customers' mobile phones, such as that offered at over 3,200 Marriott hotels. The Palms Turks & Caicos is introducing family-style in-room dining menus, and the historic Washington School House Hotel in Park City, Utah, has started a new ""Anyplace Dining"" option where guests can eat in quiet parts of the hotel, by the pool and in the private garden.

Communal spaces and entertainment

Many sports and recreational areas are closed or operating at limited capacities with enhanced cleanings. Some hotels are limiting pools to half the normal number of people allowed. ""Similar to guests making a massage appointment, hotels may now require advance-timed reservations for using the tennis court, pool, spa and other amenities,"" said Rob Karp, CEO of luxury travel agency MilesAhead.

That's what Maine's Kennebunkport Resort Collection decided to do when it made the gym accessible by reservation only. It's cleaning the gym before and after each guest and introducing in-room fitness options. Other hotels are allowing guests to use bikes, beach chairs and umbrellas but are cleaning them after every use.

1615,1724,https://dnyuz.com/2020/05/22/trumps-press-secretary-displays-one-of-his-checks-in-a-little-too-much-detail/,2020-05-22,Trump’s Press Secretary Displays One of His Checks in a Little Too Much Detail,"WASHINGTON — It’s a feel-good story that President Trump’s press secretaries have relished over the years: the quarterly announcement of which government agency Mr. Trump has selected to be the lucky recipient of his salary, an easy way to show the president sticking to his 2016 campaign pledge to forgo his $400,000 salary and donate it.

In the past, the $100,000 check from Mr. Trump has been made out to the Small Business Administration initiative to help veteran entrepreneurs, to the Office of the Surgeon General to fight the opioid epidemic, and to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, among other places.

But on Friday, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, did not just reveal that the president was sending his salary to the Department of Health and Human Services to help “support the efforts being undertaken to confront, contain and combat the coronavirus.”

She also displayed the president’s private bank account and routing numbers.

The $100,000 check she held up like a prop appeared to be a real check from Capital One, complete with the relevant details. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an administration official said mock checks were never used in the briefing.

For an average civilian, that information could be used to withdraw or deposit money, make online purchases or hack an account.

“It’s not a best practice to share that information publicly,” said Eva Velasquez, the president and chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center. “If you don’t have protections in place, there are sophisticated schemes and ways someone could access those funds knowing the account and routing number and the individual person it belongs to.”

Ms. Velasquez said that a bank was almost certain to have additional protections in place on the account of a high-profile person like the president. Mr. Trump, she said, was not likely to be hacked because of photographs that subsequently circulated online Friday night suggesting it appeared to be a real check.

But she said the image of Ms. McEnany flashing Mr. Trump’s personal information in front of cameras sent a concerning message. “This is one of those situations where setting the example is very important,” Ms. Velasquez said. “It’s very important for your average person to understand this is not a best practice.

Mike Chapple, a teaching professor of information technology at the University of Notre Dame, said the appearance showed why large promotional checks were used for television appearances. “They’re not only a nice prop onstage, but they also omit the sensitive account information that normally appears at the bottom of the check,” he said. “The rest of us should play it safe and keep our account numbers to ourselves.”

1622,598,https://www.cnbc.com/select/coronavirus-credit-card-applications-drop-when-to-apply-for-new-card/,2020-05-05,Credit card applications have dropped by 40% amid coronavirus—here's when to apply for a new card,"When consumers face economic hardship, opening a new credit card may be a helpful option to get by. But surprisingly, many Americans aren't taking this approach during the global coronavirus pandemic. New credit card applications were down 40% from the first week of March to the last week, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Consumer Credit Panel. The report looked at hard inquiry data, or the number of times consumers' credit was pulled for an application. Results revealed that the credit card industry is not the only one seeing a drop; auto loan inquiries have decreased by 52% and mortgage inquiries by 27%. What's a hard inquiry? Each time you apply for credit, the lender will perform a ""hard inquiry"" or ""soft inquiry."" Hard inquiries are the most common and appear on your credit report after you submit an application, which may ding your credit score temporarily. Meanwhile, soft inquiries have no effect on your credit. The CFPB cited that this sharp drop in new inquiries could be due to a lowered demand for credit (people are spending less), or a drop in credit supply that may indirectly or directly raise consumers' expectation of being turned down for credit. In other words — consumers expect it will be harder to qualify for credit or a loan, given the number of banks scaling back on lending during the market's current conditions.

Why people with higher credit scores are applying for fewer cards

Suprisingly, card applications declined significantly more for consumers with super prime scores (above a 780 VantageScore) compared to consumers with deep subprime scores (below 500), at a rate of 59% and 34%, respectively. The CFPB pointed out that while all types of inquiries declined notably, consumers with higher credit scores had the most substantial drop. This could indicate they have more flexibility in substituting new credit applications with other means of financial support, such as emergency savings or passive income. Regardless if you have savings or not, you may still want to apply for a credit card. A new card can provide an extended credit limit, which is something you may need if you've recently been laid off or had your credit limit reduced without notice. It could also reward you with cash back for stocking up on groceries and streaming Netflix. But before you apply for a new credit card, we review some tips below.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday that all city and county residents who want a coronavirus test can now get one for the first time since COVID-19 cases began appearing there in January.

Free COVID-19 testing is available to any L.A. County resident. https://t.co/13jZaOOegy — MayorOfLA (@MayorOfLA) April 30, 2020

The announcement, which makes Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the nation to offer free testing to all its residents, came on the same day that county health officials reported a surge in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which they attributed in part to more widespread testing.

The Los Angeles County Health Department confirmed another 1,541 cases — its largest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. It also reported 56 additional deaths because of the coronavirus.

Health officials say despite the uptick, the rate of hospitalization and death in the county has remained steady. Los Angeles County now has a total of nearly 22,500 confirmed cases — accounting for nearly half of California's more than 46,000.

Until now, because of a scarcity of test kits, only people showing symptoms of COVID-19, essential workers and those in institutional settings such as nursing homes could receive a test in Los Angeles.

Garcetti's announcement could be a significant milestone, because health officials say without widespread testing they are unable to accurately track the spread of the disease. That information could then be used to determine when it is safe to ease stay-at-home orders.

Now, any LA city or county resident who wants a test can make an appointment and get one at one of dozens of testing sites in the area, the mayor said at a news conference on Wednesday.

But he added that people showing symptoms would still be given priority for testing.

Garcetti said Los Angeles currently accounts for about 9% of all the tests nationwide.

Students who hadn’t seen each other since in-person classes ended abruptly in March amid the coronavirus outbreak commiserated over all they’ve missed out on, including the prom and a senior class trip.

Some also wondered about what they may have lost academically.

“Honestly, remote learning, I don’t think was my favorite thing,” said 18-year-old Isabella Branson. “It’s kind of hard to stay motivated when you don’t have anything to look forward to and you don’t see your friends.”

The small district in rural Georgia is among many around the U.S. that have pulled the plug on distance learning, all citing familiar reasons. It’s too stressful, the lack of devices and internet access is too much to overcome, and what students get from it just isn’t worth the struggle.

In Georgia, where the school year is ending early for one of every 10 students, many district leaders say the final weeks of the school year would have been dedicated anyway to preparing for and taking standardized tests that are now canceled. The governor and state schools superintendent who have moved to dismantle parts of Georgia’s high-stakes testing system have said they are not opposed to fewer instructional days.

“We didn’t cut any class time out,” Chattahoochee County High School Principal Josh Kemp said. “There was no reason to pile more on our parents and students.”

But Kemp and others also acknowledge that there was material that wasn’t covered and that teachers will have to find a way to fold it in next year for returning students.

“They weren’t able to get all the standards,” said Tammy Bailey, the science department chair at the high school. “I think there will be a gap.”

Classes had been scheduled to run through May 21 but remote instruction instead came to an end May 8 in the Chattahoochee County school district. A majority of the high school’s 450 students live on the U.S. Army’s sprawling Fort Benning, while a minority live around the small town of Cusseta. Only 59% of households in the district have access to broadband internet at home.

Other districts around the country that are ending the school year early including Omaha and some nearby suburban districts in Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and some in New Hampshire. Officials say they want to relieve stress on families, ease problems for students without internet access, and focus on preparing for a fresh start in the fall.

The last three weeks of school is “probably not prime instructional time,” said Andrew McEachin, an education policy researcher at RAND Corp. But he said that kids in struggling households may suffer most from being cut off from the normalcy of a school routine.

“I think the biggest thing about cutting a school year short is not what it does on average, but what it does on equity,” McEachin said. “Even if school isn’t working as well as we want it to be, that may be the best access low income students have to learning.”

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said on April 16 that he trusted schools to set their calendars and the following day, state Superintendent Richard Woods wrote that schools’ focus during the pandemic should “not be on test scores” but on making sure children are “healthy, safe and nurtured.”

But Michael O’Sullivan, executive director of GeorgiaCAN, a group that supports Georgia’s testing system, says this spring has been a preview of a “zero-accountability world.”

“It’s the easy way out of a very difficult situation, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be good for kids,” O’Sullivan said.

Some schools in Georgia are making plans to combat academic losses from the year, such as beefed-up summer sessions. The Scintilla Charter Academy in Valdosta is aiming to start the next school year on July 23, to make up the time it lost when it ended on April 30.

Scintilla Dean of School Mandy Avera said her families were “stressed and overwhelmed” by online learning. The school covers kindergarten through sixth grade, and Avera is among educators who question whether younger children can successfully acquire critical skills like learning to read without a face-to-face interaction with a teacher.

“It just created a situation where we just can’t be as interactive as we like to be at Scintilla,” Avera said. “Kindergartners don’t understand why they’re at home. They don’t understand why they can’t go back to school and see their friends and see their teachers.”

Back in Cusseta, some seniors were stressing about being able to bring only four guests to a socially-distant graduation ceremony, while others were disregarding imposed distance to hug and gossip. But Chattahoochee County Superintendent Kristi Brooks was already trying to think about the next school year, despite uncertainty on whether in-person classes will resume.

“They’re going to have missed 60 days of instruction,” Brooks said “When we come back for the fall, we’re going to have to pick up in some basic areas.”",real

UPDATED 4-18-20

There is increasing evidence that COVID-19 isn’t your typical virus. Thankfully many researchers, scientists and doctors are observing trends that are changing the way we are treating it in hospitals and at home.

I should be writing this at the beginning of all my articles in the last month but due to the fact that we are all living in real time and the information coming out is changing moment by moment even the best scientist’s theories on how to combat this illness continue to evolve. Although things could certainly change as larger studies come forth, for the moment I wanted to share with you some exciting new details that are emerging theories, which could affect future treatment development.

Current Theory and Treatment for Coronavirus

Currently COVID-19 is being treated as a dysfunction of the lower respiratory tract. It’s primary symptoms are:(1)

Fever Cough Shortness of breath

Interestingly, a large number of COVID-19 patients also report a loss of taste and smell. In mild cases of COVID-19, the virus will run its course and resolve on its own. But if this disease progresses to a critical level, patients spiral into a state of severe hypoxemia – where the body is unable to effectively deliver life-sustaining oxygen to the rest of the body. Without adequate oxygen delivery, vital organs and tissues are starved of oxygen and begin shutting down – which can eventually lead to death.

The current treatments assume that coronavirus is causing a build-up of liquid (instead of air) in the alveoli – making it difficult for oxygen to transfer through the fluid and make its way into the bloodstream. To counteract oxygen deprivation caused by this build up of fluid, COVID-19 is currently being treated as a case of acute respiratory distress, also known as ARDS. The standard treatment for ARDS is mechanical ventilation – which will force air into the alveoli in hopes of transferring oxygen into the blood.

The problem is, treating COVID-19 with ventilation isn’t working like it should. In fact, some doctors have observed that the use of ventilators may even be harming some patients. So that brings up the question – what if our current understanding of COVID-19 is wrong?

Emerging ideas on the virus…

There is mounting evidence suggesting that our initial understanding of exactly how coronavirus impacts the body may be incorrect.

Consider these mysteries of COVID-19:

Patients are showing blood oxygen levels so low that they should be life-threatening, but without showing the typical signs of distress that are expected when the same levels are reached due to lung dysfunction. (2) Doctors are saying that ventilators aren’t working as well as they should be and may even be harming some people. (2) Many patients report a loss of taste and smell, typically associated with zinc deficiency, not respiratory disease. Researchers have noted that the pathological mechanism that causes the damage to the body remains a mystery. (3) Twenty percent of COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. (4) Fatality rates, even among places with robust testing in place, are wildly different.

These discrepancies have hinted at a new culprit as well as new possible solutions. So, should we be treating COVID-19 differently? To answer that question, first let’s look at exactly how a healthy body is designed to deliver oxygen to your tissues.

How Our Cells Are Designed Carry Oxygen

As you inhale air, oxygen enters your lungs and reaches the alveoli which is lined with a layer of cells that creates the barrier between your lungs and your bloodstream. Oxygen molecules pass through this barrier and attach themselves to a protein called hemoglobin that is bound to your red blood cells. Once your red blood cells have picked up oxygen, they set off to begin delivering it to the rest of the tissues in your body.

Think of your red blood cells like little rafts that are responsible for picking up oxygen and carrying it to your tissues which rely on oxygen for survival. And think of hemoglobin like people on the raft working as a delivery crew – tasked with receiving, holding, and dropping off oxygen molecules. Without the “delivery crew” of hemoglobin proteins, the raft is useless.

It’s also important to understand a little more about the structure of hemoglobin. A vital component of hemoglobin proteins are heme groups – which are embedded in the hemoglobin and are responsible for binding and releasing oxygen molecules.These heme groups are a metal complex and contain iron as the central metal atom, with each iron molecule capable of carrying one oxygen molecule.5 These iron rich heme groups are critical – without them your cells are unable to transport the oxygen your tissues depend on.

This understanding the body carries oxygen has sparked speculation about how COVID-19 may be exerting it’s devastating effects by creating more reactive oxygen species causing tissue damage and hypoxia.

A New Theory on COVID-19’s Mechanism of Injury

One the most puzzling aspects of COVID-19, is that despite fitting most of the criteria under the definition of acute respiratory failure there is one glaring contradiction. With the coronavirus, there appears to be hypoxia or low oxygen saturation in the blood rather than respiratory distress as seen in classic respiratory failure. Meaning many patients present with severe hypoxia with nearly normal respiratory function.6 This remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe cases of ARDS.

Interestingly, it may be creating a clinical picture similar to someone suffering from severe malaria or altitude illness.

Could COVID-19 Be affecting Oxygen Carrying Capacity?

In COVID-19’s final and severe stages, the lungs are severely damaged. But new information on this virus’s cellular process in the body is revealing that the final condition of the lungs and accompanying respiratory failure may actually be more of a case of massive oxidative stress overload disrupting the capacity of hemoglobin to carry oxygen to tissues rather than an outright attack on the air sacs in the lungs.

The theory on coronavirus affecting the blood's oxygen carrying capacity is related to the fact that increased intracellular oxidative stress is at the core of all pathogenic infections. This is often referred to as an increase in reactive oxygen species or ROS. This ROS production is at the core of much of the damage we are seeing not only to the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to the tissues, causing severe hypoxia or low oxygen but also damaging all tissues they come in contact with. As Integrative and functional medicine doctors, we often measure markers of oxidative stress in our patient’s urine to determine if this process is out of control. One such marker is lipid peroxides. According to Dr. Tom Levy the intracellular levels of Vitamin C, magnesium and glutathione largely affect the oxidative stress which could damage the tissues, one reason why you are seeing Vitamin C being used in hospitals to treat the virus. Stay tuned as I will be writing more about Vitamin C in upcoming blog articles.

This cascade of events would explain:

Why as many as one in five COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. Why IV nutrients that target cardiovascular function are beneficial. Why many people experience a loss of taste and smell. Why anti-malarial medications are showing promising results.

This would also explain why ventilators aren’t working quite like we’d expect. Ventilators work by forcing more air into the lungs, so more oxygen can be delivered to the blood. This is helpful when there’s liquid or inflammation in the lungs, and the blood is working normally – like in pneumonia. However, if there is an issue due to the fact that oxidative stress (ROS) has altered the blood’s ability to properly carry this oxygen, then a ventilator can’t do its job. Right now, the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that COVID-19 patients are candidates for “early, invasive ventilation”. But if we’re ventilating patients who are struggling to keep their little oxygen boats afloat in the bloodstream due to massive oxidative stress, ventilation will do little good and could even cause damage.(8)

This theory would also give us some more insight as to why certain populations may be more at risk of contracting COVID-19.

This Might Explain Why Anti-malarial Medications are Being Considered for Treatment.

Hydroxychloroquine, also known as Plaquenil, is an anti-malarial medication that is showing promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. If coronavirus is in fact attacking red blood cells, similar to the way malaria does, then it would make sense why an anti-malarial drug would be beneficial for coronavirus patients. But how exactly could hydroxychloroquine be exerting these antiviral effects?

Research is finding that it might be due to hydroxychloroquine’s relationship with the mineral zinc. You see, hydroxychloroquine is a zinc ionophore – meaning it enhances your body’s ability to allow zinc into your cells.9 When intracellular concentrations of zinc are increased, it displays broad spectrum antiviral activity in a few ways:

Zinc inhibits the actions of certain proteins necessary for the completion of different phases of the virus’s life cycle – essentially halting its ability to reproduce(10) Zinc supports a robust immune response by aiding in the production of cytokines and the modulation of immune cells(10) Zinc acts as a powerful antioxidant and prooxidant – neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by toxic overload of iron that has been dumped into the blood from the burst cells(11,12)

Interestingly, one of the initial symptoms reported by many coronavirus patients is a loss of taste and smell. This lack of taste and smell can be caused by a zinc deficiency. Perhaps the action of hydroxychloroquine helping zinc enter cells is part of the reason the drug has benefitted some COVID-19 patients.13 It’s important to note that in order for hydroxychloroquine to work, there must be adequate zinc levels available to allow into the cells – so hydroxychloroquine must be administered in conjunction with zinc to be most effective against COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine has shown promise (as well as a risk of severe cardiac arrhythmia in certain patients) but the way the drug functions has given us some powerful insights and may give us answers into how we can save more lives.

The Connection Between COVID-19 and Altitude Sickness

Another interesting connection is the fact that COVID-19’s clinical presentation is quite similar to another respiratory illness – high altitude pulmonary edema, also known as altitude sickness. In both COVID-19 and high altitude pulmonary edema clinical findings include:(14)

A decreased ratio of arterial oxygen levels to inspired oxygen Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) Low carbon dioxide levels A ground glass appearance in the lung tissues Elevated fibrinogen levels Diffuse alveolar damage

In altitude sickness, the lungs are functioning fine – there are just inadequate levels of oxygen to process to properly meet the needs of the body. Clinical findings similar to altitude sickness would make sense if COVID-19 is in fact causing a dysfunction of red blood cells through production of massive oxidative stress rather than a direct problem with the lungs.

So What Are Potential Options to Quench Oxidative Stress?

Even with all of the information that points to COVID-19 creating massive oxidative stress, there are still a lot of unknowns. The downside of this is of course the trial and error and continued research that needs to take place before we have real answers. The upside, is that this information gives us an array of new potential treatment options to consider:

High Dose Vitamin C:

High doses of vitamin C are garnering attention as a powerful way to potentially mitigate the effects of coronavirus. These ultra-high doses of vitamin C are speculated to fight the massive immune response and subsequent respiratory failure seen in coronavirus infection by:(15,16)

Suppressing the over-reactive inflammatory response in the lungs Minimizing the accumulation of immune cells in the tissues of the lungs Decreasing the release of cytokines (chemical messengers involved in the immune response) Slowing down the viruses ability to reproduce and spread Neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by the massive amounts of iron floating around in the bloodstream

Ideally, high dose vitamin C can be delivered intravenously, where it is more easily absorbed and utilized intracellularly. But oral vitamin C can also be beneficial if taken correctly. While regular over the counter oral vitamin C causes diarrhea, liposomal Vitamin C at frequent intervals does not, and is an effective way to increase intracellular levels. Several New York hospitals have approved intravenous vitamin C as a therapy for the first time ever in studies being conducted on the virus.

Glutathione:

Glutathione is a potent antioxidant naturally found in most of the cells in your body. Glutathione plays a few major roles in immune function including:

Functioning as a signaling molecule – helping balance inflammation levels and modulating immune system response(17) Reducing oxidative injury by neutralizing harmful toxins (18) Regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis(19)

There is a growing mountain of evidence finding that the most effective way to take glutathione may be through inhalation. Inhaled glutathione (aerosolized or nebulized) is already being used in the treatment of a variety of respiratory-related conditions and has been garnering attention as a possible treatment option for COVID-19.(20)

Inhaled Hydrogen:

The inhalation of concentrated hydrogen gas is another potential treatment option due to its powerful antioxidant properties. Inhaling hydrogen gas has been found to:(21,22)

Reduce oxidative-stress induced damage Reduce cellular apoptosis Improve gas exchange in the lungs Block the production of proinflammatory mediators

Inhaled hydrogen gas may be particularly effective when paired with other anti-oxidative therapies such as IV vitamin C and inhaled glutathione.

Other Antiviral Drugs:

A number of other antiviral medications are being studied for their potential to treat COVID-19. These include:

Methylene Blue : Methylene Blue is a medication that has been used in the treatment of malaria due to its powerful antiviral properties – killing the virus at an impressive speed. (23) It’s also used in the treatment of a condition known as methemoglobinemia – a condition in which individuals have too much methemoglobin which is a form of hemoglobin that is much less effective at carrying oxygen. Methylene blue works by converting methemoglobin into a type of hemoglobin that can more effectively transport oxygen.(24) Remdesivir : Remdesivir is another antiviral drug used for Ebola. Remdesivir is showing benefit in solid studies – a small but well-conducted study on severe cases in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan concluded that Remdesvir caused clinical improvement in 68% of patients. (25) Favipiravir : Favipiravir is a powerful anti-viral agent that inhibits the virus from replicating and spreading. (26) It has been approved in China and Japan for the treatment of influenza and is undergoing research to determine its potential efficacy in treating COVID-19. (27)

Hyperbaric Treatment:

Hyperbaric treatment works in two ways. First, inspired oxygen concentration is increased to nearly 100%. Secondly, ambient pressure is increased to about three times higher than the air pressure we normally breathe. This combination is designed to essential “hyper oxygenate” your blood – improving oxygen delivery to your tissues.(28)

Hyperbaric treatment may be an effective adjunct therapy to help COVID-19 patients recover, especially when administered early.

Could This Bring Us One Step Closer to Finding a Cure for COVID-19?

There are still many unknowns when it comes to coronavirus. The only thing we know for certain is that we are in a race against time. I hope we will continue to search for clues and change course when wrong.

I urge my fellow clinicians and researchers to examine this virus and its mechanism of action with fresh eyes. We entered into this field knowing we were signing up for being lifetime students. This current pandemic is calling us to rise to the occasion – the world is counting on us to find the answers it needs.

In my own practice, I will continue to give my patients and readers the most up-to-date tools they need to protect themselves amidst this pandemic. Until we have a solid understanding of this virus, I will continue to seek new information to do my part in fighting back against COVID-19 and update you when we find more information to help patients get well.

Give Your Immune System the Support It Needs

Along with continued research to identify the root cause of COVID-19, I am also working on equipping our clinic to offer treatments to support your immune system during this time. Based on our current understanding we may consider offering some of the following options.

IV Vitamin C and Glutathione: A powerful combination of two of the most potent antioxidants delivered intravenously so they can be immediately used by the cells to combat oxidative damage. Inhaled Glutathione: Inhaling glutathione delivers it directly to your lung cells – replenishing their antioxidant stores that are quickly used up when fighting inflammation. Inhaled Hydrogen: Pairing inhaled hydrogen’s impressive anti-inflammatory effects with Vitamin C and glutathione makes for a robust and powerful trio of antioxidant therapies. Nasal Ozone: Ozone gas held in the sinuses helps your body more effectively uptake oxygen and activates a healthy immune response. Ozone should not be inhaled as may damage the lungs.

And fortunately, Flatiron Functional Medicine is certainly not the only place that you may be able to receive these powerful therapies to support the immune system. Many other providers have the resources and training to deliver them as well – so please seek out a reputable and trusted clinician in your area to learn more about these options.",fake

The publications pointed at open data showing increased mortality in Moscow and St. Petersburg last month compared to previous Aprils.

The Russian Foreign Ministry attacked the newspapers on Thursday, accusing them of ""disinformation,"" and demanding retractions. Russian lawmaker Vasily Piskaryov also demanded the publications be stripped of their press accreditation.

Russia has the second highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world after the United States, with more than 262,000 confirmed cases reported as of Friday. The country's official death toll, however, remains lower compared to other hard-hit countries: 2,418 COVID-19 deaths have been reported by Russian officials.

According to government data, Moscow registered over 1,700 more deaths overall last month compared to its April average over the past five years. The New York Times pointed out that that total is much higher than Russia's official coronavirus death count of 642 in Moscow for April.

The Financial Times reported a similar spike in total deaths reported in St. Petersburg in April, suggesting that the country could have 70% more coronavirus deaths than officially stated.

Neither publications have met the foreign ministry's demand for a retraction.

Moscow's Health Department reacted to the press reports on Wednesday with a statement saying that more than 60% of deaths among the city's coronavirus patients are not being included in the official virus death toll because their deaths resulted from underlying causes. Officials said autopsies are being conducted in all suspected coronavirus deaths, and defended their methodology as ""exceptionally precise.""

Russian officials have also claimed that the large scope of testing contributed to low mortality, allowing the detection of infections at early stages. According to the Russian healthcare watchdog, Rospotrebnadzor, 6.4 million COVID-19 tests have been done as of Friday.",real

To defeat a lethal enemy, we sacrifice freedoms, limit contact with others, surrender financial security, and restrict ourselves from things we would like to be doing, in service of the greater good of saving lives.

It strikes me that the same thing was happening around this time 57 years ago.

Opinion

On April 16, 1963 (Good Friday that year), 50 courageous individuals chose to be commanded by the government to remain in place; they did so to combat a pernicious, nation-ravaging evil that had taken countless lives and seemingly knew no borders. Led by Martin Luther King, Fred Shuttlesworth and Ralph Albernathy, these peaceful protest marchers were incarcerated by Bull Connor. They intentionally remained in jail, eschewing bond, to combat the deathly evil of racism.

From that very Birmingham Jail, Dr. King would pen his rightly famous letter. He challenged us to pay attention to what his moment made clear, bringing to the surface the problems already present.

“We bring [racism] out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. … Injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.”

Dr. King taught us that racism must be exposed. In the age of COVID-19, racism certainly has been exposed as a stubbornly infectious and lethal American virus. Racism is combining with the coronavirus to double the damage inflicted upon African Americans.

We learned last week that people of color are dying disproportionately of the novel coronavirus. While some sing the chorus “the virus knows no color”, African Americans are dying of the disease at alarming rates: people of color constitute 42% of COVID fatalities, but only 21% of the national population. Here in Chicago, the statistics are more stark: 70% of coronavirus deaths have found victims in our African American community.

The injustice has been exposed is that both COVID-19 and racism are killing the black community in Chicago and throughout America. This is not the bias of petty personal prejudice, but racism entrenched in American institutions: the legacy of intentional racist policies that led to tragic disproportions in housing, educational opportunities, food availability, employment prospects, and wealth generation.

Racism kills. It killed through the master’s whip. It killed through lynchings. It killed through the KKK. It kills through mass incarceration, with Cook County Jail serving as the worst current example. But racism also kills through the continuing effects of centuries of American policy that are every bit as lethal.

Yes, we are seeing death by COVID-19. But we are also witnessing death by racism. And through our history, racism has a much higher and even more tragic body count.

Fifthy-seven years ago, Dr. King did more than shelter-in-place to combat racism; he went to jail.

I imagine Dr. King might be encouraged to see all we are sacrificing to counter COVID-19. But I know he would also challenge us with this question: if we are willing to sacrifice to fight one deadly disease, what will America muster finally to combat the lethal virus of racism?

Americans have proven this month that, even without strong centralized leadership, we can unite to combat a pernicious killer. We can combine individual effort with state leadership and unprecedented federal investment to overcome a menacing threat.

Once we defeat the coronavirus, the time has come — and the road map has been drawn — for us as a nation finally to defeat the plague of racism.

Sorrento Therapeutics skyrocketed as much as 244% on Friday after the company said an antibody it was developing showed ""100% inhibition"" of the COVID-19 virus in preclinical studies.

The small biotechnology company said it planned to ""generate an antibody cocktail product that would act as a 'protective shield' against SARS-CoV-2,"" the official name of the novel coronavirus.

Sorrento said it would ask regulators for ""priority evaluation and accelerated review"" of its antibody candidate. The company added that it hoped to receive government support and partner with a pharmaceutical company to scale up manufacturing of its candidate if clinical studies find it to be successful.

Over the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration granted two malaria drugs ""emergency use authorization"" for the treatment of COVID-19. The move makes it easier to add the medicines to the strategic stockpile, which can be drawn upon in the current public health emergency.

The drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — have been identified as potential COVID-19 treatments based on lab tests and small, limited studies in humans.

But gold standard clinical trials in the United States only just got underway. Preliminary results from those studies aren't expected for weeks or months.

One thing is for sure, the FDA decision doesn't reflect an official determination that the drugs work against the coronavirus.

""This is not FDA approval of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19,"" says infectious diseases physician Rajesh Gandhi, who is leading Massachusetts General Hospital's COVID-19 treatment task force. ""There's an epidemic of misinformation out there, and we need to combat that.""

The emergency use authorization only applies to the supply of these two drugs in the Strategic National Stockpile, the government's storehouses of emergency medical supplies located in warehouses throughout the country.

Hospitals would need to request access to the drugs through their states, and the medicines would only be distributed to patients who have been hospitalized and tested positive for COVID-19, but for whom a ""clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible,"" according to the FDA.

""It's nice to know that they have it in the event we're running low or going to run out,"" says Onisis Stefas, chief pharmacy officer at Northwell Health in New York, where doctors are already using the drug for patients who can't be enrolled in clinical trials. ""It's good to have this as backup.""

The emergency use authorization won't affect patients seeking this drug from their local pharmacies, where shortages have been reported.

Sandoz, the generic and biosimilar arm of drugmaker Novartis, donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the stockpile. Bayer Pharmaceuticals donated 1 million doses of chloroquine. The Department of Health and Human Services announced on Sunday that it accepted these doses ""for possible use in treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials.""

President Trump began promoting both drugs at his daily coronavirus press briefings earlier this month, prompting a spike in hydroxychloroquine prescriptions and concern about shortages and accidental poisonings.

If the drugs were helpful, doctors would be pleased to have a treatment option.

""We were told patients with COVID-19 who received this drug cleared the virus better than patients that did not receive the drug,"" says Francois Nosten, who directs the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit in Thailand and has been working with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for decades. ""But it's not sufficient information to be sure that this drug can be used or should be used in treating patients more widely.""

Preliminary findings often don't pan out.

""The whole history of infectious disease is littered with drugs we all thought were going to be promising but turned out ... not to be,"" Mass General's Gandhi says, adding that some of these medicines even turned out to be harmful.",real
1653,565,https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/05/remote-career-technical-school-covid-19-pandemic/611047/,2020-05-02,"Shop Class, Over Zoom","CTE is one of the few areas of public education that has consistent bipartisan support among federal lawmakers, and it’s also favored by the public in national education polls. Massachusetts is one of a growing number of states boosting its investment in CTE: In recent years, it has distributed more than $78 million in grants to help expand CTE programs, including more classroom seats to accommodate students training for high-demand jobs.

The district has the resources for Essex Tech to adapt relatively quickly to remote learning; the school provided students with laptops or iPads at the start of the academic year, and administrators say they’ve been able to help families in need get access to mobile hotspots for internet service. The school’s leadership team also put together a thorough blueprint detailing processes and expectations for students and staff while distance learning is the norm, something teachers and parents say has eased the transition.

Not every CTE school will have the same supports to fall back on, Jarrod Nagurka, a spokesperson for the national Association for Career and Technical Education, told me. But CTE’s emphasis on creative problem-solving could help students and teachers adjust more swiftly to this new reality, Nagurka said. “We’re seeing an incredible amount of resourcefulness,” he said.

That’s been the case for Massachusetts’s CTE community more widely, which has responded rapidly to the remote-learning situation, Kevin Farr, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators, told me. Teachers from the state’s 56 vocational programs are sharing lessons, video lectures, and ideas for activities. “We’re going to provide a solid bank of online resources from all over the country, as well as the state,” Farr said. “We have to fill that gap until we can get our kids back to school, and back to the hands-on piece.”

In the meantime, being forced to adapt to distance learning means that schools such as Essex Tech have a chance to reimagine how CTE is taught, which could be a boon for communities where the cost of building and outfitting specialized schools is an issue or for rural areas where in-person classes aren’t possible. “Necessity does breed invention, and this situation we’re all facing certainly qualifies as necessity,” Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, told me. “We’re very eager to watch what kinds of solutions people come up with and what kind of evidence we can collect to see which approaches work better than others.”

For Benouardia, the Essex Tech freshman, the forced transition to remote learning has been both challenging and rewarding. Her classroom is now the two-story house that she shares with her parents, three siblings, and grandmother. The family’s internet service has slowed down considerably with more people at home, and for some classes the workload is heavier than when school was open. There have been perks, too, such as setting her own schedule, and assignments like the litter survey. “That was the best homework I’ve ever had,” Benouardia told me. “I learned a lot from it about my neighborhood and the people who live around me. That’s going to stick with me.”

Nightlife looks completely different these days.

Bar patrons have taken things into their own hands -- shaking up cocktails at home, ordering booze from an app, turning up Bluetooth speakers to listen to a virtual DJ on Instagram live, maybe even while Zooming with friends.

But can that ever fully replace elbowing up to a crowded bar, chatting up a bartender and everything else that comes with a night out?

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.

The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.

""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""

Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.

""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.

Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.

""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.

""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""

""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.

Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.

Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""

A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.

Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.

""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""

Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""

""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""

Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""

""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Slate, a multi-floor lounge and nightclub with multiple bars and hundreds of hands-on games like pool and ping pong, has catered to Manhattan's lively late-night crowds for over 20 years. But it could struggle welcoming back customers at a 6-foot distance.

Owner Aristotle ""Telly"" Hatzigeorgiou told ABC News, ""We're adjusting as best we can.""

The owner's plan for a return to operations will eventually include ""strict sanitation guidelines that will be followed between each use, and we'll make sure all tables, chairs and games are spread apart enough that people can safely socially distance themselves.""

A gust plays pool at Slate in New York City in an undated photo, before the coronavirus pandemic. Slate

He added: ""Temperatures will be taken at the door. Hand sanitation stations will be placed all over the venue, and markers will be placed both inside and on the sidewalk outside for any line that may form to ensure guests stay 6 feet apart while we check IDs, take temperatures and check coats.""

Hatzigeorgiou plans to take full advantage of the sprawling 17,000-square foot, two-floor space. ""Once restaurants are given the OK to open in NYC,"" he said, ""we can start to open some parts of Slate.""

For bars with live music, like Howl at the Moon in San Antonio, COVID-19 could silence the big, bustling crowds that scribble down song requests and pass the papers up through the bar to the stage.

Denise Ramirez, a musician who plays piano at the hopping venue on the San Antonio Riverwalk, told ABC News that after three years there she has a different perspective for what a new normal could mean.

""Howl is typically a packed house, especially on weekends when we get a lot of bachelorette parties and birthday parties booking up tables,"" she said.

The music-centric bar has 14 different locations in the U.S. and has to keep track of ""all the different regulations being put in place by different state and local governments,"" Ramirez explained. ""I can only assume that's only made it more difficult for them as a company to figure out what they're going to do.""

""Their plan is to wait until bars can open at a full capacity or near-full capacity, because in their words, 'Howl has to be Howl,' which makes sense to me,"" the pianist said. ""I've been part of a now-closed Howl establishment in New York City and have seen what happens if it tries to remain open for only five people on a Tuesday. And I think it's the right move.""

Ramirez and the other entertainers, bartenders, servers and door attendants were furloughed, and she thinks they will ""wait quite a bit before reopening,"" even with the state of Texas currently reopening restaurants at 25% capacity. ""The return to nightlife is going to be a mixed bag. I would expect lots of excitement from everyone having cabin fever, but I'd also expect quite a few rules in place.""

""I don't think anyone wants to be singing on stage with masks on,"" Ramirez said about a discussion with her fellow musician friends. ""We turn to nightlife to escape from our problems, so having a reminder of the pandemic onstage in front of us would kind of defeat that purpose.""

Matt Damon and his family are self-isolating in the small seaside town of Dalkey in Ireland.

Since Dalkey is not used to hosting A-list celebrities, the actor has become the talk of the town. Damon agreed to an interview on an Irish radio show, ""Fully Charged,"" where the hosts asked him to surprise a fan who just happens to be a nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus battle.

To kick off the interview, Damon explained that he was in Europe filming a movie when production moved to Ireland but then shut down due to coronavirus.

Rather than fly home, he and his family chose to stay put in Dalkey, and they've been there for about two months now.

""I don't know if you're fully aware that the Dalkey people are protecting you like a glorious gem,"" radio host Nathan O'Reilly told Damon during the interview.

Locals have even created a Facebook group to track Damon — and he's aware of it. ""That's when I realized how great this place was and how protective everybody is here,"" Damon said. ""I had no idea this was happening behind the scenes."" O'Reilly admitted joining the group to try and find Damon for the interview.

The reason Damon agreed to do the interview was because a famous friend convinced him to. U2 singer Bono lives nearby, and while the pals can't see each other face to face due to social distancing rules, they have been FaceTiming. On one call, the Irish singer told Damon: ""You know, there's a local radio station that's looking for you.""

""That was the final impetus for me,"" Damon said. ""I was like, 'I really got to check those guys out and call into the show.'"" The hosts were absolutely delighted that Bono helped facilitate the interview, which they conducted with Damon via video conference.

Damon called Dalkey ""incredible"" and one of the most beautiful places his family has ever been. ""Obviously what's going on in the world is horrible, but for my family, it timed out right,"" Damon said. ""I'm with my whole family and I have my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks. So we have what nobody has, which is live human beings teaching our kids.""

Damon knows this is a luxury for parents in a time of remote learning. He's also grateful that in a time when travel is limited, he's stuck in a picturesque place.

Damon said while most of his family is together in Ireland, his eldest daughter, Alexia, from his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso's previous marriage, is in college in New York City. She and her roommates had COVID-19 ""early on,"" Damon said, adding ""she got through it fine,"" and she will reunite with the rest of the family at the end of the month.

Of course, the hosts couldn't end the interview without asking Damon about ""Contagion,"" the prescient 2011 film about an uncontrollable pandemic. ""You're oddly prepared for this because you were in 'Contagion.' Life is literally imitating art now,"" host Graham O'Toole said.

Damon said has spoken to screenwriter Scott Burns and some of the people who consulted on the movie about the current pandemic. ""Anybody who says you couldn't predict this, just look at 'Contagion.' I mean, 10 years ago we made a movie just by talking to experts and asking them how this would look and how it would kind of go down,"" Damon said.

""The whole thing is just tragic and sad. I hope some good can come out of it. Luckily, this isn't as lethal as it might've been, so maybe this is a dry run for the big one that might come along, because these things do come along every few decades,"" he continued. ""Best to be ready for it.""

To end the interview, the hosts had Damon surprise a nurse who asked if there was any way she could see him. The nurse, Anais, who is from France but lives in Dublin, was shocked to see Damon join the video conference. ""I just can't breathe at all,"" she said.

Damon thanked Anais for all she and other frontline workers are doing. ""I feel like that is the one thing to come out of this — we will never ever ever look at you guys the same. And that's a good thing,"" he told the nurse.",real

Already we're seeing warning signs: businesses that could stay closed despite the economy reopening, businesses not feeling confident enough to invest, and state and local government not being able to bounce back.

There is a way to prevent the slow growth problem: Congress needs to pass more stimulus.

George Pearkes is the global macro strategist for Bespoke Investment Group.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

US economic activity has started to bounce from its COVID-19 recession lows, but focus on short-term improvements ignores the pain that could stick around for years to come.

A wide variety of high-frequency data indicators from airport passenger volumes to demand for gasoline to applications home loans have all bounced as Renaissance Macro economist Neil Dutta wrote last week, and companies are also reporting encouraging trends in late April through early May.

That's good news, and a sign that the combined support from Congress and the Federal Reserve has prevented the worst-case scenario, while the gradual reopening of the economy allows for some consumer activity that wasn't feasible before.

Taking a step back, however, reveals a deeply concerning picture.

A lesson from the financial crisis

From 1947 to 2007, per capita real GDP of the US economy rose very predictably and steadily over time by about 2.2% per person per year.

But following the last global crisis, instead of returning to that steady trend, output shifted to a lower gear. CUNY economist JW Mason has identified the huge difference between the old trend and the new one as a policy failure that could have been avoided.

That shortfall in real GDP has huge consequences over the long-term. By the fourth quarter of 2019, it meant the standard of living (roughly proxied by the level of GDP per person) Americans enjoyed was over 20% lower than it would have been if the country returned to its post-World War II, pre-2007 trend.

The concern for the US economy now is not whether easing lockdowns lead to more activity than during the depth of the lockdown, but whether the climb in economic activity returns to the pre-pandemic trend or not.

Returning to the post-2009 trend is much easier than to the pre-2008 trend; it requires just 1.6% per person real output growth per year, lower hanging fruit than the 2.2% from pre-crisis.

But there is a lingering question about whether the country can achieve that relatively modest goal.

There are three primary reasons.

The destruction of small businesses

First, the permanent closure of businesses, especially small businesses. A team of economists from the University of Chicago published a paper last week that suggested 40% of job losses through April were thanks to permanent business shutdowns.

When businesses close, workers can get re-hired elsewhere and owner-operators can find new sources of income, but the process of re-hiring and finding new income is slowed relative to if the business simply re-opens its doors. Therefore a bounce-back in activity may be slowed by fewer businesses being able to reopen.

Weak investment

Second, capital expenditures. A huge range of companies ranging from tech giants like Facebook or Microsoft to oil producers like Exxon Mobil or Occidental have reduced their planned capital expenditures — investments in big ticket items like new facilities or equipment — for 2020.

That foregone capex is both lost income for suppliers of companies, but it also means that future economic gains from that new equipment or factory are lost.

Weak post-financial crisis capex was one widely-cited reason for slow growth. The economy never saw investment rise above 5% of GDP in the last cycle (net of depreciation), which is usually the low point during previous recessions.

Low investment and low growth are a mutually reinforcing cycle — if there is low growth then companies are less likely to feel comfortable spending on big projects, but the lack of this capital investment then limits the ability of the economy to grow. This vicious cycle has kept growth low following the last crisis and we may be on that path again.

Hampered state and local governments

Thirdly, state and local governments are running out of funds to support their citizens.

Most state and local governments have some form of mandate to run balanced operating budgets, so when tax receipts fall, outlays must as well. These governments cut a million jobs in April (70% of which were education-related) and will continue to shrink their workforces as long as sales and income tax receipts lag.

Ongoing contraction from governments, who are crucial employers and economic actors, will weigh on the whole country's economic bounce.

Potential good news

While this may seem quite gloomy, there are some offsetting factors.

The stock market's recent bounce is actually good news for capex. Rising stock prices send a signal to management teams that they can continue investing in their businesses, and the recent pop in prices is likely to reassure businesses that the coast is clear.

Second, the US is projected to run a budget deficit totalling roughly 12% of GDP this year, with billions of dollars in stimulus checks, lots of credit to keep businesses from shuttering (including PPP loan/grants and Fed lending programs), and big top-ups to weekly unemployment insurance checks.

If businesses don't actually shutter thanks to PPP and other programs, and if consumers are being provided enough cash to spend when they're able, it's possible the economy can return to the pre-coronavirus trend; that's what a BlackRock analysis from April suggests will happen.

But the biggest way to ensure the US economy bounces back is further federal government action. More stimulus in the form of cash distributions to households would lead to higher demand that gives businesses a reason to invest more than they otherwise would, and state and local government budget holes can easily be filled by the federal government via new legislation.

A new relief package unveiled on Tuesday by House Democrats does much to fill the gap, offering more cash distributions to households and plugging holes in state and local government operating budgets.

Taking these steps would help sustain the trajectory of growth into a true V-shape that returns US output to the post-2008 trend or even better starts a path towards the higher, post-war trend which we've been below for so long",real
1667,1961,https://theduran.com/dr-fauci-taken-to-task-as-covid-19-narrative-swings-wildly-again-video/,2020-05-23,Dr. Fauci taken to task as COVID-19 narrative swings wildly – again [Video],"Anybody who has been following the story about the coronavirus pandemic is hopefully aware of the constantly changing double, triple, quadruple and n-speak that the “experts” give us concerning the need for social distancing, wearing masks, not touching each other, and in America, especially about not being together in “non essential” places like… church. All of this has been more or less led and spurred on by one Dr. Anthony Fauci. We reported three weeks ago on some rather amazing accounts suggesting that this doctor was somehow connected to the research programs in a “chimeric virus” containing strains of SARS, HIV and other goodies to produce a supervirus – one that is incurable. That research program was ongoing in the United States before the government got wind of it and shut it down, rightly so, since it was a program designed to bring about nothing but death. However, the allegation goes, Fauci managed to channel money illegally to Wuhan, China, to a lab there to further the research, and it is that virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, that we all have come to know and roundly hate.

So goes the allegation. It seems like wackadoo conspiracy theory still to me, but there is some interesting detail behind it, so it is possible that there are at least several true elements. However, Dr Fauci works for President Trump on the Coronavirus Task Force, and of late, the President has been ignoring the good doctor’s “for your own good” advice more and more. On Friday, May 22, the doctor did a reversal from his long-held course that we must be isolated until the end of time (and our media controlled) and suggested that isolation for too long may do “irreperable harm… including to our own health.”

Yeah. We knew that already. Ask anyone who has been riding this thing out in their home for the last two months. Do you feel better now? Now, granted, we have done a lot to adapt to the present pandemic, but the rhetorical churn and froth over how this is being handled, and how and what the virus itself does is such that for the last week or two, it has been extremely difficult to know what to report on here. The only constant about COVID-19 seems to be the never-ending stream of unqualified nonsense (we have stronger words for that, you know) that have everyone who tries to stay informed jumping and paranoid… or, has them finally coming to the conclusion that seems to be true:

Nobody really knows.

It would be okay if someone, anyone, in leadership said this honestly and continuously, as a preface for trying to establish some sort of common ground. We know less about COVID-19 than the experts act like, and the increasingly political nature of the handling of the pandemic is far more dramatic than the pandemic itself has turned out to be.

The video included with this article shows the response of one entertainer, Dave Portnoy, who has been skeptical of Dr Fauci’s position for a long time. After Dr. Fauci suddenly whipsawed to a different point of view (in truly Orwellian splendor, without acknowledging he was wrong), Dave does not let him get away with it.

If nothing else, the video ought to help all of us blow off some long-built-up steam.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti lambasted US President Donald Trump on Thursday for appearing in public outside of the White House while not wearing a face mask.

Speaking to MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, Garcetti was asked about Trump's avoidance of protective face covering.

1671,458,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-general-motors-coronavirus-ventilators-medical-supplies/,2020-04-27,How Ford and GM joined the fight against the coronavirus,"This past week another 4.4 million Americans joined the unemployment line, and among the companies shedding the most workers are America's carmakers. The ""big two"" – General Motors and Ford – built nearly 4 million vehicles here in America last year, today they are making exactly zero; their factories closed to prevent the coronavirus from spreading among employees.

While they are no longer making cars, both GM and Ford are applying their manufacturing muscle to the pandemic by turning out ventilators and personal protective equipment in huge numbers. Last week we spoke to GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford executive chairman Bill Ford remotely, both of them were in Michigan, and they told us they're thinking creatively to figure out how to get their workers back on the line and keep them there.

Bill Ford: We're shut down pretty much everywhere in the world except China right now. And then, of course, we were shut down in China earlier. And we've never had a time like this where everything has been shut.



Norah O'Donnell: I know that Ford reports its first quarter earnings in a few days and the projection is a loss of $2 billion. And those losses will continue to mount. Can you sustain that?

Bill Ford: Well, obviously, not indefinitely.

Between them, Ford and General Motors had nearly $300 billion in revenue last year. Today, that river of money is running dry.

Mary Barra is CEO of GM, the first woman to run the company in its history.

Norah O'Donnell: Has COVID-19 proved to be an existential threat to GM's long-term health?

Mary Barra: Between the strength of our balance sheet with the steps we've taken in the past, we will get through this and we will learn a lot of lessons that we'll apply.

Norah O'Donnell: I mean, what's the long-term prognosis for-- for General Motors if you're not making cars?

Mary Barra: No one knows-- when things are going to get back to what I refer to as a new normal. I've heard others refer to it as the new abnormal.

Mary Barra, CEO of GM

In the ""new abnormal,"" GM and Ford have each tapped into about $15 billion in private lines of credit to pay their bills. One estimate is that Ford is burning through $165 million dollars a day. Remember, it was just 11 years ago, in the last financial crisis, that GM declared bankruptcy. Ford avoided that, but did get a $6 billion government loan.

Norah O'Donnell: So do you think you'll need another loan to get through this crisis?

Bill Ford: We don't think so. We think we can get through this. And we think we can get through it and get back to work. But we're in an unprecedented time. And so I suppose you never say never. But that's not our plan.

Part of the financial pressure is that under their contracts with the United Auto Workers union, Ford and GM continue to pay millions of dollars to their idled workers.

And now there's political pressure, with protests taking place in their home state of Michigan, and some demonstrators demanding an economic restart.

Norah O'Donnell: What do you think's driving those protests?

Bill Ford: I think people are-- are understandably nervous, scared-- scared about the disease, but also scared about their own economic well being. And so I mean I get it. I totally get it.

Norah O'Donnell: Many people in your state want to get back to work soon.

Bill Ford: Well, I think we'd all like to get back to work soon. But we have to do it safely. And that's not a political question. That's really a scientific question.

Bill Ford

As Ford and GM shut down auto production in March, Michigan emerged as a major COVID-19 hot spot. The state has the third largest number of deaths in the nation, and its health care workers have endured shortages of protective gear. The state's largest health system, Beaumont, says that 1,500 of its employees are presumed to have COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: What were your marching orders to your team when this crisis began?

Bill Ford: My team didn't need marching orders. Right from the very start, it was from our local hospital saying, ""Hey, we don't have any protective equipment, who can help us,"" our company just jumped into action.

And that began Ford's transformation from carmaker to medical supply manufacturer. The company has since churned out millions of face shields, masks, gowns, and portable respirators for health care workers. This past week, ford began producing ventilators for patients.

Bill Ford: There are companies that can make complicated things, but they make them in small numbers. There are also companies that can make lots of things, but they can't make complicated things. You know, we turn out an F-150 every 52 seconds. So when we look at this crisis-- as a country and said, you know, ""Which industry is positioned to help us not only in terms of sophisticated machinery, but can do a lotta them and a lotta them quickly,"" the auto industry is uniquely positioned to do that.

Ford workers manufacturing medical supplies

In mid-March, it looked as if American hospitals would quickly need thousands of ventilators that didn't exist.

As the pandemic spread, GM's Mary Barra learned about a small innovative ventilator manufacturer in Washington state called Ventec.

Norah O'Donnell: Was putting the company's assets and people to work, to fight this pandemic an easy decision?

Mary Barra: It was a very easy decision. When I got the call and we got the introduction to Ventec the team just moved so quickly. And we thought if there's a way we can help, we absolutely want to do it.

After one phone call with Ventec, Phil Kienle, GM's vice president of North American manufacturing, got on a plane with three of his engineers.

Phil Kienle

Phil Kienle: When we were on the flight to Seattle, I asked everybody to have a mindset of what if your parents, your wife, one of your children had this COVID disease, and absolutely needed one of these ventilators? How far would you go to get this thing into production? How fast would you move?

Norah O'Donnell: And given the speed with which you needed to act, how did you go about sourcing 400 different parts for ventilators?

Phil Kienle: Our global purchasing and supply chain team really pulled off a miracle in sourcing this. We were in Seattle on a Friday. That same weekend, they were already sourcing the components for us.

GM and Ventec began transforming GM's Kokomo, Indiana, facility virtually overnight, from one that made electronic car components to a ventilator factory. It was ideally suited because both products contain a lot of circuit boards.

Then they called on a mixture of salaried GM employees and union workers from the UAW.

George Vandermeir

George Vandermeir has been with GM for 43 years. He used to make sure parts for pickup trucks met safety standards. He's doing the same now for ventilators, with parts so small they need to be picked up with a set of tweezers.

Norah O'Donnell: When were you scheduled to retire?

George Vandermeir: Yesterday. So I just extended my retirement for another month or two just to make sure this gets off the ground and everything works well so we can get these ventilators out.

Tracy Streeter used to move sheet metal with a forklift at his old GM job. That was before he was laid off because of COVID-19.

Tracy Streeter: And just brought that plant to a standstill.

He is one of 46 laid-off workers from a GM plant in Marion, Indiana, who got the call from Kokomo.

Tracy Streeter: I went and asked my wife. She's an LPN. And her eyes lit up and she went, ""You get to help."" So it was a no-brainer.

Norah O'Donnell: Your wife is a nurse and she said, ""This is an opportunity to help.""

Tracy Streeter: Exactly.

Tracy Streeter

In just two days he was trained to assemble and test a part of the ventilator that holds oxygen and has to be airtight.

Tracy Streeter: There's a little tiny screw that goes into-- the part that I build. But even though that screw is so small, it's an important part. I look at it in the scheme of things, I'm just probably just as insignificant as that small little screw. But I play a part in what's happening in the bigger scale.

Phil Kienle: It went from a discussion to production in less than three weeks.

At first, GM and Ventec were operating on their own. In late March, President Trump ordered them to make ventilators under the Defense Production Act. Twelve days later they signed a half-billion dollar contract to make 30,000 for the federal government by August.

GM says it's not making any profit on the ventilators, but the project is teaching the company valuable lessons to help get its car factories open faster, says Phil Kienle, head of manufacturing for North America.

Phil Kienle: Well, we've actually pretty much used-- Kokomo as a beta site, if you will, for new safety protocols that we'll instill when General Motors restarts.

Norah O'Donnell: That's really interesting. So not only are you making ventilators, you're also learning about how to work safely in this new era once you reopen the car plants.

Phil Kienle: Absolutely.

Norah O'Donnell: Many of those working on Kokomo, Mary, told us that they get their temperature taken before they go into work. Is that going to be the new normal in American manufacturing?

Mary Barra: Yes it will be. And before I walked into this facility today I had my temperature scanned. I think it's-- a very important part of the protocol.

Bill Ford: In the plant I'm in today-- we're wearing face masks and we're wearing face shields.

Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the company has also installed plastic barriers between each workstation to enforce social distancing.

Bill Ford: Everybody's also wearing watches that buzz if you get within six feet of somebody else.

Norah O'Donnell: That's the first I had heard about these wristbands that buzz when you get within six feet of somebody.

Bill Ford: Yeah, we're trying it out.

The watches that Ford is testing are made by Samsung and use bluetooth technology.

Bill Ford: It also tells you who you've come into contact with that's also been wearing that-- that-- wristband, so that if anybody was infected, it's very easy to trace who they were interacting with.

Ford is testing the watches with small teams of workers now making medical equipment.

Norah O'Donnell: And what do you do when it buzzes?

Joanne Ritchie: Back off. (LAUGH)

Joanne Ritchie

30-year Ford employee Joanne Ritchie is on a line that's made over a million face masks. Just six weeks ago, in another ""clean room,"" she was making transmission valves.

Joanne's daughter, Andrea is a critical care nurse in one of the hospitals near Detroit that has seen both shortages of protective gear and multiple staffers diagnosed with COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: And when your manager called to ask if you would come back not to make cars, but to make face masks, did you think about your daughter and helping her?

Joanne Ritchie: That was the first thing that came to my mind. I thought, ""I'm gonna protect her. If I can, I'm gonna protect her. I'm gonna give her what she needs to do her job.""

Joanne Ritchie goes to her job at the factory every morning at 4:30 a.m., seven days a week. About an hour after she leaves for work, her daughter heads for her job at the hospital, to treat COVID-19 patients.

Joanne Ritchie: The first couple days that she came home, she was-- you couldn't even look at her in the face. She didn't wanna talk. And I says, ""I'm worried about you. I'm-- I'm waiting to make sure that you come home at night (CRYING) 'cause I don't know if you're gonna come home.""

Norah O'Donnell: She really is on the frontlines.

Joanne Ritchie: Oh yeah, she is. Sorry about that. (LAUGH)

Turns out, it runs in the family. During World War II, Joanne's grandmother, Chiara worked for the Hudson Motor Car Company in Detroit, helping to make planes and engines for the U.S. war machine, just as millions of other women did in factories all around the country.

Norah O'Donnell: Your grandmother Chiara was a real Rosie the Riveter.

Joanne Ritchie: Yes, she was. You just step up to the plate.

GM's George Vandermeir also stepped up. The first shipments of ventilators he helped build went out to Chicago area hospitals last week.

Norah O'Donnell: When you first saw a ventilator built and completed, ready to ship, how did that make you feel?

George Vandermeir: It was amazing. What we could do in such a short period of time, taking a vision and making it reality in three or four works. And we all got that opportunity to sign the box of the first shipments.

Norah O'Donnell: Worth putting retirement off for?

George Vandermeir: Absolutely. Hands down, no question.

Some business shifts seem like natural moves — restaurants offering takeout, venues livestreaming concerts or retailers scaling up online sales.

Businesses that are based around gathering people together for a tour, a game, travel or a conference are finding new ways to get money coming in the door.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours can't load up buses of strangers to take them on a tour of Milwaukee these days. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements make it nearly impossible. Even with the easing of restrictions, it's unknown when the general public will feel comfortable gathering again.

The company started receiving phone calls for cancellations as soon as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. By the next day, more than $200,000 in business was canceled or refunded, said company owner Theresa Nemetz.

""Within 48 hours, I realized we were completely out of business unless we pivot,"" Nemetz said.

Can these stores survive?:Can these 13 retailers outlast coronavirus?

Lost Penney? J.C. Penney says it plans to close nearly 29% of stores – or 242 locations – as part of its bankruptcy

Coming up with a new line of business was the only way Nemetz could keep paying her five-person full-time staff and continue to call part-time workers.

The idea was to bring the sights and tastes of Milwaukee to customers' doors with care packages. Instead of taking people through the city for sausages at Usinger's and pretzels from Milwaukee Pretzel Co., Milwaukee Food & City Tours is packing those items up (along with virtual tour experience access) and shipping it out.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours started in late March with quarantine care kits and shelter-in-style kits.

Nearly 2,000 care packages have been sold. The move is sustaining Nemetz's business. She has not had to furlough staff members. She also received federals funds through the Paycheck Protection Program.

The selection has expanded with specialty care packages for events like birthdays, Mother's Day and Cinco De Mayo. The kits vary in price from around $35 for a chocolate self-care kit to $78 for the ultimate snack break.

Milwaukee Food & City Tours is thinking about offering tours again to private groups with guides leaving adequate distance and talking through headsets. But it's also thinking about how these care packages can become a lasting part of the business.

""For the next couple of years, it's possible that some individuals won't be able to do a tour,"" she said. Instead of having travelers visit Milwaukee to learn about the city, she'll ship the experience to them.

Marla Poytinger isn't sure when her company will be able to bring 1,500 people through her bars for ax throwing, mini-golf, shuffleboard and painting again on a Saturday night.

The live, host-led trivia game her company launched during the pandemic will remain part of Bars & Recreation Inc.'s business line after bars open.

""Even if the world goes back to normal, which I don’t think anyone expects, there is still a huge market of people who ... still need to gather and interact but can’t or aren't willing to come together physically,"" Poytinger said. Public games are $9 per registration, which can include all the people quarantined together.

The company, which runs Axe MKE, Splash Studio, NorthSouth Club and Nine Below, is seeing maybe just 1% of its normal revenue, she said.

Many businesses like hers would lose all their revenue unless a new product could be sold.

Daniel Cruz was launching his new laundry service for Airbnb hosts, Washbnb, as the pandemic halted travel. The company faced a total loss. Cruz thought about shutting down, but laundry still needs to get done, even during a pandemic.

Washbnb shifted gears to offering services to people who are elderly or immunocompromised in the Milwaukee community, charging around $10 to $20 a load with delivery. The company is also offering a pay-what-you-can model. It is operating at a loss and actively looking for investors to raise $450,000.

Nearly all the trade shows that BoothCentral Inc. works with to manage vendors are canceled for the foreseeable future.

""No events are collecting vendor payment,"" said BoothCentral co-founder Tim Gill. ""We had to pivot or we would be at a standstill.""

BoothCentral's development team built a new platform out in 10 days to replicate the experience of an in-person trade show. This is not just a live stream. The virtual event page contains a main livestream and vendor rooms, among other areas, with the goal to replicate the buzz of an in-person event.

It held its first virtual event in the middle of April.

""We didn't go into this thinking it would be extended this long,"" he said. ""But we just knew that we had to do something.""

On its new platform, BoothCentral is hosting art fairs, home and garden shows, and career fairs. The company is now growing and hiring to add to its staff of 10 employees. Even once in-person events are held again, BoothCentral anticipates hybrid models with online components.

""There is no going back to normal at this point,"" Gill said. ""We see that this is going to be the new way.""

1684,1937,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-trump-orders-churches-worship-to-reopen.html,2020-05-23,President Trump orders houses of worship to reopen … threatens to override states that refuse,"(Natural News) President Donald Trump has declared places of worship, such as churches, synagogues and mosques, as essential services and has called on governors to allow these religious institutions to reopen. The president has also said he will âoverrideâ the decisions of any state leaders who don’t agree to reopen churches.

âThe ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure their congregations are safe as they gather and pray,â said Trump at a hastily scheduled appearance Friday in the briefing room of the White House.

The president’s order comes as he criticizes the “hypocrisy” of some governors who have allowed liquor stores and abortion clinics to remain open while keeping houses of worship under lockdown.

âItâs not right, so Iâm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential,â Trump told reporters.

In response to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, most houses of worship in the U.S. have closed their doors for the time being, with some providing virtual services. However, others have tried to continue with normal services and bringing their congregations together, which has prompted some pushback from local authorities. (Related: Churchgoers vow they would rather DIE than skip services during coronavirus lockdown.)

State and local officials critical of order

Trump made no mention of how exactly he would compel governors and state authorities to reopen religious institutions. Currently, legal experts are saying that the president has no power to compel state governments, especially if the order to shut down places of worship was done lawfully.

State and local politicians have similarly expressed resistance to this order.

Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo said she will not alter her state’s lockdown protocols to reopen churches. Similarly, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that her city will be ignoring Trump’s demand.

âBy no means can the president order any locality, any state to do something that he doesn’t have the power to do,â said Lightfoot. âAnd he can’t do that here.â

Public health experts have raised concerns about the risks entailed with reopening religious institutions, especially when there have already been several cases of outbreaks spreading from church congregations. A small outbreak of COVID-19 broke out in rural Arkansas which spread from a pastor and his wife to around three dozen of their parishioners. At least two churches in Texas and Georgia have already shut down after reopening when several of their members tested positive for the coronavirus.

Listen to theÂ Health Ranger ReportÂ with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, as he talks about how the lockdowns have been weaponized to the detriment of humanity.

CDC issues guidelines for reopening of places of worship

TheÂ Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÂ (CDC) released guidelines Friday afternoon about what communities of faith should follow if they want to maintain good health when they reopen.

Religious institutions should, above all, establish and maintain lines of communication with local and state authorities, provide proper protective equipment for staff and congregants and abide by local, state and federal laws and regulations put in place to protect everyone.

Once churches reopen, the CDC laid out seven key guidelines they need to follow:

Follow social distancing regulationsÂ — Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas.

— Limit the size of gatherings and consider holding services in large or outdoor areas. Encourage the use of face masksÂ — Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow.

— Both staff and congregants should wear face coverings, especially when social distancing is difficult to follow. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation effortsÂ — Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly.

— Develop a proper schedule when employees will clean and disinfect all frequently touched surfaces in the building. Increase ventilation in the building and ensure that the church’s current ventilation systems are working properly. Promote healthy hygiene practicesÂ — Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

— Encourage both staff and attendees to practice proper hygiene, such as the washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Provide childcare services for congregantsÂ — Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area.

— Consider opening proper childcare services, or partnering with nurseries in the area. Minimize the sharing of worship materials and other itemsÂ — Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items.

— Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of materials, such as worship aids, prayer books and other items. Train staffÂ — Train both clergy and staff in the above-mentioned guidelines.

The CDC further stated that, during these troubling times, faith leaders should continue providing congregants with spiritual and emotional care and counseling services.

DespiteÂ these guidelines, it remains unclear if Trump can force state and local authorities to reopen houses of worship. The U.S. Constitution reserves considerable powers to states and several courts have already set restrictions on in-person worship services during the pandemic for the promotion of public health.

J.B. Pritzker was urged Thursday to relax his five-step plan to re-open Illinois — by allowing restaurants to open at 25% capacity on June 1 with strict safeguards for their employees.

Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said without changes, Pritzker’s plan would have a devastating impact on restaurants and bars because it would force them to wait until June 28 at the earliest to re-open to dine-in customers.

Instead, Toia proposed restaurants be allowed to move to Phase 3 on June 1 and relax restrictions every 14 days, instead of waiting 28 days between phases.

“We would have a lot of restrictions. Personal protective equipment. Face coverings. Social distancing. Taking the temperature of employees when they come in to work,” Toia said.

“June 1 is still three weeks away. ... Indiana, Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Tennessee are open. Let’s see if they have a spike. If they do, OK. If they don’t, I would really urge the governor to look at letting us re-open with 25% or less capacity, then use the 14-day model and, hopefully, by mid-June be at 50% capacity.”

Toia acknowledged restaurants operate on razor-thin margins and “economic models don’t work on 25% capacity.”

But, with restaurants literally fighting for survival, he’s willing to take what he can get.

“If we wait until the end of June, it will be 16 weeks that 50% or more of the restaurants in the city of Chicago have been closed and [the other] 50% are 80% down in sales. I don’t think there is any economic model out there that says you can stay in business” in that situation, Toia said.

“The further we go, the harder it is gonna be for restaurants to re-open. The National Restaurant Association is predicting that 20% of the restaurants won’t re-open. That’s basically looking at the end of May. If we go `til the end of June, it could be 45% or more of restaurants that never re-open. And restaurants are the soul of every neighborhood in Chicago,” Toia said.

“The governor understands the desire to open up sectors of our economy as quickly as possible because he shares that same sense of urgency,” said Jordan Abudayyeh, Pritzker’s press secretary. But, she added, “the state’s five-phase plan was put together by health experts and lays groundwork for how we move forward with a new normal. From day one, the governor has relied on science and data to drive the response to this deadly virus and staying on this course will continue to save lives.”

The governor’s plan has been criticized for being too conservative, moving too slowly between phases and setting too many hurdles to get there.

Although he divided the state into four regions, each authorized to re-open on its own timeline — based on positive test results, hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms and ICU beds and ventilators — no region could move to the next phase without waiting 28 days.

And none could return to normal until there is either a vaccine for the coronavirus or widely available treatment. That means no gatherings larger than 50. No conventions at McCormick Place. No major festivals like Lollapalooza and Taste of Chicago. And no major sporting events with fans in attendance.

Schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms would have to wait until Phase 4 — June 28 at the earliest — to open, and even then would have strict limits on capacity.

Business groups and their allies in the Illinois General Assembly are concerned that, by the time various regions meet those hurdles, scores of businesses already will close for good, taking thousands of jobs with them.

That’s Toia’s argument in a nutshell.

“Governor Cuomo has been at the forefront just as much as Governor Pritzker has. But why is New York using a 14-day period to move between phases and we’re using a 28-day period?” he said.

But how willing will customers be to return to restaurant dining?

“If we’re only opening with 25% or less capacity, I think people will come. I don’t think everybody will run out. But enough people will. … It’s all about cash-flow,” Toia said.

A mayoral appointee to the Zoning Board of Appeals, Toia said he has talked to Mayor Lori Lightfoot “and her team” about his plan.

“The mayor wants to see what the governor is gonna do. But the mayor is trying to be very progressive with us. There’s communication going on about maybe closing some streets for outside dining with the tables on the street. That way, we could have social distancing,” Toia said.

“There’s no question that she wants to think outside the box about how we help these restaurants throughout our 77 communities stay viable as we move ahead.”",real

Police had to intervene after a small group of about 120 counter-protesters, many of them clad in black hoodies, repeatedly ignored police requests to stay clear of the ‘Vigil for the Basic Law’ rally against the lockdown measures on Saturday.

The counter-demonstrators, who showed up unannounced, lacking any permission from the authorities, argued that the anti-lockdown rally attracted many right-wing extremists. “Against conspiracy fantasies, anti-semites and the right-wing agenda,” one of the posters read.

Although both rallies ended without a major incident, scuffles broke out between police and counter-protesters. A bottle was hurled at the officers from the crowd, police said. One person was arrested but was released later.

The anti-lockdown gathering was greenlit to go ahead after organizers agreed to cap the number of its participants at 750 instead of some 3,500-4,000, as originally requested. The Hamburg Administrative Court ruled to limit the number of those who could join the rally so police would be able to enforce the social distancing guidelines, imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic.

Less than 20 minutes after the meeting officially kicked off, at about 3:17 p.m. local time, the maximum allowed number of participants had already arrived, police said, noting that it had to block more people from coming.

The demonstrators stood several feet apart from each other, chanting slogans and holding anti-lockdown banners, some of which read: “The right to distance instead of a ban on contacts,” “Free accessible tests for everybody instead of the quarantine for everybody” as well as “Stop the corona madness! Basic law now!”

The participants of the rally denounced the government’s response to the outbreak, which has seen some 177,850 testing positive for Covid-19, including 8,216 who have died as a result of the disease.

One of the speakers at the rally argued that more people have died due to planned surgeries being postponed than from the virus itself. There have also been calls to make future vaccinations voluntary, although the authorities have never said that the coronavirus shot would be mandatory.

Several dozen rallies for and against the lockdown measures were also held in Berlin, including outside the Reichstag building, home to the German parliament.

That gathering also prompted a counter-action, with demonstrators branding those opposing the coronavirus restrictions “tin foil hats” and “Nazis.” Some 1000 police were deployed to ensure social distancing. In the wake of the protests, some 180 people faced administrative and criminal charges for violating the restrictions, including The Infectious Diseases Protection Act, police said.

1698,1637,http://sputniknews.com/columnists/202005211079376803-us-pirates-of-the-caribbean/,2020-05-21,US Pirates of the Caribbean,"You have to be amused at this headline: “US masses planes at Japan airbase to show foes and allies it can handle coronavirus,” reports Reuters.

So, let’s get this straight. At a time when the US is leading the world with deaths and infections from the disease, the Pentagon views flexing muscles with warplanes in the Asia Pacific is somehow a demonstration of American potency.

While the American public is crying out for more resources to cope with the pandemic, Washington sees fit to ramp up militarism not just in the Asia Pacific, but also in the Arctic region, the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean.

US warships despatched to the Caribbean are said to be on a mission to counter-narcotic trafficking. Few people will buy that pretext. The military force is deployed as a threat to Venezuela and its socialist government which the Trump administration has openly targeted for regime change.

A failed coup attempt earlier this month involving a private US mercenary outfit may or may not have had official support from the White House.

But one thing is clear: when Russia proposed a statement of support for Venezuela at the UN Security Council this week in which the failed coup was denounced as a violation of the UN charter forbidding aggression, the draft statement was “killed” by Washington’s envoy.

The implication is that Washington’s public position sees nothing wrong with aggression despite the flagrant violation of international law that it involves.

In that case, it could be expected that the US will attempt to block Iranian oil tankers en route to Venezuela. If aggression is acceptable to Washington then why not also a bit of high-seas piracy?

Five Iranian-flagged tankers are due to dock in the South American country in the coming days. They are reportedly ferrying $45 million worth of gasoline to alleviate Venezuela’s crippled economy as it struggles like many other nations to control the coronavirus pandemic.

Venezuela is a major exporter of crude oil but due to US sanctions its capacity to refine fuel has been decimated. This has caused severe shortages for Venezuelan transport which has, in turn, exacerbated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Both Venezuela and Iran have warned the US to not interfere in the sea passage of the oil tankers. Both countries have been burdened with American sanctions, but they are legally entitled to conduct bilateral trade. If US warships impede the transport, then it will be viewed by Venezuela and Iran as an act of piracy. We might add that the rest of the world will view it that way too. An act of piracy compounding acts of economic aggression under heartless US sanctions.

Given the pandemic crisis, Iran’s supply of vital fuel to Venezuela is not merely a normal trade transaction, but a courageous act of solidarity and humanitarian aid.

The Trump administration has mischievously indicated it will do something to stop the Iranian ships reaching Venezuela. What that something is open to guesswork. Will it use its warships in the Caribbean to mount a blockade?

Iran has warned it will retaliate. Perhaps by attacking American warships in the Persian Gulf, where skirmishing has already taken place.

Venezuela says it is sending naval forces to escort the Iranian tankers once they arrive in its territorial waters.

In the next coming days, a showdown awaits which could have explosive repercussions, not least because the Iranian tankers are reckoned to contain 1.5 million barrels of gasoline.

The US head of Southern Command, Admiral Craig Faller, this week played down the probability of an armed confrontation with the Iranian vessels.

He is quoted as saying: “You have to ask yourself what interest Iran has in Venezuela, where we have seen recent indications of Iranian military and state support?”

Eh, let’s guess Admiral Faller, maybe simply an act of solidarity by two nations who are under the boot of American imperialism and illegal sanctions that amount to a crime against humanity.

American global power right now is seen as a farce. It has been devastated by a virus and shown to be a lying cheat over its attempt to smear China and the World Health Organization. Its sanctioning against nations struggling with a deadly disease is barbaric terrorism; and while millions of Americans are facing poverty, the US is sending warships and warplanes to all corners of the world.

Washington won’t dare do piracy in the Caribbean at this juncture. Because it can’t afford another fiasco. Its global image is already in tatters.

1700,369,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/magazine/oakdale-federal-prison-coronavirus.html,2020-04-18,‘Something Is Going to Explode’: When Coronavirus Strikes a Prison,"
The Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, La., is the site of the first fatal coronavirus outbreak in the federal prison system. F.C.C. Oakdale — which houses some 2,000 inmates and employs close to 500 staff members in two low-security prisons (Federal Correctional Institution Oakdale I and F.C.I. Oakdale II) as well as a minimum-security camp — provides the economic lifeblood for a town of fewer than 8,000 people and the surrounding parish. Many of F.C.C. Oakdale’s inmates are serving sentences for nonviolent offenses, like drug sales and financial fraud.
The Bureau of Prisons maintains that it began preparing for the coronavirus outbreak in January. On March 26, Attorney General William P. Barr advised Bureau of Prisons officials that certain “at-risk inmates who are nonviolent and pose a minimal likelihood of recidivism” might be released to serve out their sentences in home confinement, under terms included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
On March 28, Patrick Jones, 49, who was serving a 27-year sentence at Oakdale for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, became the first federal inmate in the country to die from the virus. On April 3, Barr ordered federal prison officials to speed the release of “vulnerable inmates” from at least three federal institutions fighting major coronavirus outbreaks, including F.C.C. Oakdale. By the third week of April, seven Oakdale inmates had died. At least 100 inmates and staff members had been infected, with more than 20 hospitalized, as confusion, fear and anger gripped the interconnected community of inmates, officials, workers, family members and loved ones.Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity. Several correctional officers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Alice Jones, Patrick Jones’s mother: I talked to him in March — he always called me once a month — and I told him, “I love you, baby,” and he said, “I love you, Mama.” And that was the last time I talked to him. He was not sick. No sniffling, no coughing, nothing.
Correctional Officer 1: Me and another staff member took out an inmate to the hospital. We took him out on a Thursday [March 19]. We were told, “Oh, he has asthma.” It’s routine to take inmates that have health issues out on emergency medical trips. He said he was short of breath, couldn’t breathe. They gave him a mask. We weren’t offered any kind of protection.
Ronald Morris, correctional officer, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1007: I got a phone call saying we had an inmate go out with Covid-19 symptoms. And yeah, they told the staff he had asthma, and I think it was even on the paperwork that he had asthma, but then they sent him out with a mask. So, hell, yeah, it was very disturbing that they sent the inmate out with a mask and didn’t provide it to staff.
Correctional Officer 1: We checked him into the emergency room, and about an hour and a half later, they moved him from a regular E.R. room to a negative-pressure room, and that’s when they had us put masks on, but I’d already been around him without a mask on. No one told us he might have Covid-19. They said, “Hey, he got asthma issues.” Two days later, I got a call telling me he’d tested positive for the virus.
Alice Jones: They lied. He did not have a longtime chronic illness. No asthma. He did 100 push-ups a day.
Christopher Walker, Patrick Jones’s son: I didn’t know about it until my grandmother called me at like 1 o’clock in the morning. I don’t see how it just took him down like that.
Claudette Crumpton, Patrick Jones’s former girlfriend: He was as healthy as a bull. I always heard in prison the doctors don’t properly take care of them. If they fill out a piece of paper saying they sick, they wait a couple of days to get permission to see the doctor. And then they wait until they get damn near to their deathbed.
Ronald Morris: We found out that Jones tested positive for Covid-19 on the 21st. That’s when we locked down both institutions. And we had our second confirmed case that day also. He went to the hospital. On the 22nd, both C.O.s who took Jones to the hospital were cleared to return to work.
Correctional Officer 1: I got a call telling me I was on administrative leave. And then seven hours later, roughly, a supervisor calls and says, “Y’all are good to come back to work.” I was upset. I mean, you already know you’re exposed to it, but you know, got to pay the bills.
Gene Paul, the Republican mayor of Oakdale: I knew about that first inmate who went to the hospital and tested positive, and I knew that a corrections officer had transported him without a mask. But I didn’t know that his wife and daughter work here at City Hall. When I come to work Monday morning [March 23], his wife tells me that her husband was that correctional officer. I was like, “What?!” I sent them home and said not to come back for 14 days.

On March 28, nine days after being admitted to the hospital, Patrick Jones was pronounced dead. The federal Bureau of Prisons claimed Jones had “long-term, pre-existing medical conditions which the C.D.C. lists as risk factors for developing more severe Covid-19 disease.”
Don Cain, inmate at F.C.I. Oakdale I, via email: I will tell you how I heard the virus got in. I was told that a staff member from education bragged about going to New York City. The first death of an inmate was a guy who was in contact with that staff member. I heard that staff member was supposedly in critical condition in the hospital on a ventilator.
Wife of an F.C.C. Oakdale correctional officer, via Facebook Messenger: There’s also a rumor saying an inmate came off the bus as a new intake, and he brought it in.
Mayor Paul: As of last week [the week of March 30], they were still bringing inmates in from other facilities. It took them about a week to stop those buses. There was a lot of the ball being passed around with, “It’s not my responsibility, it’s the marshals’ responsibility, it’s not our responsibility, it’s somebody else’s.” Well, whose responsibility is it to stop this? I mean, I love the B.O.P. being here and everything, but you think you would have taken some precaution 10 or 14 days earlier to be halfway ready for this thing, especially when you got about 2,000 inmates and about 500 employees.
Correctional Officer 2: I know there was a conversation with the warden. It was myself and one of the case managers that I used to work with — who tested positive, by the way, he’s been out for a week, week and a half — he questioned the warden and said, “What do you think about this coronavirus, do you think we’re going to have a problem?” And he said: “Oh, no, because we live in the South, and it’s warm here. We won’t have any problems.” That was his exact words. Nobody gave us new direction on what we should be doing, how we should be preparing, what to look for, anything.
Ronald Morris: We tried to talk to the warden about safety protocols. I’d say as early as March 18 we talked to him about cross-contamination among the staff. We suggested we keep staff contained and not let them work between institutions. But the warden said he didn’t think that was needed at this time.

Oakdale prison officials including the warden, Rod Myers, did not respond to multiple detailed requests for comment.
Kirk Brannan, recently released from Oakdale prison camp: What happens is that the correction officers and administrators come and go between the facilities and between us and the civilian population. So if any one of them gets exposed, then they’re going to expose us.
Ronald Morris: I’d brought up in our daily meetings that the staff going on medical trips needed P.P.E. But it took them several days to issue N95s, so at first they wore surgical masks. Then the guys did have N95s, but we had not been properly trained to make sure we are doing this properly. And at times there have been shifts they would go work without being protected at all. On March 25, we had six inmates in the hospital for Covid. Each inmate requires two staff to watch him per eight-hour shift. On March 26, we had three confirmed staff with Covid-19.
Mayor Paul: We’re a close-knit community — everyone knows everyone, so there is a lot of concern and uncertainty. About 50 percent of the people in the surrounding area work at the prison, and the ones that live in Oakdale, they go to work, and then they go home and back into the community, go to stores, that kind of thing. When that first inmate tested positive, I called the warden, but he hadn’t returned my calls. Now I have people calling in asking me questions about what’s going on, and I couldn’t really tell them anything because I didn’t know anything. People just want to hear something. Just like, “Everything’s going to be OK,” or, “I spoke with the warden, and he said they’re working on this and everything’s going to be OK.” But I didn’t really have that information. So I called up my state representative, and he was getting calls about some of the same things, and the warden had never returned his call either. And then he called our U.S. congressman, Mike Johnson’s office, and Senator Bill Cassidy.
Ronald Morris: Our warden said he was writing the playbook. I cannot tell you how many times I heard the phrase that we were “writing the playbook” for the B.O.P. to handle this kind of thing when it reached other facilities. I mean, if we were writing the playbook, we were in a ditch.

Mandatory daily temperature checks of every inmate began on March 26. To house sick inmates, prison officials converted half a housing unit in Oakdale I to quarantine inmates who had been exposed to the coronavirus or were exhibiting symptoms.
Don Cain, via email: A guy they brought over to our pod had a cough. I had no symptoms whatsoever, and neither did the other four guys in my pod, but they told us to pack up, we were going to quarantine. I for sure thought I was next to die, as I have diabetes, and they say that having diabetes, it’s the one that is the hardest to fight the virus. I just knew they were going to stick me in there with someone who was sick, and I would contract it and would not be able to fight it and pass away. I was praying, asking God not to let them take me over there to that death unit.
Correctional Officer 3: We got three inmates getting tested to see if they had the virus, and we put them on a range, which is a straight hall that got cells. I fed those guys. I wore gloves. I didn’t wear masks. I didn’t think they had it. But turns out all three of them tested positive. And they went out to hospitals. It was just a wake-up call for me.
Correctional Officer 1: It took a little while to wrap your head around that it is a big deal. Then probably Thursday [March 26], I went to sit on one inmate at one of the local hospitals, and they gave us the little yellow paper gowns to put over our uniforms, and the N95 masks and gloves and goggles. But the nursing staff were coming in like they were about to take a spacewalk — the helmets, you know?
Ronald Morris: We had inmates at four local hospitals. At the hospital 40 miles away, they have a suit they wear with the helmet. Our staff don’t. I think half of a whole floor is negative pressure. At another hospital, we got patients in a regular I.C.U., and we sit outside a glass partition so we can observe the patient. They also have some inmates in regular rooms, and the staff are sitting in the room with them. Those are not negative pressure. At one hospital, staff had N95s, gloves and gowns. The health care workers have on the same thing. There are two negative-pressure rooms, and you sit in a vestibule and observe the inmate through the glass wall. The inmate is restrained to the bed, so if something happens to the inmate, we got to go in and remove restraints.

On March 27, five plaintiffs, including three employees at F.C.C. Oakdale, filed a class-action suit on behalf of all federal employees claiming that since Jan. 27, they had “performed work with or in close proximity to objects, surfaces and/or individuals infected with the novel coronavirus,” and asking for hazard pay.
Anita Kadrovich, correctional officer: For probably over a year and a half or so, my job was to take inmates to their medical appointments. I have rheumatoid arthritis; it’s an autoimmune disease. So I do low-dose chemo every week, which wipes out my ability to fight off anything. I have no immune system. My doctor told me I should not be around any of it. He sent me a letter. But I didn’t turn the letter in. I didn’t want to leave my people stranded — it’s like leaving a man behind.
Ronald Morris: Jones died on the 28th, and by then, we probably had up to about 12 inmates in the hospital, and another confirmed staff with Covid. On the 29th, we had seven confirmed staff. Then it just hit the accelerator, and it went fast. You had inmates going to the hospital by ambulance, two or three a day. I was pleading with the warden for help — we just didn’t have enough staff. And we were forcing staff to work 30 or 40 hours straight.
Kirk Brannan: At the camp, there’s two large dorms filled with bunk beds stacked end to end, three feet apart widthwise. So when you’re sleeping on your bunk bed, you’re within three feet of 12 people snoring and breathing hard. So there’s a lot of common breaths going on in there. It’s the epitome of an environment that can spread the virus if any one person gets it.
Ronald Morris: On March 30, we had 15 inmates in the hospital with Covid. We had seven positive staff and 16 staff out awaiting tests. On the 31st, we had 17 inmates in the hospital and eight staff positive, with a lot of people awaiting results. Then the second inmate died on April 1, and by then we was running. First we had 10 positive staff. At noon that day, we had 13 positive staff. By 5 o’clock that evening, we had 17 positive staff. It was very chaotic and stressful. Most of the guys that tested positive were either working in the housing units or sitting on Covid-19 patients in the hospital. In the housing units, they were only wearing surgical masks. They say if you work in an isolation unit, you must wear an N95, but where do you think these inmates are coming from? They’re coming from a housing unit where they won’t give you that mask. That’s our biggest bitch. How is it that you don’t wear the N95 mask where the symptoms originate from? If an inmate gets sick in this area and lives in that area, you don’t wear a mask, but if you put him in an isolation area, you wear a mask.

On March 31, the Bureau of Prisons ordered a 14-day lockdown across the federal prison system: “Inmates in every institution will be secured in their assigned cells/quarters to decrease the spread of the virus.” The lockdown permitted inmates in small groups to use the phones, computers, showers, commissary and laundry facilities.
Kirk Brannan: They have the camp inmates making sack meals, bag meals, for those who are on lockdown. They’re going on three and a half weeks of living on bologna sandwiches and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. That’s all they get to eat for dinner or lunch. They get a little packet of cereal for breakfast. Inmates at the camp are making those bags, and we don’t know if anybody infected is making those bags or not. They’re not testing. You would think if you have a potential of having an infection, you’d have to be tested before you get to handle people’s food. Well, that’s not being done.
Ronald Morris: We have, as of about an hour ago [on April 2], 20 staff who’ve tested positive for the virus. We probably got that many out at home waiting on test results. And that changes hourly. We have approximately 18 inmates in the hospital. We got approximately 40 or so inmates in isolation; these inmates are showing symptoms of Covid-19. We got over 80 inmates quarantined that have been exposed. Both of those numbers are growing daily. I am in the community hospital working, and I’m looking at the inmate through glass in the bed. He’s sleeping. I hope he doesn’t die on my shift.

On April 2, an inmate at the minimum-security prison camp who was exhibiting symptoms was tested for Covid-19. Anita Kadrovich had been transferred to work at the camp a few days earlier.
Anita Kadrovich: We thought we were fairly safe out here, but no. When the first inmate got sick, people started looking around and started getting worried. You could just tell on their faces. Everybody was like: Oh, my gosh, it’s here. I felt the same way. When they came out to quarantine the first inmate, they had their hats on, they had their N95s on, they had the surgical mask over their N95. They had the gowns on, they had their feet covered, everything.
Correctional Officer 2: That same day, I asked the acting health-services administrator for an N95 mask, and she told me I didn’t need one. At the same time, she and all three of the nurses that were with her had on full protective gear. But I was told the surgical mask that had been provided was good enough. And that wasn’t the first time that we here at the camp had been denied. We’d requested masks two other times and were told, “You don’t need it.” They never gave us a reason other than, “Well, until there’s a positive case,” and now they tell us they aren’t testing because they assume if someone has symptoms, they have it.
Anita Kadrovich: And right after the first inmate was taken to quarantine, they called for safety to come out and decontaminate the health-service department. The safety guy told me that when he walked into the health-service department without his mask on, they were like: “No, no, put your mask on! That inmate was all around and in here!” So I’m like: “It was that serious for y’all, what about all of us? He was in our offices cleaning our doorknobs. Do we need to be decontaminated?” But they didn’t tell us any of that.
Correctional Officer 2: That inmate was one of our orderlies, so he was walking around without a mask every hour cleaning every door handle in the entire camp. He’d exhibited symptoms the previous week. He’d had a fever. And we requested the protective equipment, but they wouldn’t give it to us because they said we didn’t need it. They had a little dust mask, like a painter’s mask, and a pair of gloves that they would give us, but it’s nothing.
Anita Kadrovich: I feel like we’re guinea pigs.Kirk Brannan: Everything they’ve done has been really kind of the opposite of what they should have done. I can’t tell you how many guys, when I was leaving, came up to me and said: “Please get our story out there.” Something’s got to happen before something catastrophic happens.
Ronald Morris: You got the director of the B.O.P. saying they’ve been preparing since January, and they have a national stockpile of supplies. Well, where the hell are those supplies? Why can’t we get some? They did send us some national-stockpile N95 masks. Want to know how many? Two hundred! Two hundred! They couldn’t afford to give us any more. They know that we’re just the first institution that’s going to be dealing with this, so they need to hold it to ration it out to other institutions because they know their national stockpile is insufficient to begin with.
Heidi Burakiewicz, lead attorney on the federal class-action lawsuit: What I am constantly hearing from workers at Oakdale is that they’re looking for guidance, and they’re getting no guidance or contradictory guidance, or it’s constantly changing. I’m outraged when I hear people tell me: “I rode in a van with a sick inmate, and I asked for a mask, and they said: No, I didn’t need it.” Or: “I sat in a room in the hospital with a sick inmate, and I didn’t even have a mask on.” Or: “It was only a surgical mask.” That makes me angry. That was preventable. Somebody in this agency needs to take responsibility and start protecting these people.
Ronald Morris, via text, April 3: Five inmate deaths. Eighteen inmates in hospital, 727 inmates quarantined in five housing units. Two staff in hospital.
Don Cain, via email: A guy from our unit passed away. I did speak with him on a daily basis, so that hit home to actually know someone who was alive just last week and he is no longer here.
Correctional Officer 3: Inmates get sick with the coronavirus, and they don’t want to say anything until it’s so bad that we got to rush them out on the ambulance so they don’t die. We had one guy, he was about to die, and his cellmate waves over the corrections officer, and he was like: “Hey, uh, this guy’s not doing so well.” And then they had to put him on oxygen and rush him out to the hospital. He just laid in his bed, and he didn’t want to go to another unit, and he didn’t want to go to the hospital. All the inmates are scared because they don’t know what’s going to happen if they get it.
Don Cain, via email: People are scared and worried. They ask questions and complain, but we are told half-truths, kept in the dark.
Ronald Morris: We’ve had staff working 24 to 32 and 40 hours of overtime. You don’t have nobody to come relieve you sitting at the hospital, and inmates is going out left and right. We’re 50 minutes from the institution, so you got at least an hour’s drive. I had an officer that got to work at 6 that morning and volunteered to work at the hospital to relieve a staff member so they could go home. Ended at midnight and never got relieved, drove back to the institution because he had another shift to pull there and fell asleep three times on the highway. We cannot abandon the hospital post that we’re on or abandon the security that we’re providing for that inmate because we’ll face disciplinary action. We all take an oath to protect the public, to protect the institution, to protect each other and government property. We have a no-strike clause in our union contract. We’re bound by an oath kind of like the military to protect and serve.
Correctional Officer 2: Originally, they gave us a form, and it asked if you’d been exposed, if you had any symptoms, if you had seasonal allergies, how long you had seasonal allergies. Now all they’re doing is checking our temperature. You pull up, they put a little forehead thermometer and check your temperature: “OK, you want a mask and gloves? Go on in.” No “How are you feeling? Do you have body aches, are you nauseated? Do you have a cough, a runny nose, any of that?” We’re not questioned at all.
Anita Kadrovich: At 99 degrees, they clear you to come in. So you could have symptoms, and you could have been undetected.
Ronald Morris: If they let everybody self-quarantine, there ain’t nobody to work in the prison, and the bureau is not going to do that. So they’re going to make the excuse of “We’re doing enhanced screening to catch it, come back to work.” That’s their answer. Is it the right answer? Hell, no, it’s not the right answer. But what is the right answer? You know, where do you get the help from? I had to pressure the warden to ask for temporary-duty staff to come and assist us. Our national union was telling us that they had people in the regional office ready to assist us, and I asked him if he knew about it, and he said no, and he said: “I don’t know if we need them.” And I said: ‘‘We need help! We can’t keep going at this pace. Will you ask for help?’' I had to ask him two or three times. They started showing up late March.
Mayor Paul: I spoke with the warden on Saturday [April 4], and I mean, this guy sounded like he was fixing to explode. You could hear it in his voice, I mean, exhaustion. I feel sorry for him. He just said it’s been such chaos out there for the last couple of weeks.
Correctional Officer 3: I’m not one of the people stuck working in the medical unit. If I was, I’d be worried every day. We’ve had staff members get sick because of having to work at the hospital for so long.

Since the outbreak began, a number of correctional officers who believe they were exposed to the virus say they have requested extra sick leave to self-quarantine but have been denied. Those who have taken time off anyway risk being designated “absent without leave” by their supervisors.
Correctional Officer 2: A memo is done saying a staff member was placed on AWOL because of “abuse of sick leave.” And that’s what they consider it. If you miss more than three days, you have to have a doctor’s note. And then when they place you on AWOL, the memo goes to the warden, and well, this warden, he refers every single case for disciplinary. The common thing is you get like three days without pay, if you abuse sick leave, and then it just climbs from there. I think one staff member spent 10 days without pay for abuse of sick leave.
Anita Kadrovich: A woman I know, she’s a single mom, and they mandatoried her to go work where all the quarantined inmates are. She broke down and cried because she just thought that was her death sentence. She has two girls, and she was like: “I just know I’m going to get it.” But she went. She sucked it up because that’s what we do. Can’t cry in prison. It’s harder for us women than it is as men, because we’ve got to show that we can do the same job they can do. And it’s mostly a man’s world inside the prison, so as women we have to suck it up and do everything just like the men do. And crying is not an option.
Jordan Cain, Don Cain’s daughter: We live in Wyoming, and, you know, we don’t know anything about Oakdale or anything like that. I know my dad, I feel like he’s scared. He hasn’t called me today [April 3]. So I’m a little worried already ’cause that was kind of one of his things, like, to make sure he calls us every day so we know he’s safe. He did have a heart attack last year. I mean, I am a little nervous right now.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 5: Twenty inmates placed among four local hospitals. Seven inmates in I.C.U. Four on ventilator. Twenty-one staff positive.
Kirk Brannan: The most important thing to me right now is to try to help some of these other guys get out. And I think the tools are in place to do that, if people who can exercise the tools will do so. I think the issue is the B.O.P. is a big bureaucracy. And like any typical bureaucracy, when something comes up that has to be done, it just takes some time to get it done. And because of that, they’re ignoring the severity of the emergency. The first guy left about five days before me; he had filed a petition for compassionate release a year ago. He’s 72 years old, has some health issues. I’m 66.
Don Cain, via email: Do you know anything about the CARES Act? I know I should qualify for what I hear are the standards.
Anita Kadrovich: They have let a few out on compassionate release. So a lot of the older inmates — the majority of our campers are older, and they all have medical issues — they are panicking. They’re doing anything they can to get their paperwork in to do compassionate releases, and case managers are getting overwhelmed with all the paperwork coming in for that. Families call and ask if we can pay for them to be furloughed or in a hotel room or let them come home, and I have to say it’s not my decision.

On April 6, the inmate at the prison camp who was tested for Covid-19 received a positive test result. The following day, a second camp inmate reported Covid-19-related symptoms and was placed in isolation.
Ronald Morris, via email, April 7: The camp is now on quarantine. The warden allowed cross-contamination to affect the camp staff and inmates.
Correctional Officer 2: Right now I’m looking at the front of the unit. And we have a piece of paper on the door where everybody goes in, and it says: “This unit is quarantined. Proper P.P.E. is required.” But all these inmates, they’re all in their dorms. They’re cleaning the floors, cleaning the bathrooms and the showers and pretty much doing their normal routines. I mean, they’re still in the dorm within arm’s length away from each other. On quarantine.
Don Cain, via email: We have no gloves. Only orderlies get gloves, and they wipe down phones and computers once a day, not after every use.
Anita Kadrovich: The community is scared to death of people who work out here. I don’t take it to heart when they turn around in the aisle at Walmart because I have my uniform on and kind of run the other way. I just grab a few things and be gone. I got pulled over for speeding, and the cop found out where I worked at. He backed away from my car and said: “Have a good day!” Southern people, we want to hug everybody. I am a hugger. But no, not now.
Correctional Officer 3: I mean, I completely understand where they’re coming from, but I have never had people like — they’re scared of us. They don’t want to get infected. I try not to go anywhere after work until I change clothes. I just get home, strip, dump everything in a wash and wash it a few times, because I don’t know what I came in contact with.
Wife of C.O.: It is very scary. We have to relive, every day, being scared that my husband has contracted this virus and that he might not be showing any symptoms. We are trying to be very cautious when he comes home. He literally strips down on our back patio, sprays his clothes, shoes, even work bag and hat down daily with Lysol before coming in the house through our sitting area in our bedroom to thoroughly shower. Then he tries to distance himself from us. But it’s so difficult trying to explain to a 2- and 3-year-old that they can’t hug or sit with Daddy.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 8: All of F.C.I. I is in quarantine. And now the prison camp is in quarantine. Forty-five positive inmates in both places. Fifty-three inmates in isolation. Three on ventilators. Six in I.C.U. Twenty-two staff positive. I lost count of staff awaiting results.
Wife of C.O.: My husband is trying to find an urgent care or doctor that will test him. He has a few symptoms but isn’t running a fever, therefore no one will test him. We’ve called several urgent cares and several doctor’s offices, no luck. The E.R. said they changed criteria today to qualify for testing. So we are hoping to be able to get him tested today. He has a cough, and he can’t smell. He said he’s feeling kind of off.
Anita Kadrovich: I should get my test results later today. I have a few symptoms, but it could be my rheumatoid arthritis, because I’ve been off my medicine because it drops my immune system. So to try to build my immune system up so I can continue to work without worrying about catching it. I just quit taking my medicine.
Don Cain, via email: There is still scared people and tension in the air, and you can feel the frustration of being kept inside without going outside except to get your meal. There is a lot of bickering at each other, sense of hostility toward each other like something is going to explode.

On April 8, a violent clash between inmates and correctional officers at Oakdale I occurred after the officers tried to reintegrate a group of prisoners from the isolation unit into the general population.
Ronald Morris: The administration screwed up. These inmates were over the Covid-19 virus, but they weren’t supposed to be released back out there yet, and so when they realized this, they went back an hour and a half later and grabbed ’em and put them back in the isolation unit. And when they did that, that freaked those inmates out because they’re scared of getting this [expletive], and they thought they’d just released the virus into that unit and contaminated them. The problem was, they didn’t educate the inmates on what’s going on. It’s basic corrections 101, communicating with the inmate population. Go down there and town hall them and educate them. They didn’t do that — they kicked ’em out and then jerked them back up, and you think, Oh, hell, they just brought an infected person down here, and now we’re all going to get this [expletive].
Don Cain, via email: I know one thing is, if I do pass, my family has one heck of a suit.
On April 17, a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman responded to a detailed request for comment with a statement: “We want to point out that following a recent visit to F.C.C. Oakdale, the C.D.C. and the Louisiana Office of Public Health commended F.C.C. Oakdale staff and confirmed their compliance with current C.D.C. guidance for Covid management in correctional facilities. We direct you to our public website for detailed information about how the B.O.P. is taking aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of Covid in all of our facilities, including F.C.C. Oakdale.”
Ronald Morris, via text, April 10: Another inmate death — six. Positive inmates: 49. Positive staff: 26.
Correctional Officer 1: You don’t know. This could be the day that you have a temperature. Or this is going to be the day that you come in contact with somebody that’s going to get you sick. Every day when I come home kind of starts my 14 days over, where I can’t have contact with my family. It’s weighing on my wife, and it’s weighing on me. I’m starting to become a little withdrawn and short. I know that my stress rubs on to her and then rubs off to the kids. And it’s not just us. I’m sure it’s the health care providers, I’m sure it’s the local parish and state law enforcement, federal law enforcement, firefighters. I mean, we all probably feel the exact same way. We have no choice.
Mayor Paul: We don’t have a morgue at the Oakdale hospital. They have run in a portable morgue. It’s an 18-wheeler on the loading dock. I understand it is for all the surrounding hospitals if needed.
Correctional Officer 2: We’re still releasing inmates if it’s time for them to be released. When they’re going to leave here, they’re going to get on a Greyhound bus, probably change two or three different buses. One’s going, let’s say, to Houston, one is going to Georgia; we send inmates all over the United States. We send inmates to Puerto Rico. We send inmates everywhere. I have brought up that if we know that they’re getting out, then why are we not putting them in quarantine? Because an inmate could not have a fever 12 hours before he leaves, get on a plane or a bus, and as soon as he gets home, he tests positive. Well, then he’s contaminated all those people.
Ronald Morris: On Monday [April 13], the U.S. Marshals showed up with two what they said were “recovered” Covid-19 inmates and said we had to take ’em. So they’re quarantined. And I was very upset — my next question was: “Are we going to be the Covid-19 hub around here?” And they were like: “No, no, this is supposed to be a one-time deal.” But we’ll see.

On April 15, a seventh inmate died. Twenty inmates were hospitalized. Fifty-six inmates had tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty-two staff members had tested positive, along with three of their family members.
Correctional Officer 2: We just want to be protected. That’s all. My husband works here. And we have three children. I have elderly parents, his mother’s elderly. We don’t want to give this to anybody. And it’s terrifying whenever we hear, you know, somebody else has it, somebody else has it. We live here. This is where we’re from. This is our home.

All L.A. County beaches reopened Wednesday after having been closed for several weeks. Although the beaches themselves are open for active use, the Strand, the Manhattan Beach Pier and beach parking lots remain closed.

Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, police will hike patrols around downtown Manhattan Beach, El Porto, and the Strand in order to dissuade gatherings. They will also direct traffic along the busy Ocean Drive.

""The additional personnel will be responsible for restricting visitor access to the Strand and beach and also help re-direct vehicular traffic in problem areas such as Ocean Drive,"" police said in a news release.

All L.A. County beaches will operate under normal hours, and chairs, canopies, coolers and grills will not be permitted. Sunbathing, gathering and any organized games, like beach volleyball, are also not allowed.

Learning platform edX has launched a free online course on ventilator operation for non-ICU medical professionals being reassigned to ICUs in response to COVID-19.

""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19 "" takes two to five hours to complete.

takes two to five hours to complete. The course was designed in just two weeks by Dr. Susan Wilcox of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in collaboration with Harvard University, edX, and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's philanthropic initiative Schmidt Futures.

Dr. Susan Wilcox of Massachusetts General Hospital and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in collaboration with Harvard University, edX, and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt's philanthropic initiative Schmidt Futures. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" also features a discussion forum where healthcare workers can find support and discuss crucial observations, treatments, and even start regional threads.

Online learning platform edX today announced a new, completely free course on ventilator operation for non-ICU medical professionals being reassigned to ICU units to combat COVID-19.

On top of dangerous shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators, space, and personnel, hospitals also have a critical need for proper training. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" is designed for non-ICU workers who will be joining the front lines in ICUs and other critical care facilities. It was designed by Dr. Susan Wilcox and Mr. Thomas Piraino of the American Association of Respiratory Care in tandem with Harvard and edX, and funded through a grant from Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative co-founded by Wendy and Eric Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman.

The entire course can be completed in two to five hours, and it's free to access. All you'll need to do is click ""enroll"".

What the course covers

The course covers the principles and physiology of invasive mechanical ventilation. Among other things, students will learn how to troubleshoot the ventilator, the specifics of ventilating patients in special circumstances like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Obstructive Lung Disease, and how standard ventilation practices are different for COVID-19 patients.

""There are reasons to opt for early intubation for COVID-19 patients (reduces the risk of aerosolization of the virus), so we are focusing on that."" Harvard University explained in a statement. ""[The course] is more about patient monitoring and treatment options that non-specialists may not be familiar with than the mechanics of operating a machine.""

The minds behind the course

Its architects, Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino, are immersed in the fight against the new coronavirus. Dr. Wilcox is Division Chief of Critical Care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and is leading the team addressing a remarkable influx of COVID-19 patients. Mr. Piraino is the Clinical Specialist for Mechanical Ventilation for the Centre of Excellence in Mechanical Ventilation at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" was borne out of a desire to help their own teams, as well as the thousands of other healthcare workers around the globe who find themselves in exactly the same spot, especially as some cities may be nearing an apex.

A succinct, zero-fee online course is an efficient means for disseminating critical and universally useful information to as many healthcare professionals as possible, regardless of location. And that's why Dr. Wilcox and Mr. Piraino pulled the class together in just two weeks — on top of hours of emotionally and physically grueling hospital work.

""These are my heroes,"" MIT professor and edX founder and CEO Anant Agarwal told Business Insider. ""Actual heroes.""

The course could have a global impact

On top of its immediate usage, edX hopes ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" may prove useful longterm. It has edX's standard feature of a discussion forum, in which healthcare professionals can find meaningful support amongst peers as well as a space to discuss treatments, observations, and even create trends of discussion that may be localized down to country-specific issues. The forum will be moderated by HarvardX and a medical expert who can ""pin"" the most useful questions and answers to the top of the forum for easy reference to good information.

Most edX courses are offered in English, but Agarwal told Business Insider that the company would attempt to make transcripts of ""Mechanical Ventilation for COVID-19"" available in multiple languages now that the company isn't moving at warp speed to get the course out as soon as possible.

""This effort is one of many examples of the type of community collaboration that will be required to combat the spread of COVID-19,"" Mr. Piraino said in edX's April 6 press release. ""As the entire global medical community works together to combat this pandemic, I'm proud to work with Dr. Wilcox to create a course that's universally helpful to all medical professionals in this situation.""

1714,175,https://chicago.suntimes.com/crossroads/2020/3/27/21197436/how-much-longer-inside-jb-pritzker-stay-home-order-rush-northwerstern-loyola-experts-covid-19-virus,2020-03-27,How much longer will we be inside — and then what happens?,"How long will Illinoisans be staying inside because of the coronavirus? Right now, bank on mid-April — at the earliest.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order, which took effect on Saturday, March 21, is set to expire on Tuesday, April 7.

Expect the governor to extend that. Mayor Lori Lightfoot predicted Friday Pritzker would push the order “deep into April,” though Pritzker afterward was non-committal.

Three Chicago medical experts who have been monitoring the situation agree that state public health officials need a minimum of four weeks to make sure that all existing cases of COVID-19 infection in Illinois have been identified and isolated.

Based on the start of Pritzker’s order, that would take the date to Saturday, April 18. Even then, a host of factors could push things back, including the degree to which people can be tested and how full hospitals get.

The experts with whom I spoke are Dr. Bala Hota, an epidemiologist who is vice president and chief analytics officer at Rush University Medical Center; Dr. Elaine Morrato, founding dean of the Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health at Loyola University Chicago, and Dr. Robert Murphy, director of the Institute for Global Health and Center for Global Communicable Diseases at Northwestern Medicine.

While they can’t predict for certain when the outbreak will be under control in Illinois, they do agree on this: Lifting the stay-at-home order should not happen on an arbitrary date such as Easter (April 12), as President Donald Trump has suggested.

COVID-19 symptoms typically do not become apparent until 5 to 7 days after exposure, Hota said. Severe cases on average require hospitalization after an additional 5 to 7 days. Seriously ill patients may remain contagious for longer still.

Criteria for Pritzker lifting the order should include statewide availability of on-demand COVID-19 testing, the experts agreed. There should also be — at minimum — a decline in the rate of increase in daily new cases. Murphy said the number of daily new cases should show a steady downward trend before stay-at-home restrictions are eased.

Another important consideration is how close hospitals are to capacity, Hota said. If the health care system becomes so overloaded that patients do not receive adequate care, more deaths will result from all causes, not just COVID-19.

On-demand COVID-19 testing would require the ability to test at least 4,000 people per day statewide, Murphy said. That’s comparable to the number of tests given per capita in South Korea during the peak of its successful effort to tame the outbreak. The South Korean approach is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 control.

The other experts agreed 4,000 tests per day was a reasonable target.

Pritzker said that, as of March 24, Illinois had the ability to test 2,000 people per day, but expected to be able to test 4,300 per day within two weeks.

As of Saturday evening, Illinois had recorded 3,491 COVID-19 cases, the eighth highest total for any state, including 465 new cases. On average, the number of daily new cases is doubling every three days, Illinois Department of Public Health figures indicate. New cases have been rising sharply since March 9.

In South Korea, new cases rose sharply starting on Feb. 19 and began declining on March 8 — 19 days later, according to data from Worldometer, an international statistics website.

South Korea was able to control the COVID-19 outbreak in a relatively short time because it had ample infrastructure in place due to experience with mini-epidemics such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, Murphy said. South Korea tested up to 20,000 people per day at the height of the coronavirus crisis there.

It also instituted rigorous “contact tracing,” identifying and testing everyone whom infected people had come in contact with through a combination of detective work and technology.

Some public health experts and technologists in the U.S. and other countries advocate the use of smartphone applications and other advanced tools to aid in contact tracing.

South Korea uses a special text messaging service that must be installed on all smartphones sold in that country. If someone tests positive for COVID-19, their path through the community is traced based on information provided by the patient plus credit card transaction location data and security camera video obtained with the patient’s permission.

South Korean authorities have the authority to obtain a patient’s smartphone location data but don’t invoke this unless the patient refuses to cooperate, Ryan Shin, a South Korean who lives and works in Seoul, said in an email. Shin, who graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with an engineering degree in 2012, is CEO of a Korean tech startup.

The service then broadcasts a “safety guidance message” to the phones of all who live in the patient’s neighborhood. The alert overrides other activity on the phone and displays the message accompanied by an audible alarm.

Recipients click on a link to access a page listing the patient’s activities. Shin provided a typical page, shown in the accompanying illustration.

“It says on March 21 she landed at Incheon Airport at 4:30 p.m., took a bus, and rode the elevator in a certain building with a mask on,” Shin said. “On March 22 she went to the hospital for a virus test and then went to the supermarket.”

South Koreans who become ill can use a different smartphone app or visit a website to report their symptoms to a central office, Shin said. The senders receive instructions based on the severity of their symptoms.

Smartphone apps have been developed in other countries to perform similar functions. For example, an app introduced in Singapore uses Bluetooth technology to detect other people’s phones nearby. If a phone owner tests positive for COVID-19, authorities can use the data recorded on the phone to contact others with whom the patient has crossed paths.

The Chicago experts had varying opinions about whether such technology would gain acceptance in this country.

“I never heard of anybody doing it in the U.S.,” Murphy said. “There are a lot of privacy issues. I can’t imagine it happening here.”

“It’s worth exploring,” Morrato said. “It seems like a natural extension of things going on in the private sector that could be redeployed for surveillance. But we need evidence it will make a difference in saving lives as we consider the ethical implications.”

What should happen after the Illinois stay-at-home order is lifted is a matter of debate.

Once COVID-19 is under control in Illinois, it likely will still be raging elsewhere and could easily be reintroduced by visitors. This has occurred in some Asian countries that relaxed restrictions, the experts noted.

Regardless, the U.S. needs to rethink how it deals with pandemics. COVID-19 won’t be the last, the experts agreed.

“It’s not a question of if but when,” Morrato said.",real

We also need to incentivize manufacturers to bring their operations back to the US, especially our pharmaceutical supply chain.

Marsha Blackburn is the first woman to represent Tennessee in the United States Senate.

This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The first quarter results tell the story of an economy under fire. Indeed, American businesses are struggling with an important decision: do we crack the window and reopen our economy? Or, continue to err on the side of caution?

States like Tennessee are leading the way by easing restrictions on local commerce, but business owners remain mired in a fog of what ifs: what if my customers are too scared to leave their homes? What if my employees are too scared to come back to work? What if this financial hole is too deep for me to escape?

Compounding these fears is the knowledge that the existing regulatory state, by its very nature, acts as a barrier to recovery and innovation. For businesses that survive the pandemic, efforts to restart operations will be met with layers of red tape, tax liability, paperwork, and the threat of opportunistic litigation.

When I ask what federal regulations make their jobs harder, with little benefit to be had, business owners can almost always provide a list. Fortunately, the American economy does not exist at the mercy of statutes, even as it functions in spite of them. Congress can and must act now to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulatory schemes.

Since March 5, the Senate has passed four ""rescue"" packages of legislation to alleviate the effects of the healthcare and economic crisis caused by COVID-19. However, those packages were missing permanent statutory reform that owners of businesses large and small would welcome.

Moving forward, we should focus on getting government out of the way, and unburdening business owners, reducing the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse, and promoting private investment and competition. This progress, coupled with sensible liability protections, will allow business owners, hospitals, doctors, and nurses to confidently continue serving their communities, without fear of costly lawsuits.

Shoring up America's economy will also require incentivizing business back to our shores. As we create the environment necessary for manufacturing to return to the United States, we must acknowledge that overregulation is one of the reasons it left.

American workers are facing unprecedented levels of unemployment, but if we invest now in education and training programs, we can recoup outsourced manufacturing and jobs. The bipartisan Advanced Manufacturing Jobs in America Act will jumpstart partnerships between colleges and advanced manufacturers to prepare a new, US-based workforce to take over these roles.

We must also look to specific industries to lead the way, under the guidance of targeted legislation. The global pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in our pharmaceutical supply chain, caused by our dependence on foreign manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients. My bipartisan Securing America's Medicine Cabinet, or, ""SAM-C,"" Act will expand upon existing programs within the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize issues related to national security and critical drug shortages.

SAM-C authorizes $100 million to develop centers of excellence where universities and the private sector will work together to develop new drug manufacturing technology and processes, and train a new workforce. Proposed tax credits for manufacturers who close foreign-based facilities and open or expand domestic ones will sweeten the deal.

The American people are stronger than this pandemic, and they want their leaders to translate that strength into action.

We know the formula for a successful, productive economy. It's time Congress recognized what American businesses are telling us: if we are able to function safely and efficiently under waived regulations during the COVID-19 crisis, we can do so once quarantine is finally lifted.

In a May 4 interview with CNN, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot back with her own assessment of Illinois’ financial straits.

“Look at him saying these states want to be bailed out,” Pelosi told host Wolf Blitzer. “The state that he used as an example was Illinois, which got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there until Gov. Pritzker has come to pull it out.”

The National Governors Association sent a bipartisan letter to Congress in April that made clear the financial pressure caused by COVID-19 is being felt by states nationwide, not just in blue states as Trump has said.

But what about Pelosi’s assessment of how Illinois got itself into a financial bind?

Her comment suggests Illinois’ hardships are a matter of recent history, dating back just a few years to the time of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Republican predecessor. State finance experts say that’s misleading.

Rauner’s role

Understanding what Pelosi was referencing requires a brief detour into recent state history.

In November 2014, Illinoisans elected Republican Bruce Rauner as governor. Rauner, a private equity investor and political newcomer, reached an impasse with Democrats who control the Legislature over how to run the state. That left Illinois without a spending plan for two years.

With government spending left operating largely on autopilot, social services suffered, public universities laid off thousands of employees and the state’s pile of unpaid bills tripled, causing credit rating agencies to reduce Illinois’ rating to near-junk status.

As the state’s chief executive, Rauner played a starring role in the showdown that caused the budget crisis. But he had plenty of co-stars among the state’s leading Democrats, including longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has exerted influence over every state budget for the past four decades.

Democratic leadership also allowed a temporary state income tax increase to expire days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015, leaving the state with even less cash to make ends meet during the crisis. Rauner had urged the Legislature to let it lapse before taking office, and Madigan along with then Senate President John Cullerton obliged despite warnings from then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to Rauner in 2014.

A legacy of fiscal mismanagement

Foisting all the blame for the state’s unprecedented budget crisis on Rauner isn’t the only problem with Pelosi’s narrative. That’s because the tale of how Illinois dug itself into a fiscal hole dates back much further than his single term in office.

When we raised this with Pelosi’s office, a spokesman responded with an email saying she was “clearly referencing the fact that Illinois’ situation greatly worsened” under Rauner — not that he alone was responsible for the state’s fiscal woes.

But experts interpreted her statement differently.

“To claim that this is a problem created by Gov. Rauner is clearly misleading,” said David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois’ Institute of Government & Public Affairs. “It’s a problem that’s developed over decades.”

Illinois governors and lawmakers from both parties have long managed to increase government spending without raising the revenue needed to support it.

“For many, many years we’ve provided more goods and services … than our revenues would support,” said Charles N. Wheeler III, who has studied decades of state budgets as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield. “It’s always easier for lawmakers to fund programs than it is to raise the revenues to cover it.”

Indeed, the alarm bells began sounding long before Rauner took office. A 2011 report from the state comptroller’s office warned of a looming financial crisis created by many years of rampant spending. The report cautioned that the recession at the time had exacerbated the state’s ongoing failures to reduce its debt, build up its emergency reserves, or contribute enough to state employee pension funds.

And when it comes to pensions, Illinois’ problems date back even further. In 1917, a report commissioned by the General Assembly was already warning the funds were “moving toward crisis” due to inadequate payments from the state.

“We’ve been shortchanging the pensions for more than a hundred years,” Wheeler said.

Our ruling

Pelosi said Illinois “got into fiscal problems because of a Republican governor who was governor there” before Pritzker.

Illinois’ financial situation did worsen during Rauner’s term while the state operated without a spending plan for an unprecedented two years, but he wasn’t solely to blame.

Along the cement stars of Hollywood Boulevard, where vendors are normally packed arm to arm hawking maps to the stars, Michael Jackson gloves and the chance to pose with the likes of Johnny Depp, only a single vendor selling masks sat near Ida Lupino’s star hoping for a sale, while the marquee at the El Capitan theater flashed words of encouragement from the likes of “Toy Story” hero Buzz Lightyear such as, “The important thing is that we stick together.”

Further down the street a “Star Wars” stormtrooper looking like he just came off of a movie set skateboarded down Hollywood Boulevard — in the center lane, with no traffic in sight.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no room to skateboard on the sidewalks or the streets anywhere near Hollywood Boulevard, which would be flooded with tour buses and bumper to bumper traffic.

During his press conference, Gov. Newsom said, “At some point in the future, we will need to modify our stay-at-home order. … As we contemplate reopening parts of our state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.”

1731,1566,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-voters-afraid-coronavirus-cast-030045779.html,2020-05-20,"Texas voters afraid of coronavirus can cast mail-in ballots, federal judge rules","Texas voters afraid of contracting the coronavirus can cast their ballots by mail in upcoming elections, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.

In a 74-page decision, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote that the coronavirus pandemic had left the world “without immunity and fearfully disabled.”

The decision came after the Texas Democratic Party and individual voters filed a suit last month arguing that the state’s denial of mail-in ballots during a pandemic was a violation of their constitutional rights.

Only people over the age of 65 and those with a disability that prevents them from voting in person are allowed to cast mail-in ballots in the state.

Echoing a false claim made by President Donald Trump last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Republican, has argued that expanding mail voting would only “serve to facilitate fraud.”

“Mail ballots based on disability are specifically reserved for those who are legitimately ill and cannot vote in person without needing assistance or jeopardizing their health,” Paxton said after a district court ruling last month. “Fear of contracting COVID-19 does not amount to a sickness or physical condition as required by state law.”

But Biery rejected Paxton’s arguments, writing that the state raised the “specter” of widespread voter fraud but offered little evidence that such crimes are happening in states that allow more mail-in voting.

“The court finds the Grim Reaper’s scepter of pandemic of disease and death is far more serious than an unsupported fear of voter fraud,” he wrote.

Any eligible voter who wants to vote by mail to avoid contracting coronavirus can apply for a ballot in upcoming elections, Biery wrote.

Paxton said in a statement Tuesday that Biery’s decision “ignores the evidence and disregards well-established law.” His office plans to seek immediate review by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The decision comes amid a political battle over vote-by-mail during the pandemic. Democrats have largely supported expanding access to mail-in voting, with lawmakers urging party leaders to make it a priority. House Democrats included a provision in the latest coronavirus relief bill that would offer every American that option to vote by mail in the 2020 presidential contest.

Trump, who has voted by mail himself, said the bill was “DOA.”

“If you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, it has a lot to do with elections. We're not going to lose elections because of that,"" he said.",real

An ancient woman, whose pleadings will haunt me to my death, sat in a hallway in a wheelchair endlessly shouting, “Help me! Help me!” with her arms outstretched.

I ran to the nursing station nearby, where many people were busily working but ignoring the patient in need. “That woman needs help,” I barked.

A nurse, nurse’s assistant, attendant or someone in a uniform whose rank I could not identify slowly turned their head toward me from the paperwork they were working on at the time.

Columnists In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.

“She does not need help,” this person said very firmly. “That is just what she does.”

I was convinced that this nursing home employee was a wretched person, as were they all. No feeling individual could turn a deaf ear to such cries of anguish. I walked over to the woman myself and said, “Can I help you?”

“Help me,” the tiny woman cried. “Help me!” There was no further explanation.

Years passed. I grew older. Visited many nursing homes. And eventually placed my father in one.

And one day, that tough old man, that World War II veteran, that survivor of the Great Depression, who as far as I know never asked anything from anyone, was sitting in his wheelchair in a hallway shouting, “Help me!”

“What, Dad?” I asked. “What do you need?”

He looked at me with searching eyes and said, “I don’t know.”

I came to the conclusion that he wanted out. Out of his predicament. Not just out of the nursing home, that wretched place where people wait for the end, but out of his body and out of the muddle that perplexed his mind.

It is a terrible place to be. To live or to work. To even think about.

I suppose that is why so many of us refuse to visit long-term care facilities, even before COVID-19 struck, before there was a quarantine.

I would visit my father every day. But I was usually alone. That didn’t make me better than other people. It did make me a little more mentally unstable during that time, I suspect.

It is said that for most states, a third of COVID-19 deaths are in long-term care facilities. In 14 states, more than half of the virus deaths are in such places.

Political leaders must do something to help our elderly, shriek those with grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, in such places.

And political leaders themselves shout that something must be done.

Yet, we know what these places are. We always have.

They are underfunded. Inspections are haphazard. They are often money factories. They are far too often warehouses, storage facilities, for those waiting to die.

That is not to say we don’t love the people inside. In fact, often we love them too much to see them waste away. It is terrifying to watch such a thing.

And so we leave underpaid, overworked and too often uncaring people to deal with the dirty work. We don’t want to look.

What happens when we don’t look is the same thing that always happens when people turn away. Abuse. Neglect. Incompetence.

There are sometimes angels at work in these places. I have seen them with my own eyes. They care. They pay a personal price I cannot imagine.

But when I hear howls of righteous indignation on this issue from the public and their representatives, I am reminded of the false outrage that erupts following a mass shooting by people who are mentally ill.

We are all standing on the “Help me!” floor listening to the anguished cries. I sometimes wonder if that’s my own pathetic voice I hear joining the chorus.

Editor, Health Impact News

Earlier this month (April, 2020) we reported about the shortages of meats at supermarkets, and how this reflected not a shortage of meat in the U.S., but the failures of our supply chains when a nationwide crisis hits, such as the Coronavirus scare has done.

We discussed how allowing local communities to directly access meat from farmers and ranchers in their own counties and states was the solution to food security issues in our nation’s meat supplies.

See:

The publication Civil Eats has done an excellent job of reporting on these kinds of problems that are systemic within our nation’s food supply chains.

In another excellent investigative report on flour shortages that many are starting to see around the country, Amy Halloran has written an excellent article titled:

Again, as we saw with the meat market, there is currently no shortage of flour in our nation. The issue is the frail supply chain.

Some excerpts from Halloran’s excellent article:

There is no flour shortage in America. Outside the taut supply chains of industrialized food, small flour mills are working double-time to fill fresh flour orders for dedicated fans and a new crowd of bakers. And while these local millers have been around for generations, it took a pandemic to reveal them as alternatives to the dominant grain system. Today, having a relationship with nearby grain farmers seems like a more secure route to bread than it was just a month ago. Industrial milling and factory baking set the standards for what gets grown, and the global marketplace sets the price. Farmers are servants to massive debts they’ve had to take on to purchase equipment, and each year they borrow more money just to pay for inputs, labor, and other expenses. Outside of this industrial baking complex, there exists a world of farmer-cultivated grain systems that not only address the limited choices farmers face inside the conventional system, but also produce delicious, fresh flour, which is generally stoneground and full of the fat and flavor that industrial processing strips away. And it is as different from its supermarket cousin as a tree-ripened peach is from a can of cling peaches. People who are just awakening to the promise of regional grains will be surprised to see just how many exist, how well-rooted they are—and how they’re ready to supply you with grains that will change your life. There are many community grains, produced, processed, and distributed within local and regional value chains that remain intact despite the pandemic. By adapting food systems to a regional scale, farmer-leaders…. are taking risks to better support and care for the land they steward from the ground to the bank. They’re giving consumers an opportunity to buy staple crops that invest in soil health, water quality, and carbon sequestration while offering skilled jobs that employ local folks—on the farm, at the mill, and in craft bakeries. Read the full article here.

When Restaurants Become Grocery Stores

In yet another excellent article published by Civil Eats, Jodi Helmer wrote a report titled:

In our article about Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act and the nation’s meat supply issues, we mentioned how the closing of restaurants and other venues that serve food, such as sporting and entertainment events, was what was putting a strain on the meat market supplies.

With the entire nation confined to their homes and unable to visit restaurants and other venues where food is served, this in turn created a huge demand for more food at grocery stores, while bulk food distributors were left with an excess of inventory that was not packaged properly for retail sales.

Helmer’s article documents how some restaurants have dealt with this situation while solving two problems at once: providing more business for their restaurant so they could stay in business, and providing much needed items to their consumers that they could not find in their local grocery stores, such as eggs, flour, and toilet paper.

Some excerpts from Helmer’s excellent article:

A few short weeks ago, Sarah Heard was cooking dishes like charred duroc pork, veal sweetbreads, and butternut risotto and serving them in the Austin, Texas, restaurant Foreign & Domestic. Now, the dining room is closed, and instead of serving nose-to-tail suppers, chef/owner Heard is filling bags with groceries. In the last two weeks, she has stocked (and sold out of) staples such as eggs, salt, and lemons; customers purchased 100 pounds of flour in a single afternoon. The coronavirus pandemic has led Foreign & Domestic to evolve from a full-service restaurant into a grocery store. “We knew that people were having trouble finding things at the stores,” Heard recalls. “We thought it could help the neighborhood—and it’s possibly the only reason we’re staying afloat.” The pandemic dealt a significant blow to restaurants. The latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that the U.S. lost a total of 701,000 jobs in March; restaurants and bars accounted for 60 percent of those losses. The devastation had forced restaurants to get creative to keep their doors open. In addition to offering takeout and deliveries, steakhouses are being reinvented as butcher shops, upscale eateries are hosting virtual cocktail classes, and chefs are creating DIY meal kits. Turning dining rooms into supermarkets is also proving popular. Read the full article here.

How Do We Change the Nation’s Food Supply Chains?

Food security is a serious issue in this country, and the Coronavirus scare should be a wake-up call for everyone. As far as the food shortages in our grocery stores, this might get worse before it gets better.

And remember, this is all simply the result of people staying home. Imagine how much worse this could be if there were disruptions to our energy sector, and our truckers who transport all this food all across the nation could not get diesel fuel to power their trucks?

Or a disruption to our electrical grid where all of stored refrigerated and frozen foods would quickly spoil? Or even worse scenarios where communication systems went down, such as cell phones and the Internet, and without the ability to communicate to the public things would quickly spin out of control into rioting and looting.

What is the answer to the food security issue?

Those who have followed our reporting on this issue for the past decade or so will know that my position is that government is NOT the solution, but the problem.

Government food policies are what have created the fragile system we have created, with their cheap subsidized commodity food systems along with their fragile supply chains that are so easily disrupted.

No, the answer to food security lies in YOU, the American consumer. Small businesses all across the country, like many of those featured in the articles reported by Civil Eats, are happy to step in and fill in the gaps. They don’t need, and I am sure most do not want, government subsidies to fuel their businesses.

They need you, the American consumer, to start changing their buying habits, and start supporting local businesses.

We need a return to the “old fashion” way of conducting business, where there is a town butcher, a town baker, local grain mills, and local dairy farms and other kinds of farms producing and selling meats, produce, dairy, and other food staples to the consumer directly through local businesses.

Those in the metropolitan areas need to find like-minded neighbors and fellow city residents to band together and form co-ops and buying clubs to support farmers that may be located further out in the rural areas, to more efficiently bring that food from the farm to the tables of those in the cities.

When this country was founded in the 1700s, 90% of the population was involved in agriculture. When the Civil War started under President Lincoln, it was about 50% of the population in agriculture feeding the other 50%.

Today it is less than 1% of the population feeding the other 99%, and just a handful of companies controlling the nation’s food supply.

There is only one way we are going to see more food security in our nation, and it begins with the American consumer, and the consumer’s willingness to sacrifice “convenience” to have one-stop shopping centers that offer everything at cheaper prices (and almost always also cheaper quality food) due to government subsidies.

Will it happen? Will this be enough of a wake-up call to get even 10 percent of the nation’s population to change their buying habits? Because that is probably all it will take to turn the tide and start things rolling in the right direction.

But if everyone sits around and waits for the government to provide solutions, we can see what their history is. They will decide who to bail out and who not to bail out, and they will decide who wins and who loses. And we all know how that turns out.

If government truly wants to help bring food security to our nation’s food supply chains, then the best thing they can do is REMOVE barriers that prevent direct farm-to-consumer sales, such as the Wyoming Food Freedom Act that we highlighted earlier this month, and then get out of the way and let consumers and small businesses flourish in this nation once again.

As long as we still have a vestige of a free society left, the American consumer is still the most powerful force to change our food security problem in the U.S.",fake

Rural hospitals may not be able to keep their doors open as the coronavirus pandemic saps their cash, their CEOs warn, just as communities most need them.

As the coronavirus sweeps across the United States, all hospitals are facing cancellations of doctor visits and procedures by a terrified populace — profitable services that usually help fund hospitals. Meanwhile, the institutions also find themselves needing to pay higher prices for personal protective equipment such as face masks and other gear that's in short supply. Vice President Mike Pence called on hospitals nationwide Wednesday to delay elective surgeries to free up capacity and resources for future coronavirus patients.

The American Hospital Association responded Thursday by asking Congress for $100 billion for all hospitals to offset coronavirus costs, citing rural hospitals' inability to withstand huge losses for long.

""If we're not able to address the short-term cash needs of rural hospitals, we're going to see hundreds of rural hospitals close before this crisis ends,"" warned Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, which represents 21,000 health care providers and hospitals. ""This is not hyperbole.""

Well before the COVID-19 threat, rural health care's profitability had collapsed nationwide due to a combination of narrowing Medicare reimbursements, a larger share of patients lacking high-paying private insurance and the hollowing out of rural America. Given such pressures, more than 120 rural hospitals have been forced to close over the past decade.

Those hospitals in small-town America that have survived rely heavily on moneymakers such as elective surgeries, physical therapy and lab tests to make their razor-thin margins work. But, according to the Chicago-based Chartis Center for Rural Health, almost half of them still operate in the red.

So the added financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak could be the final straw for many rural hospitals — exposing the complicated business dynamics at play within the United States' critical public health infrastructure.

""This virus, and what it is causing for these hospitals, is the perfect storm that will close these hospitals at a time this country critically needs them,"" says Robin Rau, CEO of Miller County Hospital in southwestern Georgia. ""This is going to be the death blow to them.""

Two weeks ago, she started eliminating all medical services that were not urgent. She estimates that has cut off at least half of the hospital's revenue. Other CEOs warned similar cuts at their hospitals mean they won't make payroll in the coming weeks.

The National Rural Health Association, along with many rural hospital executives, is lobbying for immediate cash assistance, no-interest loans, Medicare reimbursement adjustments and other suggestions to alleviate the pain. The association favors a bailout plan from Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., which in early drafts called for the equivalent of a three-month advance based on hospitals' previous patient numbers, according to Bennet's office.

""Rural hospitals have already been closing their doors at startling rates, and this crisis will only exacerbate that fact,"" Bennet tells KHN in a written statement. ""There is an incredible opportunity for rural hospitals to shoulder some of the burdens of caring for patients and helping to meet possible bed shortages.""

Still, many rural hospital CEOs worry any assistance may come too late.

""And yet I hear they're going to bail out the cruise lines? Really?"" Missouri's Scotland County Hospital CEO Dr. Randy Tobler says.

As Tobler looks at his older, sicker, underinsured patient population, he says he is afraid the hospital, located on the state's northeastern rural border, might last only until May before running out of money for payroll.

""In the truly safety-net areas, we're being called to high duty,"" he says. ""And we're running on fumes.""

Michael Purvis, CEO of Candler County Hospital in Metter, Ga., says he's already fallen into a negative cash flow situation in the past week. The number of patients coming to his hospital, which is about 65 miles outside Savannah, for profitable outpatient procedures has dropped by half as people in droves have canceled their surgeries, MRIs and physical therapy. Purvis has implemented fever checks of people at the entrance. But he remains fearful that his billing staff could be forced to quarantine themselves if they fall ill — effectively shutting off the hospital's revenue.

""If my billers and coders stay healthy, I can make it to April, maybe end of June,"" Purvis says.

On top of the massive loss of revenue, Julie Jones, CEO at Community Hospital-Fairfax in northwestern Missouri, says she can only get specialty N95 respirator masks that offer critical protection for her front-line providers for about $5 each — more than 16 times the normal cost of 30 cents.

Angela Ammons, CEO of Clinch Memorial Hospital in Homerville, Ga., says she has warned staff that if hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes continue to go missing, she'll watch the video footage and fire on the spot anyone caught stealing supplies. And she is so worried about running out of protective equipment, she's asking any of her ""crafty"" staff with sewing machines to sew cotton masks.

""I would rather staff go in with a fabric mask than no mask at all,"" she says.

To be sure, rural hospitals are not as equipped as larger hospital systems to handle the most serious coronavirus cases. Many are not outfitted with ICUs or enough doctors and staff to handle multiple intensive care patients. That means they have to transfer those patients to larger hospitals.

Still, rural experts argue that their bed and health care capacity can be leveraged to keep potential coronavirus cases out of the major hospitals. Plus, rural facilities could be places for initial triage or eventual recovery care.

And if nothing changes, Rau worries, the country is about to lose this critical public health infrastructure.

""We can talk all we want about the cost of health care in this country in this ridiculous health care system we have,"" she says. ""But at a time like this, who for a minute would think about getting rid of rural hospitals?""

In response, Moog and Korg have both made certain synth apps free for a limited time.

Moog’s Minimoog Model D iOS app is now free, and it cost $4.99 when it was introduced in 2018. It’s a faithful visual reproduction of the hardware version (which will set you back a few thousand bucks). Since it’s digital, Moog took a few liberties and added capabilities not available in its physical counterpart. For example, the hardware Minimoog Model D can only produce one note at a time, but up to four notes can be played at once on the app.

Korg is also making its Kaossilator app for iOS and Android free for a limited time. Kaossilator is mainly for making tracks based on layering loops and has a ton of tools for playing around with 150 built-in sounds. Also, there are ways to lock scale and key so you can noodle around without any musical knowledge and make something that sounds decent. This app normally costs $19.99 and is free until March 31st.

Moog said the move was done to “spread positivity, creativity, and expressivity,” while Korg says the offering is a way to “help you with a musical way to occupy your mind.”

If you want to get even more down the rabbit hole, there are a few other free synth apps for iOS, like AudioKit’s Synth One and Tenacious Frog’s TF7 Synth (which is free, but offers in-app purchases). And of course, there are a variety of other free music-making and modulating apps like GarageBand, Korg Gadget 2 Le, Launchpad, and pitch-processing app Voloco, which I fell in love with after an auto-tuned cat went viral on Twitter. I highly recommend it.

States clamoring for coronavirus tests in recent weeks have been talking about two types.

First, there's a PCR test that detects the virus's genetic material and so can confirm an active infection. And then there's an antibody test, which looks at the body's reaction to that infection and so is useful in identifying people who have been infected with the virus in the past.

Now, there's a third kind of test under development to help fight COVID-19 that homes in on proteins that stud the virus's outer surface; it, too, detects an active infection. Known as an antigen test, this one could offer a much easier and more widely available alternative for diagnosis than the PCR test, proponents say, though some other scientists remain concerned about the test's reliability.

""We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing,"" Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force said recently on Meet the Press in her most recent pitch for antigen tests. ""We have to be able to detect antigen rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself.""

Though there are no authorized coronavirus antigen tests on the market yet, several companies are already working on them, including one that has started seeking a stamp of approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

""It's very exciting,"" says Lee Gehrke, a microbiologist at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is involved with E25BIO, a Cambridge, Mass., company developing the test. ""It could change the landscape for testing.""

OraSure Technologies Inc. of Bethlehem, Pa., is also developing an antigen test that would enable people to test themselves at home from a saliva sample.

""Having a rapid antigen — in-home — self-test will help both combat the virus and also individual fear,"" says Stephen Tang, the company's chief executive officer. ""It actually gives the individual a bit of control and understanding — whether they're infectious and whether family members are infectious. So I think it starts to get us back in a mindset where we can control our destiny.""

Public health experts agree that such a test could be very helpful.

""Rapid antigen tests would be valuable because of their speed,"" Tom Inglesby, who directs the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, wrote in an email.

But Inglesby and others caution that any antigen tests would have to be carefully vetted to make sure they're accurate. Relaxed oversight by the FDA recently has raised concerns about the reliability of some other kinds of tests — such as antibody tests — which are being marketed aggressively by some companies with unverified claims.

When used to look for other types of infections, such as testing for the flu, or for strep in someone with a sore throat, antigen tests have tended to miss more infected people than the PCR tests for the coronavirus typically do, experts say.

""We know an awful lot about the performance of antigen detection tests,"" says Frederick Nolte, who heads testing at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""And we know that that sensitivity leaves a lot to be desired.""

Generally, antigen tests tend to miss about 15 to 20% of infections, Nolte and others say, and that's likely not good enough for many uses of a diagnostic test for the coronavirus.

""If you're using this test to screen people to make sure that they're not infected, and that they go back to work or things like that, then you'd be giving people the message that they are not infected when actually they are — and therefore transmitting the new coronavirus,"" says Jesse Papenburg, an infectious disease expert at McGill University.

The tests currently used to see whether people are actively infected with the virus are sophisticated molecular tests that can spot its genetic material in specimens swabbed from inside people's noses and throats. Most use the technique known as polymerase chain reaction — PCR — to generate and analyze millions of copies of genetic sequences from the virus.

But those tests require sophisticated equipment, highly trained technicians and complicated processes that use specialized chemicals; those strict requirements of PCR tests, and problems in reliably meeting them, have contributed to the testing shortage.

Wide-scale testing is considered crucial for determining the scope of the pandemic, bringing it under control and keeping large new outbreaks from occurring. Testing enables public health authorities to spot new infections quickly so patients can be isolated and so anyone they might have had contact with.

Typically, antigen tests are much easier and less expensive to manufacture and simpler to perform than either PCR tests or antibody tests. The same technology is used in pregnancy tests.

""It looks very much like a pregnancy test. And they're very simple. They don't require special chemicals or training to use them. And they can give you a read out in about 15 minutes or so,"" says Gehrke, one of the collaborators on the E25BIO test.

Gehrke says his company's test appears to be very accurate when evaluated with samples of the virus in the lab.

""The difficult question — and the one we want to ask — is how well does it perform on samples from real patients,"" Gehrke says.

Papenburg questions whether antigen test could ever be as reliable as the genetic tests because, unlike those PCR tests, they can't produce large quantities of the target proteins — so might be more likely to miss an infection.

Tang says OraSure is also conducting careful studies to ensure the company's test would be reliable — able to not only detect an infection with the novel coronavirus, but also to quickly and accurately discern it from other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold.

""Our aiming point for our rapid antigen test is to make it highly sensitive and highly specific,"" Tang says, though he acknowledges that it remains to be seen how the test will compare to the molecular tests. It could turn out the antigen test's results would have to be confirmed by the PCR tests, Tang says.

Another company, Mologic in the United Kingdom, is developing an antigen test and hopes to get it approved by June, according to Fionna Tod, a company spokeswoman. The test would produce results in 10 minutes and would sell for about $1, she says, which could be very helpful in less affluent parts of the world.

In an email, the company's medical director, Joe Fitchett, noted that genetic tests often use samples gathered through an uncomfortable procedure that involves swabbing deep into the nose.

""PCR tests using nasal swabs can be deeply uncomfortable, and poor technique is well-documented to lead to false negatives,"" Fitchett says. ""On the other hand, saliva that can be deployed in a rapid antigen test and could offer better, more user-friendly performance — that will be critical for a self-test.""

During a briefing Wednesday announcing a $1.5 billion effort to speed the development of new coronavirus tests, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said it could be possible to develop reliable antigen tests.

""While traditionally, antigen-based tests have lower sensitivity and specificity than do nucleic acid tests, I don't believe there's any law of physics that says that has to be the case,"" Collins said.",real

The poster child for these selfish ‘covidiots’ – who will statistically survive coronavirus – was a spring breaker from Ohio, Bradley Sluder – told CBS News: “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying,” adding “We’re just out here having a good time. Whatever happens, happens.”

“If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I'm not gonna let it stop me from partying”: Spring breakers are still flocking to Miami, despite coronavirus warnings. https://t.co/KoYKI8zNDH pic.twitter.com/rfPfea1LrC — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 18, 2020

In case you were wondering how far these spring break ‘covidiots’ traveled for their ill-advised debauchery data visualization company Tectonix used cell phone location data collected by company X-Mode to map out the travels of thousands of spring breakers, using special geo-spatial big-data analysis software.

The data – provided by cell phone companies in near real-time, was anonymized.

Watch:

This shows the location data of phones that were on a Florida beach during Spring Break. It then shows where those phones traveled.

1762,1138,http://sputniknews.com/columnists/202005161079322029-now-boris-beat-obesity/,2020-05-16,Now Boris Beat Obesity!,"Boris has declared the next front in his ‘war’ against Covid-19 is obesity and I’m backing him 100 percent.

The Prime Minister’s dice with death and time spent in intensive care has evidently changed his mind-set when it comes to intervening in public health. Like me, years ago, he saw initiatives like the sugar tax as part of the Nanny state and he was dead against it.

However, according to James Forsyth writing in the Times today Johnson’s had a major change of heart and it has been driven by the now undeniable link between coronavirus and obesity. He is convinced that the reason he ended up in intensive care was because of his weight.

This change of heart echoes what top cardiologist, Dr Aseem Malhotra has been campaigning about for years and it is urgent that the views of Aseem are now taken very seriously at the top of Government as there is no time to waste.

Pioneers like Aseem and Dr David Unwin have now proved that Type 2 diabetes is not an irreversible, lifelong chronic disease and that it can be tackled with lifestyle and diet changes, not more and more drugs.

Boris has come to the same conclusion as Aseem Malhotra that one of the main reasons why the UK has been so hard hit by Coronavirus is just how obese the UK population is. There is no denying that Obesity is the second biggest coronavirus risk factor, after age, and more than a quarter of Brits are obese.

Listen to the Experts

Aseem Malhotra’s was my guest on my sputnik radio show last week, listen here.

He explained that there's a very strong link between conditions like type two diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and increasing death rates from COVID-19.

Aseem believes that our nations’ diet with its reliance on fast food and ultra-processed food is one of the major factors behind our obesity crisis and is strongly linked to a whole host of other diseases. He favours a move to a more Mediterranean style of diet and is a supporter of eating a low carbohydrate high fat diet.

He believes this style of eating can fundamentally change our health and is a believer that Type 2 diabetes can be reversed in this manner.

He told me in last week’s show that “current NHS guidelines haven't caught up with the science. What I would say though, interestingly, is new evidence suggests for Type 2 diabetes, specifically, that a low carbohydrate diet is a safe and effective option, but the problem is, it's not well publicized.""

Dr Malhotra stunned me when he also stated that the public aren't aware that the present dietary guidance is not independently formulated and companies like Coca Cola, Kellogg's, Pepsi, McDonald's, amongst many others directly influence the guidance. He says ""they are not there to look after your health, they're certainly not there to protect you from getting Type 2 diabetes or obesity, in fact, the opposite in a way because they want to make money by selling you more food. The question is, why are they involved in making up what's supposed to be independent guidance? And that for me that is the real scandal.""

Big Sugar Fake

This is a point that has been taken up today on Twitter by former Tory Minister, David Davies who tweeted, ‘Good to see Boris taking obesity seriously now. But he had better be sure the science behind any policy is right. Quite a lot of evidence that all Western governments have based guidance on bad science for 50 years. We must review the science first, then act.’

He is correct that thee science is not only outdated but it was fake from day one and funded by the sugar industry.

Effectively in the 1960’s the sugar industry paid scientists to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and instead to promote the idea that saturated fat was the driver of heart disease.

This fake news or “science” then shaped five decades of nutritional advice and dietary recommendations. In other words, Big Sugar controlled the agenda and many say they still do!

Look at the Evidence

It was also good to see Labour’s ex Deputy Leader, Tom Watson give his support too by tweeting, ‘David is right on this, we need independently funded nutritional science. There’s so much more we can do to unify the nation on this agenda.’

The thing that unites these two political heavyweights is the fact that both lost tons of weight (8 stone in Watson’s case) by following a low carbohydrate high fat diet combined with gentle exercise.

According to the Times' article today Boris favours getting everyone on a bike to promote fitness and weight loss but he should heed the wise words of Professor Tim Noakes of the University of Johannesburg who states unequivocally that you cannot out run (or out cycle) a bad diet. Its’ what we eat that is the primary driver of obesity.

If Boris is still not convinced he should have a word with his health secretary, Matt Hancock, who declared at the World Economic Forum in China on September 19 2018 that he had lost 2 stone in 3 months by cutting out carbs from his diet.

He said, ""It is clear that obesity is one of the rising challenges for the health of the nation, the links between obesity, diabetes and to cancer are increasingly clear.”

“We need to ensure that people don’t always reach to the medicinal solution. Losing weight, activity and eating better are there of the best things that you can do to tackle obesity.” He also praised Tom Watson calling him “an example to many.”

If Boris wants more evidence he could always give me a call, as I too have reversed my Type 2 diabetes, got my blood pressure into the normal range and solved a myriad of other health issues by adopting a low carb high fat lifestyle combined with gentle walking.

I was a type 2 diabetic for 15 years, weighing in at the best part of 22 stone and on at least ten tablets a day.

Stop Dietary Genocide

I’m not alone as people all around the globe are doing it for themselves but still the dietary guidelines push the concept of the Eatwell plate and tell us to eat starchy carbs. It is sugar and starchy carbs (which turn to glucose) that is the enemy, not fat.

Obesity is not just costing lives it is also costing the NHS billions and many experts believe if Type 2 cases continue to rise it could effectively bankrupt the NHS.

At the moment the Annual spend on the treatment of obesity and diabetes is greater than the amount spent on the police, the fire service and the judicial system combined.

Type 2 diabetes and obesity is killing more people than Covid19 and Professor Tim Noakes has even gone so far as to describe the present dietary guidelines as a “genocide.”

Covid-19 caught us unaware and unprepared but there is no need for Type 2 diabetes and Obesity to do the same. We know the problem and we know the fix. Boris let’s get it done now. Let’s change the dietary guidelines now.

Opinion contributor

My son defended his doctoral dissertation virtually this spring, from an apartment where he lives alone, 3,123 miles away from me. In normal times, one of his mentors would have brought a bottle of good champagne to toast the newly-minted Professor Clayton. In normal times, I’d have a ticket for a seat beside his 87-year-old grandfather on a six-hour flight to applaud the short moment of Chris walking across a stage in crimson silk gown and black-and-crimson hood, with the white crow's-feet emblem of an arts and sciences guy, an economist.

Instead, we’re looking for an alternative way to honor six years of incredibly hard work. I’m caught without the eggs and chocolate even to make his favorite flourless chocolate cake. I’m seeking advice by tweet about what that shop where he buys Thanksgiving pies might be, and whether they could deliver to his door in time for the box to be quarantined, or whether disinfecting it with bleach spray is good enough.

We've lost our traditions

Ceremony. Merriam Webster defines it as “a formal act or series of acts prescribed by ritual, protocol, or convention.” But what do you do when a pandemic makes ritual, protocol, and convention impossible? “Celebrate” is “to perform (a sacrament or solemn ceremony) publicly and with appropriate rites.” Publicly.

It feels indulgent, to grieve such a small loss. My family remains alive and uninfected. We are not saying that last goodbye by phone to a loved one dying in a hospital room without our hand to hold. We are not postponing that ultimate of ceremonies, the funeral. We are not having to bear that ultimate of griefs alone.

The loss of ceremony is not even the hardest thing my son has had to endure in his relatively short life. Not even close. And he starts his dream job at a university July 1. He won’t even suffer a health insurance gap.

And yet I cry in the shower, as do, I suppose, millions of us all over the world. We grieve the chance to celebrate those we love in what used to be the big moments in life, in the time before every moment of life itself seemed so very big. Moments that, all over the world, and for all of human history, have been marked by ceremony.

Pandemic life:We're slouching toward graduation at home with our college senior

No flipping of tassels or tossing of graduation caps this May and June. Not for college students or law students or Ph.D.s. Not for high schools. Not for middle schools or preschools. Not for medical students, many of whom are already out working in the fight to defeat this virus. Even the U.S. Naval Academy, where the hat-tossing tradition began in 1912, tossed theirs this year without the benefit of an audience to applaud.

No dancing at weddings or comic stuffing of cake bites into newlywed mouths. No babies crying over baptismal fonts. No awkward student welcomes and get-to-know-yous over the summer. Birthdays. Anniversaries. Publication parties. Film premieres. Retirements. Not even a Mother’s Day brunch for most of us.

Easter teleconference to meet a baby

This spring, there will be none of those moments we photograph and paste into scrap books, share with our virtual friends, and set out in frames for years to come.

So we adapt, of course. My niece introduces her new daughter into the family by Easter teleconference. My nephew considers delaying a fall wedding until we can all gather again. Zoom becomes a verb with a new meaning, and we have never been so grateful to be living in the time of video technology that was the stuff of television-show fiction when many of us were growing up.

HOTLINE:Share your coronavirus story

My son, like so many graduates this year, will attend a virtual commencement and a “special online event” for some smaller group of Ph.D. candidates or economists, the details of which are being worked out now.

He will also be feted in person “sometime later, once we know it is safe to bring people together again,” his university president assures us. That celebration will come with “all of the pomp, circumstance, and tradition that is typical” of their commencements, and “as many of the traditional campus festivities that typically precede commencement as possible.”

We need a Coronavirus Service Corps:It will help America and our vulnerable young people

We will be there whenever we can be, and we will applaud all the more enthusiastically for having endured this moment and come out on the other side. We hope we will, anyway. We are staying indoors, and living without eggs if they can’t be delivered to us, and recognizing the privilege we have to be able to stay inside, stay well, and endure only these small griefs.

And, yes, we cry in the shower. But we also appreciate these pivotal life moments even more somehow, for having to experience them virtually, or to look forward to the time when “celebrate” is once again a present-tense verb.

1773,485,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/4/29/21241424/college-sports-football-economics-notre-dame-universitiy-coronavirus-covid,2020-04-29,Top football recruits bring in big money for colleges — and COVID-19 threatens it all,"Colleges and universities are spending more than ever to land the nation’s top football recruits, with some schools having boosted their recruiting budgets by more than 300% in the last five years.

These budgets can surpass $2 million for schools like the University of Tennessee.

Is it worth it?

I study economics. Research I recently did shows just how big the payoff for spending money to recruit the best players can be.

Opinion

Half a million dollars

The schools that secure five-star recruits — the 30 or so players judged to be in the top one-hundreth of the top 1% of high school football players — can increase total revenue by over $500,000 for a university’s athletic department. Most football teams never secure a five-star recruit. Others, such as the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University, recruit three or four every year.

My research team came to this $500,000 figure by linking 10 years’ worth of football recruiting information from Rivals.com and Scout.com, two of the top recruiting services for prospective college football players, with federal data on how much colleges take in and spend on athletics, win-loss records for individual schools and post-season bowl appearances.

The data shows revenue and expenditures for each sport separately, which made it possible to determine what a football recruit added to football revenue at each university.

Schools like the University of Oklahoma, the University of Michigan and Notre Dame, which on average bring in over a dozen four- or five-star recruits every year, bring in millions of dollars more in revenue when they land more of the top recruits in a given year.

For instance, my estimates suggests that Clemson University’s five-star recruits, of which there were five, and 12 four-star recruits — also in top one-quarter of 1% of all players — in the 2020 recruiting class will increase the school’s football revenue by well over $3 million, well above its $1.8 million recruiting budget.

The reason is simple: Top recruits help teams win.

Since a top recruit correlates strongly with increases in the number of victories, they help determine the type of post-season play. Five-star recruits are not the deciding factor in whether a school gets to a bowl game, the mark of a winning season — the big-time programs will have winning records every year without fail.

But they do push them to the upper echelon of post-season play — the College Football Playoffs or its forerunner, the Bowl Championship Series. Reaching the championship level in college football contributes to lucrative broadcast contracts, corporate partnerships and even more successful recruiting.

Very few schools are consistently successful in the race to recruit top football talent and win at the highest levels. Just as nine schools have been responsible for 20% of all players drafted into the NFL over the past two decades, only six schools have made it to the College Football Playoff championship game.

Financing other sports

There is more than hoisting football trophies at stake.

College football is a key driver of athletic department revenue as well, helping to pay for other sports programs. Athletic departments that field more than 30 varsity teams do so understanding that fewer than five varsity teams generate enough revenue to cover the entire athletics department’s expenses.

In fact, some critics argue that big-time college sports, which feature rosters made up primarily of black student-athletes, pay for the sports programs that include overwhelmingly white student-athletes, such as lacrosse and swimming, which receive far less media attention but are the bulk of athletes in major collegiate sports programs. Sixty-one percent of all student athletes are white.

Football revenue also helps finance athletic recruiting efforts and amenities, such as state-of-the-art facilities. All of that takes money, which takes recruits, which takes money. Every recruiting video, campus visit and hosted meal is a line item on an athletic department’s budget.

COVID-19 repercussions

The possibility of there being no college football season in the fall of 2020 is making athletics departments fear big budget cuts.

Already, some schools are dropping sports that were subsidized by college football revenues, like men’s soccer and wrestling. Smaller schools that depend on a few $1 million paydays in September from the major programs, may be left with gaping holes in their athletic budgets, threatening all sports.

There is little doubt that changes are coming to the current model of athletic department operations through a variety of converging forces. COVID-19 is unleashing widespread job losses, business closures and declining consumer spending that will limit what fans and advertisers can spend on football.

Another factor could be a change by the National Collegiate Athletic Association — which governs college athletics — that could allow student-athletes to get paid from their name, image and likeness.

While schools rich with talent may continue to get richer, those schools further down the recruiting pecking order will be left to wonder how they can survive at all.

1774,1935,https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-05-23-plandemic-google-drive-delete.html,2020-05-23,"If you have a copy of Plandemic in your Google Drive, Google might try to surreptitiously delete it","(Natural News) Fake news empire The Washington Post is on a mission to make sure that every single copy of the popular Plandemic documentary film is removed from every last crevice of the internet.

The Jeff Bezos-owned, left-wing rag recently published an article in its “technology” section explaining that fake news employees of the paper are basically being paid to scour the web in search of Plandemic so they can report it to the hosting website and try to have it removed.

One perhaps unexpected place that the Post has had no trouble getting Plandemic removed from is Google Drive, a cloud-based file-sharing service that many Facebook users and YouTubers have been linking to whenever public copies of the film get censored or removed by Big Tech platforms.

Even though Google Drive accounts are supposed to be private, much like your personal hard drive, the Post has reportedly been successful in convincing Google to invade users’ files and remove Plandemic whenever they find a copy.

To those who know the Constitution, this is an obvious violation of free speech and personal privacy. But to the Post, it is a necessary response to the “weaponization” of Google Drive’s services for the purpose of “amplify[ing] dangerous content.”

Because Plandemic offers a different take on the pandemic that does not fully align with the official narrative, the Post and its Big Tech partners do not believe that you should be allowed to view it.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how even Brighteon is now being censored by Facebook, probably because it hosts the Plandemic film without question or restriction:

The Post is now actively policing channels, pages that try to share the Plandemic film

One would think that, logically speaking, there is nothing to fear from allowing Plandemic to circulate far and wide if the content it contains is “false” and “dangerous” as the Post claims. It will eventually debunk itself, right?

Since the fix is on to force it down the memory hole, however, we can only conclude that there must be something to Plandemic that those fomenting the sham crusade against it do not want the public to learn.

Facebook and YouTube both announced back in early May that Plandemic had to go from their platforms because it makes “medically unsubstantiated” claims about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Among other things, the film questions the alleged importance of lockdowns. It also features the astute Dr. Judy Mikovitz who wrote a powerful book entitled,Â Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science that questions vaccine safety and effectiveness, a big no-no.

What many social media users are having to do in order to still draw attention to Plandemic online is manually edit out Dr. Mikovitz’s interviews, for instance, or remove the “most problematic claims,” to quote the Post. In other words, only censored versions of the Plandemic trailer are being allowed to circulate.

Elon Musk of Tesla conducted his own witch hunt back in March against the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is similarly being targeted by Big Tech. Musk tweeted a link to a Google Drive document citing a study about the alleged efficacy of the drug, and since that time Google has removed and blocked that document.

When asked if Google actively scans the files that users store in Google Drive, Google spokeswoman Alex Krasov refused to say, adding that her company “doesn’t go into details” about how its anti-misinformation policies are enforced.

Whether it’s helping people find reliable information in search, working with the government on testing, building an exposure-tracking system into Android and iOS in partnership with Apple, or battling misinformation on YouTube, Google’s capability — and responsibility — has never been greater.

Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai recently joined The Vergecast to talk about the challenges Google faces during this time, including a shift in its core ad business and the challenges of managing the company remotely. Pichai is himself adapting to remote work; he’s actively blocking out more time on his calendar to read and think, something he used to do during his commute. And he’s learning to make pizza from scratch by watching YouTube videos.

“It came out okay,” he said.

Pichai also talked about Google’s commitment to its hardware business, including the Pixel phone line, and how the company is continuing to try to simplify its famously complex messaging app strategy.

“The irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see,” said Pichai.

You can listen to the full interview below, in the podcast player of your choice, or scroll down to read a full transcript, lightly edited for clarity.

Nilay Patel: There’s three things I really want to talk about. One, how Google is handling the pandemic. Two, how your business is being impacted. And three, I talk to every CEO about how they manage their time, and I’m confident that managing a company the size of Google remotely has changed that.

I want to talk about all that stuff. But there were two big stories about Google that are important [from last week]. I want to ask two questions about them right away. First, there’s a big NBC piece from April Glaser suggesting that your diversity efforts have been wound down [and] that the company is not even using the word “diversity” internally anymore. Is that true?

Sundar Pichai: Diversity is a foundational value for us. Given the scale at which we build products and the fact we do it locally for our users, we are deeply committed to having that representation in our workforce. I think we were one of the earliest companies to publish transparency reports, and we’ve shared that ever since. And we just released our recent annual diversity report. We’ve made modest progress in critical areas. There’s a long ways to go. But it is really important.

What we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale. We look at that first — see what works, what we can scale up better. All I can say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any point in our history as a company, in terms of the scale and the resources we put in.

NP: There’s part of that report, which is interesting to talk about, because we hear about it in regards to Facebook a lot, but I don’t know if we’ve ever really asked anybody at Google about it. It’s that criticism from the conservative side of the aisle is something you’re more responsive to with these initiatives, with how you’re running the company. Is that something you think about, in terms of who’s criticizing you from where?

Our diversity efforts, we don’t bring any such lens to it. There are many areas where we are still, as an industry, as a company, dramatically underrepresented. So there’s a long way for us to go. And we’ve just not had that consideration. I think, independently, just within the company, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints, and no one feels they’re not part of the company, regardless of their political viewpoints, amongst other things. But that’s about it. I think these are two independent things.

Dieter Bohn: So the other big story that hit yesterday, from the day we’re recording, was over at The Information, about Mario Queiroz and Marc Levoy quietly leaving the Pixel division, and the Pixel sales numbers maybe not being super great. Is the Pixel business living up to where you hoped it would be right now?

I’ll comment on hardware, and then talk about Pixel, too.

The last couple of years have been a major integration phase for us because we’ve combined our Google hardware efforts with Nest. We absorbed the mobile division of HTC. So it’s been a lot of stitching together. And we have a wide product portfolio, too. So it’s definitely been a building phase. We’re super committed to it for the long run. Hardware is hard. And it definitely has components, which take real time to get it right, thinking about underlying silicon or display or camera or any of those tacks. And so we are definitely investing in it, but that timeline. I think we’ve made a lot of progress.

“Hardware is hard.”

Pixel 3A last year was one of our highest NPS-rated products ever, and definitely even benchmarked outside. So to me, it’s a clear indication we have made a lot of progress. We just launched Pixel Buds this week, which you guys covered — thank you — to a good reception. Our Nest Home Hub products are definitely doing well.

We take a long-term view. We are not in it just for phones alone. We have a vision of where computing needs to go. And I think it’s really hard to drive that vision without doing hardware, software, and services together. You have to think of the intersection of it. I see a lot of value in thinking about it and doing it that way.

We are definitely going to have hiccups. We are a nascent player in a really complex space, so not everything’s going to be smooth. But am I excited about our portfolio for later this year — especially if I take a longer-term view? Because some of the deeper efforts we are putting in will take three to four years to actually play out. And when they come in, I think I’m excited about how they will shape where we are going.

DB: Yeah. I’ve asked you “How serious are you about hardware?” every year since you created the division, and sort of like with self-driving cars it’s, “Well, it’ll be a five-year timeframe, it’ll be a five-year timeframe.” That five-year timeframe always seems to be five years out.

So when you say you’re in it for the long term, is that still the timeframe that you’re thinking of for [hardware] really bringing back really serious results in terms of big sales numbers or big influence in the market or are you looking for something more immediate?

No, I mean we think about our hardware efforts obviously in the context of our overall computing efforts and in addition to what our ecosystem is doing. So we take that into account. I do think it’s important we build a sustainable business, financially, too. Because I look at the level of investment hardware needs, both in terms of all the technology R&D you need to do, the kind of supply chain you need to develop, as well as the go-to-market investments you need. So it’s a deep investment. So to do it well, I think you have to do it with a clear financial sustainability goal. So that’s important.

So for me, three reasons. One is to drive computing forward. The second is we really guide our ecosystem. Pretty much everything we’ve done well, you can go all the way back and Android’s early days, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which we worked together, was a pivotal phone. Nexus 7 in the tablet world. I can point to Chromebooks — all along, we did our original hardware to kind of bootstrap it. And I look at areas maybe where we haven’t done opinionated [work] — maybe [smart]watch is a good example where we haven’t. And then you can see it’s tough to guide an ecosystem to what your vision of it is, just building the underlying platform.

So I think that’s the second reason. And third is to really build a sustainable hardware business. I think all of it is important, and that’s how I think about it. And I’m excited. Rick [Osterloh] and team, working closely with Hiroshi [Lockheimer] and team, they have that long-term view. So we’re pretty committed to it.

Listen to The Vergecast, the only podcast you need to make sense of this week’s tech news, hosted by Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. Subscribe here!

DB: So you’re the CEO of Alphabet now, in addition to Google. How much of your time do you actually even get to devote to hardware? Are you looking at prototypes? Is it just sort of one meeting in a week? Or is it a larger part of your time?

It’s just a coincidence, I think, I spent my morning with the team today talking about our portfolio for next year.

DB: Anything you want to tell us?

You guys are going to figure it out anyway!

It’s a good question. Rick and Hiroshi drive these efforts. But I try to spend time in a more stepped-back way on some of the bigger things they are doing over time.

NP: Dieter is pointing out — he just reviewed the Galaxy... A51?

DB: That’s right.

NP: That’s a cheap phone. He gave it a seven. The reason we reviewed it—

I saw the intro to the video where you said, “This phone sells more than the Galaxy.” I actually watched the video.

DB: It actually was the top-selling phone last quarter worldwide.

I think I learned it from watching your video. It was just kind of interesting. Maybe I should have known that.

NP: That’s the question here. When we think about your phones coming out, we think about are you competitive with the flagship Samsung devices? We think, are you competitive with the iPhones? But the bulk of the market is down there, at $399, $499. Is that where you want to be? Or do you want to go make a big flagship phone and take share away from the top of the market?

The area where we have demonstrated the strongest value proposition, that’s why I gave the [Pixel] 3A example, it’s where we clearly have demonstrated it. But having said that, if you want to drive computing forward, that high end is where you’re going to also keep moving the needle. And it’s where we are putting a lot of our effort into.

So you will continue to see us invest in both ends of the spectrum. We care all the way — [we’re] obviously working with our ecosystem [on] entry-level devices. I’m deeply passionate about that. But definitely, the high end is something where we’re putting in a lot of effort. That’s where some of the underlying investments pay. It accumulates over time because it takes two to three years to do some of the deeper investments you need to do it really well.

DB: Are you seeing — especially now with everyone at home — are you seeing big changes in consumer behavior in terms of buying hardware? Is everyone going out and buying Nest cameras? Or they feel that they don’t need them because they’re at home anyway? Anything changing for you there?

Obviously, on the software side, we have clearly seen impact in terms of usage across several of our products. Some products have been negatively affected, too. But we can clearly measure it. Hardware is a bit more complex because it’s really gated by the supply chain, [which] got affected for different products in different ways, and demand has definitely been affected, too. Some of it is to do with lack of retail working well and all that stuff. So I think it is tough to exactly forecast what demand will come back. So for me, it’s too early to tell.

NP: Let’s skip into the broader business of Google and how it’s going. Dieter had the question about consumer behavior. I just had this guess, so I’m going to ask you: is Maps usage way down?

Yeah, totally. [Laughs] You alone not using it is probably contributing. No, I’m just kidding.

NP: I’m always using it.

No, it did have a significant — obviously, as people aren’t driving around, you clearly saw an impact. Interesting to me, was maybe over the last two to three weeks, we definitely see users coming back to it looking for local information. So definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what’s around, what’s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again. So there’s this clear inflection, but not clear what that fully means. But that’s where it is.

NP: And then in your broader business — obviously Google makes the bulk of its revenue in advertising. We have felt the effects of the advertising market changing. The whole world has felt the effects of the advertising market changing. How are you seeing those effects at Google? What are you doing to manage against them?

I spoke about it in the earnings call. Compared to January and February, we clearly saw the impact in March. So for sure, Google is not immune to the global economy. In some ways, it’s representative across all sectors. So clearly, as entire sectors have been affected — travel being a particularly severe example of it — we have definitely felt that across the board.

“Google is not immune to the global economy.”

What’s interesting for us is, historically, compared to past cycles, search is something that is very highly ROI-driven, performance-oriented. And so advertisers adapt. They pull back quickly. We see demand shifts and people capitalizing on it. You will see activity in “office furniture” instantly, right then. So you can kind of see the economy adapt in real time. And so it’s fascinating to see it that way. But for sure, it’s definitely impacted our business.

DB: In your earnings call, you hinted that this wasn’t going to turn around right away next quarter. We’re in for a tough time for a while. But coming out of this in however long it takes, do you think that the ad market is going to look substantially similar to what it looked like a year ago? Or are you thinking that things are going to fundamentally change in your ad business, or in your business generally, in a way that you’re able to look at now? Or is it just way too early to tell? It’s too hard to forecast?

It’s the question, which is on a lot of our minds: What are the trends you are seeing which have reverted back to the mean? And what is it that is here to stay? Well, will travel ever return to what it was before? And so on.

It’s obviously tough to predict with the nature of the virus, how long it’ll be. We generally assume the effects will be there for a while. I think that’s the right way to think about it. As a company, we assume that it’s going to take a while to recover, and [we’re] planning for it that way. But it’s a bit hard for me to say.

Human needs are pretty fundamental, I think, in terms of being social, wanting to meet people. Personally, I can’t wait to be back in a... I wish I could go watch a football game or something.

Would I like to go to a music concert? The answer is yes. So I think the innate human need is there. But I think it’ll be a while before we get back to it. So I expect it to be kind of a slow, steady recovery.

NP: How are you thinking about the general push to reopen? At Google, you said people are going to work from home through 2020. What are you thinking about for Google? And then broadly, how are you thinking about this push to reopen, particularly in the United States?

Early on, I felt we were one of the first to go to work from home, partly because I think it made sense for the health and safety of our employees. I felt that, given a lot of our work could be done from home, it made sense for us to contribute to social distancing. Clearly, the needs vary widely across different groups. We talked about hardware earlier — definitely having access to testing equipment, labs, it’s really important. You can’t test whether something works in 5G unless you can actually be in that testing environment.

So it varies widely across teams. And we are going to be conservative on the return back for the broad company. When the local ordinance allows, I think we’ll probably start with trying to get 10 to 15 percent of the company back, prioritizing people who actually kind of need to be there. And that way, we can really have a de-densified environment and have a lot of safety procedures in place. And just because we are talking about 10 to 15 percent capacity doesn’t mean that many people — we can rotate and actually get more people in once or twice a week.

“A vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year.”

And you have people in two different buckets. There are people who really want to come back, and they miss it. Especially at Google, for 20 years, we have genuinely invested in our physical spaces and the culture it creates with a view to having people work well together. And so I think there are people who miss that part of the experience, depending on what your personal situation is. And then there are people on the other side of the spectrum who want to be conservative. So we are trying to make that play out.

But I expect by the end of the year, we’ll be at 20 to 30 percent capacity. Which may still mean we are able to get 60 percent of our employees in once a week, or something like that. And so that’s what we mean, where a vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year. But it’s a very fluid situation. If things, of course, look better, we will adapt to it. We want to be flexible. Trying to really understand what works, what doesn’t work in this.

DB: Are you thinking longer term in terms of the number of people that might work from home or work remotely? Twitter just announced forever. You can work from home for as long as you want. Are you thinking in that way, too? Or are you going to wait and see how things play out?

I want to be driven by data here, and so I view it as a research phase, and [we’ll] see where the data leads us. In some ways, I’m glad Twitter is running a kind of one-end-of-the-spectrum experiment. So thanks, Jack. It’s good to see that end of the spectrum.

Productivity is down in certain parts, and what is not clear to me is — in the first two months, most of the people are already on projects in which they kind of know what they need to do. But the next phase, which will kick in is, let’s say you’re designing next year’s products, and you’re in a brainstorming phase, and things are more unstructured. How does that collaboration actually work? That’s a bit hard to understand and do. So we are trying to understand what works well and what doesn’t.

We’re probably going to be conservative in it. We want to make sure things work well. But coming out of it all, do we all learn and have more flexibility in how we think about this? I think so, yeah. That’s how I would bet.

NP: I’m going to take this moment to somehow transition and ask you about messaging strategy. I’m going to figure it out. You just come with me as we do it.

[Laughs] How can I do a Verge podcast without thinking about our—

DB: Pop quiz, hotshot. Name all the products.

Our entire complexity in messaging is to make sure Verge has plenty of material to work with.

NP: Google has historically been good at dogfooding and using its own products. Obviously, this is a moment to use these products in a way that maybe had never been stressed before. You added gallery view to Meet. That seems like a button that should have been there, and suddenly everybody realized it’s not there, and snap, it’s there.

But there are some bigger competitors. There’s more consumer-focused companies that are succeeding, like Zoom. Is this a moment of clarity for you? To say, “We actually have to win this. We know what we need to do because we’re using our own products as much as we are.”

It’s definitely an important moment. We brought Javier [Soltero] in a few months ago, before all this, with a clear view. So we had a clear sense of where we wanted to go, so some of the efforts were clearly underway, and in some ways, when COVID hit, we weren’t fully done with all the changes we had wanted to make.

I think the irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see. Javier has a very, very long commute, and one of his biggest concerns was the commute when he was joining. He’s doing it all virtually now. But it is an important moment. Many schools, many organizations already use Google Meet. So we are doubling down.

“RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people.”

Obviously, COVID has blurred the lines between consumer and enterprise, and people are using products in all kinds of contexts. And so definitely, we are using it as an opportunity to make Google Meet and Google Chat, scale it up and make it more available.

And obviously, we are a service provider [but] we are a platform, too. Hence RCS and all the work we are doing. RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people. So it’s making better progress than it appears because you’re collecting so many people together on it. As people sign up, you will see more and more momentum.

So all of that is coming together well, I think. I’m glad we realigned it, everything with Javier. He works both with our cloud team with Thomas [Kurian], and our platforms team with Hiroshi. And so I think we’ll get to the right place. I’m very excited.

DB: You brought up RCS. You know I’m going to ask. What are the—

This is a rare moment where I am like... because I know Dieter wants to talk about it. So I had to go there.

DB: In an age when Facebook is saying, “We are going to integrate all of our messaging products, and we’re going to put everything under full end-to-end encryption,” do you think that Google having multiple products in multiple contexts is still the way to go? Or do you think there needs to be more integration there?

We definitely want to have a more integrated, simplified view, but in all scenarios, I see our platform offering. Android is open as part of the open platform stack. I think you need an open standard messaging framework. And we have to evolve that from its SMS days, and that’s RCS for me.

And obviously, we’ll continue doing that in all scenarios because I think that’s part of building that open stack. I don’t see that changing. But in terms of our services, I want it to be as simplified for people as possible. And I think we’ve made great strides compared to where we were with Google Meet and Chat. Of course, we have Duo. We intended Duo for consumers and Google Meet and Chat for businesses, effectively. But the lines have blurred. And they share a lot of common underlying technology. They’re both built on WebRTC, and so there’s a lot of common work, and given its common teams, hopefully we can iterate.

But some flexibility, I think it’s fine here.

NP: We started out by talking about phones. One of the reasons Apple’s phones are so sticky is they have a great messaging product. Do you think that that is connected? You need a great sticky messaging product to move people over?

Let me give a user answer and a technical answer, too.

From a user standpoint, any Android phone you get, you always want a phone number-based messaging product, which you’re going to create, and you want something which comes with the platform, and we’re trying to align that. And that integration, I think is critical. And so I do feel it’s an important part and where Android has been behind. So I think it’s important there.

Technically, different OEMs and different carriers having different RCS implementations was one of the biggest causes of fragmentation in Android. It caused real pain. So simplifying that is a tremendous multiplier in terms of productivity and efficiency and simplicity. And so for both reasons, I think, it’s important to invest, and get it right.

NP: So we lured you here by saying we were going to talk about the pandemic. We’ve mostly talked about messaging. I want to make sure we talk about the pandemic.

[Laughs] What a surprise.

NP: I feel like your team prepped you well. You had to know this question was coming. I keep track every week of when Trump and his team held up the flowchart and said, “Some x thousand Google engineers are working on it.”

Just walk me through that day. Did you expect that to come? The next day, Trump said someone from Google had called and apologized to him. Did that happen? Just what was that set of days like?

Very early on through COVID, we decided as a company we should do everything [in] areas where our expertise could help. And so we had a wide set of efforts.

I think there were two efforts, and we were in touch with the [White House] coronavirus task force. And there were two efforts, both in terms of what Google can do to provide more information, and Verily was working on a way to develop wide-scale testing, particularly with an emphasis on drive-through testing, with a focus on first responders. And we were in touch on both efforts. And so that’s what it was.

Today, I think Verily right now is in 86 sites across 13 states. And that’s what that effort was. It’s obviously taken more time than most of us expected to get there, but there were real constraints along the way. But I think we’ve made a lot of progress. My view on this is, at a time of global pandemic, we want to do everything we can to help the US government succeed. And so we’re trying to play our role in it.

NP: I’m just going to ask you directly: did you call President Trump and apologize?

My discussions were with the task force, so that’s who I was talking to.

NP: It’s quite a quote. It just struck me at that time that the distinction between Google and Verily was not being well-made. And so I think my follow-up here is: is that clearer now? You’re the CEO of Alphabet. Verily is under Alphabet. You’re also the head of Google.

I think we were communicating across two areas. We were communicating both. I do feel like the onus is on us as a company to clarify and be clear in terms of how we are communicating. I don’t think we got everything right in terms of communicating across the two groups, which were talking back and forth. So I just wanted to make sure we were clear in terms of how we were communicating.

NP: So what now is the relationship between Verily and Google? Do you still have volunteers working at the Verily project?

Yes. Because they’re both under Alphabet, we view it as areas where we help. So sometimes Google is doing work on health care, Verily is doing health care. If we share resources where we need to, sometimes there could be an AI breakthrough from Google, which is what Verily uses to commercialize. But at a technical level, we can exchange ideas. At a regulatory level, we work together to have a compliance process, and all that framework we built in. But I’m excited at the progress Verily is making as well.

DB: Do you find that separation, as sort of two separate companies under one umbrella, it’s still useful? Or has your thinking changed about the distinction between Alphabet company Verily and Alphabet company Google?

It’s a good question. There are many areas where I find the distinction to actually help because when you take something like Waymo, and the timeframe it needs to operate in, [it’s] dealing with a very different set of issues than building a typical internet product. I like the fact that there’s structural separation, that the Google management team doesn’t have to sit and think through that breadth, and they can be more focused. And it allows us to play these different bets with the different characteristics they would need and different time horizons and so on.

So Alphabet creates that flexibility. The underlying commonality across all of Alphabet is we think [there] has to be a deeper technology play — something based on some foundational technology to solve something. That’s the underlying commonality.

Google is broadly focused on the internet space, and you know if [a problem] is distinctly different from that, and allows us to still apply the technology — maybe share common things like AI and our data centers but have the right structure, right incentives, right approach to go tackle that problem. And so I think it’s been really helpful to have that flexibility. I would expect sometimes we may look at something and say, “Hey, it’s in Google. Maybe it makes sense to be more in Alphabet” or vice versa. We created that structure to create that flexibility. Nest is a good example. It made more sense that it’s aligned closer with the hardware team, and obviously, there’s convergence there.

NP: So there’s a couple big health initiatives inside the Alphabet umbrella. Verily is one of them. This is a moment, I think, for biotech, for health sciences. Would you say Verily is entirely now focused on COVID and the pandemic? Or is it one of many things it’s doing?

It’s one of many things. There are a lot of folks there who are doctors and health care people. Obviously, by calling, they feel motivated to help at a moment like that. So there is a lot of focus. But they’re focused on areas like diabetes, a longer-term disease. So they’re clearly focused on other aspects of health care as well, and they will continue doing that. And so those are big doubled-up efforts already underway.

NP: Google is doing a bunch of other stuff around the coronavirus and COVID-19. What are some of those other things outside of the website?

It’s a big part. By now, we’ve committed over a billion dollars in various ways, be it grants to public health organizations, ad credits to small / medium businesses, and then working in each country through the official agencies’ direct loan programs to small / medium businesses as well. We have undertaken efforts on PPE. There’s the deep work we have done on ventilators out of Rick’s team. And obviously, our support for schools through products like Meet. We have provided Chromebooks. So it spans a wide variety of effort.

And obviously, exposure notification, and the work in the contact tracing has a big effort, jointly with Apple as well.

NP: Is it not often that Google and Apple collaborate at this level. How did that come about? What was your conversation with Tim Cook like? How’s it going in terms of the two companies working together?

It’s been a really terrific effort. It started, I think both of us saw the problem and saw the opportunity to do something, and the teams had started working on it. And at the right point, you realize in this problem, particularly to do it well, we saw some of the earlier app efforts actually struggling to work well.

And so we realized as platform providers, we really want to make it easy, and to make it work at scale, obviously with user consent and privacy protection. And the teams started talking, they saw an opportunity to do it better, so Tim and I connected, and we talked, and we said, “Let’s announce it jointly.” That helps clarify that we are going to approach it consistently.

And so for public health organizations planning, we wanted to give a clear commitment and a framework that they can actually invest, and we’re going to support it as a platform.

The teams talk multiple times a week across the two companies, and we are in conversations with public health organizations around the world. You will see there are large countries where they are fully developing a service on top of it. Our goal here is to have one more toolkit in all the efforts you need to manage COVID. We wanted to make sure we created the option value and add one more step in that toolkit.

NP: When you’re on the phone with Tim Cook, what was a problem that needed the two of you to solve or decision that needed the two of you to make?

One example I would give, when Tim and I talked, it was mainly actually deciding to just go public and lay it all out, earlier than both companies would normally do in a process like this.

We would have probably normally waited to develop, hash out more issues fully. But we both realized, given the public nature of it, given the responsible conversation you need to have with many societal institutions as part of it, it was important that we put it out and shared details, and engaged in a conversation. So we basically made that decision, I think teams had maybe different timelines on when they should be announced. And so we talked through, and we decided to announce it sooner rather than later.

DB: You and I have talked previously about Google’s responsibility when it comes to AI and making sure AI was ethical. With this, you’re in the middle of a pandemic, you’re in the middle of a whole bunch of different countries with their own health organizations. How do you think about your responsibility as the CEO of Google in this pandemic? Because from a certain perspective, it rises to a governmental level of a social contract with users. Or you could say, “No, no. We’re just a tech company.” So how do you see that?

It’s a good question. It’s a one in 100-year kind of issue we are dealing with. So it’s important. I want to do everything we can [and] always be aware that we are a company, a private company, working through an extraordinarily public moment. We clearly have products, which people come and rely on, and so doing that well, both in terms of providing high-quality information and getting it right trumps everything as we handle that. And that is the biggest way by which we can do well.

Beyond that, supporting our employees, supporting the communities we operate in, all that goes hand in hand. And then there are longer-term efforts where, because we have deep technological underpinnings, we can bring that technology to bear to support health care organizations and so on. But that’s the way I think about it.

I think it’s an important moment where the big companies need to step up. But I think you need to do it in a construct in which you realize you’re a private company, and you’re one small part of big value chain to solve this.

NP: So that’s an interesting way of putting it because some of the problems you’re solving are new. We’re going to use the Bluetooth radios in everybody’s cellphone to do exposure notification. I think, historically, that’s a new idea. I don’t think people had that before. It’s obviously got a bunch of new problems to solve.

On the flip side, there are some very old problems to solve here. Are people getting reliable information? Can they trust their leaders? Can they trust the companies they rely on? Google obviously provides a lot of information in search. You provide a lot of information in YouTube.

There have been some massive coordinated disinformation campaigns on both of those platforms. Facebook just recently announced what amounts to a worldwide supreme court for free speech on its platform. Are you thinking you need to do something at that scale to manage the very old problems of reliable information on your platforms?

It’s the foundation of what our company is built on. Search was designed across the web to surface the highest-quality information. So it’s something we’ve thought about for a long time. Obviously, the challenges have gotten more complex and harder, for sure. And so we have evolved our approaches, too.

I’m following what everybody is doing with a lot of interest here. So for example, in YouTube, over the past maybe four years, we have definitely, for categories of information, relied on external experts. On violent extremism, we partner with counter-extremism organizations. So we tap their expertise to help shape our policies. And as we evolved our hate and harassment policies last year, we consulted many organizations. We took inputs.

So I think relying on deep experts, other nonprofit institutions, governmental expertise, is a natural way we want to approach our work. And so I think to me, whether you set up an oversight board — I will look to see what the learnings from it are, and definitely going to study that. I think it’s important to understand that.

I think we are going to be flexible. If we find something works, we will be really open to adopting it. But we also, I think directionally, have really worked hard to bring outside input in terms of policy definition and so on. So that’s how we generally think about it.

NP: I want to just ask about how you are managing Google. Vergecast listeners know I tend to end all these interviews by saying, “How do you manage your time?” And that question, it used to have one kind of very clear set of answers. Now, it’s all different. So as CEO of Google, you’re obviously managing a giant company remotely. You’re dealing with governments. You’re dealing with your own employees. How are you currently just managing your time operating the company?

I’ve tried to have two parallel tracks. One is explicitly, there’s a definite focus on COVID response. So I’m spending a significant chunk of my time on something like that, which I wasn’t spending two months ago.

But also making sure the company operationally is focused on continuing to pursue all efforts they are doing and being able to compartmentalize, and do that, too. And so I’m making sure that our meetings just have a real sense of normalcy, and that’s why I gave the example of the earlier morning meeting today when I was reviewing our product plan for next year. It’s just a normal meeting, which I would have done. And so being able to do—

NP: What surprised you in that meeting?

It is just — timelines are hard to plan around. Your disruptions are kind of concerning. So when you plan timelines — and they’re for sure hard — it’s not a surprise. It’s what was different about the meeting.

NP: I almost got you. I was this close.

[Laughs] Almost. That’s why I’m laughing.

NP: So you’re having meetings on sort of a normal cadence with a sense of normalcy. What else has shifted for you in how you’re managing your time?

The art of doing this, and I’m actually talking to others who have worked from home before, and the line I heard was, “Working from home is as much about not working from home, too.”

I think that’s been harder for IT. How do you draw the boundaries? I miss transitions giving me a chance to drive and think about stuff and process. And so on hand, it’s a bit more efficient because you can move across what we are doing right now might have taken a lot more time, maybe not as a podcast.

“I miss that space to think quietly.”

But I miss the transition. I miss that space to think quietly. And so for me, that’s definitely something I need to progress better. But I’m managing my time. I have a clear sense of the major areas in the company I want to spend a percentage of my time [on]. I actually look back at my calendar every three months to see whether I spent my time on the things I wanted to spend. And I’ve always done that. So any aberrations that come out, I step back and think, “What can I do structurally to make sure I get back to how I want to spend my time?”

So it’s a constant reiterative process. And sometimes you look back in horror, and you realize you got it wrong, and then you course-correct. So that’s how I think about it.

NP: So the classic question I ask is “When do you work?” Because it’s a question I’m very focused on. It sounds like you did a lot of your time working and thinking in those transitions. How are you building that time now? Or is that something you’re just working on?

It’s a good question. I’m trying to force-block times on the calendar, specifically to read and think. I think it’s hard to do. But actually block the time and do that.

That’s how I had the time to watch your Galaxy A51 video. Sometimes just trying to understand what’s going on and spend time outside. So I think carving out that thinking time is one tool I have. But drawing boundaries is something I’m working on as well. Definitely picking up hobbies, which I never thought I had before. I made pizza last week from scratch, thanks to some YouTube cooking video. It turned out okay. And so things like that help.

NP: As you look out over the course of this next year, over the course of the crisis unfolding, what are the leading indicators of change that you’re looking at that maybe other people aren’t looking at? Maybe that’s specific to Google, maybe it’s broader than that. But what are the signals that you see? You have access to a lot of signals. What are the signals you see that indicate change is coming, one way or the other?

It’s effectively user pattern shifts, trying to understand — is telemedicine a real thing? Does it sustain? Or is it just something people do, and do people revert back to how they do things.

So looking at recovery patterns and seeing where you’re actually seeing a difference, a long-run difference, is what we are trying to piece out and understand, where we can. And we’re very interested in how does work culture shift? How does travel and meetings shift for the long run? And hence its impact on things which will do well because of that, and things which will have to adapt. So shifts like that.

Education is a big area where we are watching, and definitely I know you’ve been passionate about rural broadband and connectivity. To me, distance learning really identifies those gaps, too. And so figuring out how through both connectivity and computing we reach those things, is a long-run journey, I think, which we’re working on.

But I think trying to get those snapshots of where things are changing and trying to be data-driven and adapt is something — I do think these are moments of opportunity as well to build a future. History shows through times like this because so many people are facing so many problems, entrepreneurs rethink things and solve things. So it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on.

NP: Do you see it differently around the world? You have access to a lot of data from around the world. Some parts of the world are in different states of this. What are you seeing around the world that is giving you an indication that things are going to change in the long term?

One thing, which has been striking is — I don’t think in our lifetimes we have seen such a global moment where everyone seems to be going through a shared experience. That’s unique. So it’s kind of one of the few positives. It feels like a moment for humanity together as a whole.

But for sure, when you look at places in Asia, which have gone through and come back, we do see some shifts in areas, like as people get used to ordering online, some of those effects seem — some of the shift stays. So we see trends like that. But I see a lot more common than not, which, to me, shows the commonality of humanity, more than how different we are. So there’s more common patterns I see rather than differences.",real
1780,355,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/fda-authorizes-2nd-blood-filtering-device-covid-19/,2020-04-17,FDA Authorizes 2nd Blood Filtering Device For COVID-19,"An emergency authorization was issued to Terumo BCT’s blood filtering device for COVID-19, and the agency has just done the same for CytoSorbent’s system; both are designed to filter out immune system proteins that fuel the cytokine storm reaction that is associated with the disease.

“We continue to work across all sectors to expedite the development of numerous innovative potential preventive and treatment approaches by both facilitating emergency access for patients, to the extent we can, and supporting the evaluation of potential therapies,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “With today’s authorization of a blood purification device, we are expediting the availability of a treatment option for patients in the ICU to help reduce the severity of the disease. Our staff will continue our around the clock review of all medical products to expedite the availability of treatments to help fight this devastating disease.”

The company’s CytoSorb purification system was previously cleared for use in the European Union to treat septic shock patients receiving intensive care as well as those undergoing heart surgery or those experiencing liver failure.

The FDA emergency authorization allows the filters to be used in American intensive care units for adults suffering from imminent respiratory failure with acute lung injuries or severe infection with COVID-19 disease.

As the body overreacts to the COVID-19 infection a cascading release of white blood cells creates a cytokine storm that can cause severe inflammation, tissue damage and rapidly progressive shock. These systems should help to filter out the proteins fueling the cytokine storm and help to save lives.

The company describes these filters as being plug and play compatible with most blood purification devices or pumps that can be found within an ICU such as dialysis or the lung supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation hardware machines.

""As a U.S.-based company with CytoSorb device manufacturing in New Jersey, we are eager to expand the availability of CytoSorb to U.S. hospitals and patients as a treatment option to fight cytokine storm and deadly inflammation that is believed to exacerbate COVID-19 infection,” said CytoSorbents CEO Philip Chan.

“With more than 555,000 documented coronavirus infections, the U.S. leads the world with over 22,000 deaths, and emergently needs new therapies to reduce the severity of this disease,” Chan added, as of early April 13. “This is important not just to reduce poor clinical outcomes and mortality, but to also alleviate the bottleneck for scarce resources such as ventilators and ECMO in the treatment of these critically ill patients.""

This system, according to the company, has been used in over 80,000 treatments overseas to assist with similar kinds of complications that are being seen in COVID-19, as well as with over 200 patients with this infection, and it is included in treatment guidelines in China, Italy, and Panama.

“Under the EUA, we plan to ramp the availability of CytoSorb in a controlled manner, to clinical centers that will work with us to generate data and leverage our knowledge of how to use the device most effectively,” Chan said.",fake
1781,1496,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/19/trumps-coronavirus-drug-white-house-reaction-269556,2020-05-19,Trump's drug surprise triggers a White House playbook: Defend and clean up,"Trump’s unsolicited announcement reflected the president’s personal concerns about the coronavirus, a threat he spent months publicly downplaying only to see it infiltrate his inner circle in recent weeks. He started taking the drug around the same time two White House staffers tested positive for the coronavirus. The decision also showed Trump’s penchant for bucking the establishment — in this case, an alarmed medical community that has been skeptical about hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness in helping combat coronavirus.

“I think that most people kind of expected he was on this or some other kind of prophylactic from the beginning,” said Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for Trump’s 2016 campaign and co-host of the podcast “War Room.” “You’ve got people in the White House who have got it, he’s shaking a number of hands, you look at someone like [British Prime Minister] Boris Johnson having it, and the fact that the president has been so healthy through this, people probably suspected he was on something.”

Many of the key questions about the president’s use of hydroxychloroquine remained unanswered Tuesday: How much he’s taking, how long he planned to take it and how it would interact with his existing heart medication. Trump's physician said only that he and the president had made the decision together.

Instead, throughout the day, Trump simply defended his use of the drug, saying he believed hydroxychloroquine “gives you an additional level of safety” and “doesn’t hurt people,” and said “people are going to have to make up their own mind” regarding the drug’s efficacy. The White House declined to comment beyond Trump's remarks.

“This is an individual decision to make,” Trump told reporters after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill. “But it’s had a great reputation, and if it was somebody else other than me, people would say, ‘Gee, isn’t that smart?’”

Yet recent research on the drug has not given it a great reputation for treating or preventing the novel coronavirus that has raced around the world, infecting upward of 1.5 million Americans and killing more than 90,000 of them so far.

In observational studies, the treatment has shown limited or no benefits for coronavirus patients, and may even cause heart problems like arrhythmia. And there are only limited results from studies on whether hydroxychloroquine could be effective as a prophylactic measure. More extensive studies are currently in the works.

Still, Trump has promoted the drug for weeks, encouraging Americans to take it. His proselytizing has led to a hydroxychloroquine shortage, which has had serious ramifications for people who have long used the drug to treat lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.",real

Safe to say very few of them had coronavirus in mind when they raised their right hand. By latest count, some 60,000 servicemen and women have been sent into action against this new enemy. But the military's number one mission has been to defend its own ranks against infection. It can't protect the nation if it can't defend itself. The aircraft carrier Roosevelt made headlines when the coronavirus ran roughshod through its crew. And there have been other outbreaks that required drastic measures to contain. The U.S. military was up against an enemy it could not see and did not understand.

Everything in the Army starts with basic training. And every day starts before dawn. But it never looked or sounded like this before.

Drill Sergeant David Castelow gives instructions for cleaning to prevent coronavirus. CBS News

Drill Sergeant David Castelow: Hard surfaces. Everything that your little hands touch. Everything! It's gotta get wiped down. Your beds – everything! If it's a hard surface it collects dust. You're gonna wipe it down. Do you understand?

RECRUITS: Yes, Drill Sergent!

It's not dust Drill Sergeant David Castelow is worried about. It's coronavirus. And that's why he takes every recruit's temperature first thing.

Drill Sergeant David Castelow: If your organization is infected by something like this, you know, these people, these initial entry trainees, are our combat power. So if they go down, or and if we can't do it safely, then we are rendering ourselves obsolete.

Coronavirus pandemic tests U.S. military planning

Last month, 63 recruits in a class of 940 here at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, tested positive for the virus and upended basic training.

Drill Sergeant Porter: You're going to do everything that I tell you. You do not move unless I tell you to.

That's not a recruit he's barking at. It's a four-star general, Army Chief of Staff James McConville.

Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville (right) goes back to basic training.

McConville took on the role of a recruit to witness the revamped training first hand after the coronavirus had forced the Army to stop taking in new soldiers.

Gen. James McConville: We took a two week pause.

David Martin: So for two weeks, you're not taking in any recruits?

Gen. James McConville: That's correct.

David Martin: Has that ever happened before?

Gen. James McConville: I'm not aware of any time – at least, in my 39 years where we stopped taking recruits in. But these are different times.

Training is still going on at Fort Jackson for recruits who arrived before the two-week pause. But now every soldier is wearing a face mask, loading up on hand sanitizer before moving into firing position and trying to stay six feet apart.

We call it ""social distancing."" The Army calls it ""tacticial dispersion.""

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: We have been executing socially distanced enabled training since week 2.



Either way, Lt. Col. Patrick Collins tells Gen. McConville it's a problem.

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet. Because, you tend to tell them, ""O.K. separate. Get your six feet."" You know, a couple minutes later, you know, just kind of natural human behavior. They start clustering again and you, and you, you've gotta tell them again.

Gen. James McConville

Nothing at Fort Jackson is natural anymore. The Army likes to say it has the best dressed soldiers in the world, but tailors who usually alter uniforms for a better fit are now turning out face masks.

Gen. James McConville: These just got here. These are brand new.

David Martin: Brand new?

And the single most important equipment McConville saw on his tour was a pair of high-speed COVID-19 test machines.

Col. Koenig: That'd give us the ability to test 750-plus in one day with a one-day turnaround. And then they go and we can then test that bubble also. We can continue to expand the bubbles of testing so that we can make sure we can cut it off right at the source, rather than watch it spread through a unit.

The chief of staff's job is to get the Army ready to fight. But these days, Gen. McConville told us he spends three quarters of his time trying to fight coronavirus to keep his soldiers healthy. Just six weeks ago he was sending heavy armor to Europe for one of the largest exercises since the Cold War.

Gen. James McConville: The toughest decision that-- that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20.

Defender 20 meant sending an entire division-sized force and its equipment to Europe, just as the virus was assaulting the continent.

Gen. James McConville: We just started war-gaming what would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers in a very close environment and, you know, and the virus broke out? How would we take care of them? And did we want to put our soldiers at that much risk for a training exercise? And we chose not to.

David Martin: You have to curtail training. You have to postpone major exercises. That's got to take a toll on the readiness of the Army.

Gen. James McConville: From where I sit, I'm looking at the long game, and the long game is that we have to protect the force to protect the nation.

David Martin: How big a price have you paid so far?

Gen. James McConville: I don't think we've paid a huge price yet. Am I concerned long term? Absolutely.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I'll be honest. It's been a little bit intimidating thinking about it. You train in your career to fight an enemy that you can see. This is one that you can't.

Air Force Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler, a fighter pilot, is about as far removed from basic training as it gets, underneath 1,500 feet of granite at this command post inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is a secure location that we intend to operate out of in wartime.

David Martin: Well, this is wartime, isn't it?

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is, but it's really a different kind of war.

Cheyenne Mountain was built to withstand a nuclear blast but every time a watch team makes this half-mile walk into the mountain, they risk bringing the virus with them. Which is why each team spends 14 days in quarantine before going on duty. When their watch starts.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: The first step you do is you start wiping down every surface, your computers, your telephones, your desk surfaces, door handles, etc. to make sure that all those are clean as well. It's a bit like an obsessive compulsive disorder (laugh). But we have to be able to make sure that there's no exposure to that virus.

Because our 60 Minutes team had not been quarantined, our cameras were not allowed inside the mountain. This footage was shot by the military. The interview was conducted from the Pentagon.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: When occasionally we have to bring somebody from outside into our bubble for work on an IT system, for example, we scatter like cockroaches. It's as if this is the most dangerous thing we've ever done in our careers. It's not being shot at. It's not flying combat. It's actually having somebody from outside the bubble arrive inside of here.

The command center at Cheyenne Mountain

This command center performs what Fesler calls a zero-fail mission: a 24/7 watch against a missile or bomber attack on the United States. Since the pandemic began, Cheyenne Mountain has scrambled jets to intercept Russian aircraft off the coast of Alaska three times.

David Martin: You think they were testing you at all to see if anybody was home at Cheyenne Mountain.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I suspect that the way that they look at those sorties probably is related to understanding our ability to operate in a COVID environment.

Cheyenne Mountain was ready for the Russians but not for the coronavirus.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: This is something new. This is something that we had to invent on the fly as our adversary was not exactly like the one we had planned to fight.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: There are so many aspects of what's going on now that are not things that we expected that we would be doing.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of the U.S. Northern Command, is the man in charge of defending the homeland. He had plans for dealing with all kinds of disasters, including a pandemic, but nothing on this scale.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Often we practice what we call the complex disasters, where we might have an earthquake, maybe, that hit multiple states and we consider those to be complex. And to have a national-- actual disasters declared in the 50 states and the responses happening with them, that is unprecedented.

David Martin: So, you know the old saying about plans, no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.

Despite all the top secret intelligence he sees, O'Shaughnessy did not have a good understanding of the virus.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.

Gen. John Hyten: We still don't fully understand the virus.

Gen. John Hyten

Gen. John Hyten is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the number two man in the military. Twice each day he holds a video conference with the pentagon's crisis management team located two floors below in the national military command center.

Gen. John Hyten: We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do, what a pandemic flu would do. And then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.

The nastiest surprise was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. Not only did the virus sideline one of the most important ships in the Navy but the majority of the more than 800 crew members who tested positive had no symptoms.

Gen. John Hyten: You think you finally start to understand it, and then you get data off the Theodore Roosevelt, of the very large number of asymptomatic cases. And then you try to understand whether the asymptomatic cases are contagious. How contagious are they? That's medical questions that we still don't fully understand the answers to.

Many of the answers depended on testing and the Pentagon had to use its transport planes to airlift millions of test swabs into the United States from Europe.

David Martin: From the outside looking in, it seemed like it was one emergency stopgap shipment of medical supplies after another. Was that what it was like on the inside looking out?

Gen. John Hyten: On the inside looking out I'll say it didn't look like an emergency but it was difficult. It was difficult to figure out exactly where to go. And then when we decided to move-- we had to move quickly to get it in the right place. But the one thing that we do really well is we move stuff.

The Army Corps of Engineers set up hospitals like this one at Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center all across the country, creating by last count about 15,000 beds in case local hospitals were overwhelmed.

David Martin: Were those hospitals the last line of defense?

Gen. John Hyten: We looked at it as the last line of defense.

David Martin: Where would the medical personnel to staff all those beds come from?

Gen. John Hyten: I have to be honest, we were worried about whether we'd run outta capacity early on when we were lookin' at those big numbers. It was not just space but, we were worried about doctors, nurses, corpsmen, respiratory therapists. We were worried about all those things.

David Martin: If this virus had not been slowed by social distancing, would the U.S. military have had the capability and capacity to defeat that virus?

Gen. John Hyten: That's what we were worried about. A situation where we woulda been basically mobilizing everything we had. It would been a different world. And I can't tell you right now how we woulda closed that.

It's a question the American military rarely has to ask itself, but the definition of what it takes to be a superpower has changed forever.

David Martin: So what will it take to get the military back to normal?

Gen. John Hyten: 2019 normal will never exist again. We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists. If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is gonna happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the-- for the other case, we're in a bad situation.

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place,"" Mariscal said in late April.

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would permanently close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC.

Other possible changes at Momofuku that Mariscal discussed in April include ending the tipped wage, recalibrating delivery fees, and diversifying business to make restaurants just one of many revenue streams.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Momofuku — a beloved restaurant empire that includes New York City's famed Momofuku Noodle Bar, upscale Momofuku Ko, and chicken-sandwich chain Fuku — isn't going to be the same when the coronavirus pandemic is over.

CEO Marguerite Mariscal told Business Insider that how Momofuku's mix of ""art and commerce"" translates in the ""next few months, a year, and beyond is still being written.""

""The last month has shone a light on some of the industry's practices that were previously barely tenable in the first place,"" Mariscal said in April. ""We are hopefully going to see a reform that will better position restaurants, even after there's a vaccine.""

Mariscal added: ""The worst thing a restaurant can do is go back to 'normal.' We need to all use this time to reevaluate industry standards.""

On Wednesday, Momofuku announced it would close two restaurants: Nishi in New York City and CCDC in Washington, DC. The company will also move the location of New York City's Ssäm Bar, combining the restaurant's staff with that of Wayō, which opened in 2019.

""Momofuku's guiding principle has always been that 'what got us here, won't get us there,'"" Mariscal wrote on Momofuku's website on Wednesday. ""Now more than ever, it is essential. This crisis has exposed the underlying vulnerabilities of our industry and made clear that returning to normal is not an option.""

Mariscal said in April that Momofuku was looking into changes included reexamining a tipped wage, which may no longer make sense when a larger percentage of revenue comes from takeaway. Delivery fees — which can be up to 30% of an order — may no longer be defensible as more customers order their food. And contactless delivery will somehow still have to inspire connection.

Mariscal said the pandemic has pushed Momofuku to diversify its business and approach restaurants as just one of multiple revenue streams.

""For us to take better care of our employees, we need to be profitable in and outside the four walls of a restaurant — whether that's through takeaway, products for the home, or content to cook along to,"" Mariscal said.

Mariscal became Momofuku Restaurant Group's first-ever CEO in 2019, taking the reins of the company from founder David Chang. Chang has emerged as an outspoken advocate for independent restaurants during the pandemic, highlighting the difficulties restaurants face, both during closures and as they consider reopening.

""There's a good chance Momofuku may never reopen again, or the restaurant that you love to go so much in your neighborhood will never reopen again if we don't support the supply chain and the purveyors and the farmers and the workers all surrounding it,"" Chang told Vice in April.

Mariscal said she expected the restaurant industry to evolve but the fundamentals to remain the same. People still want to ""celebrate and commiserate with those we love."" The industry's financials and operations will simply need to evolve to meet that need.

""The north star will remain the same — have someone leave our spaces better than when he or she walked in,"" Mariscal said. ""But we'll just need to reverse engineer how we get there.""",real

London will blare Islamic call to prayer during Ramadan as churches remain closed

The words in the Adhan state: ‘Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer. Come to salvation.’

By Paul Smeaton, May 19, 2020:

LONDON, May 19, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) – A London suburb totalling a mere 15 square miles in size and with a population of less than 300,000 people has granted permission for the first time to nine mosques to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer during Ramadan.

The news was published earlier this month in an article in The Metro, which included a video of the “Adhan” being chanted above from the roof of a mosque in Waltham Forest.

Waltham Forest is one London’s 32 boroughs, each of which has its own elected local council.

Clare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest Council, said that the Adhan being broadcast was “an alternative form of connection” for Muslims, with mosques currently closed along with all other places of worship in the U.K. as part of the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.

“Ramadan is normally a time for the Muslim community to come together to pray and break their fast,” she said.

“Like many aspects of all our lives, this has been affected by Covid-19 and the requirement to remain socially distant. As an alternative form of connection during this special month, the Waltham Forest Council of Mosques contacted the council to request that as an alternative to congregating they announce a short call to prayer at a number of mosques adapted to remind worshippers to stay at home,” she continued.

“The council considered the request as it would with any religious or faith group looking to responsibly worship during this difficult time. Ramadan Mubarak to all our Muslim community.”

The Adhan will be broadcast each day at sunset, with an additional broadcast each Friday. The words in the Adhan state: “Allah is the greatest. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer. Come to salvation.”

Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the senior Catholic cleric in the U.K., marked the beginning of Ramadan by joining a host of religious leaders in an interfaith event titled “Ramadan at Home,” organised by the Naz Legacy.",fake

Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world, said it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries. Bird said it would halt operations in six US cities as well as all of its European markets. And Spin, which is owned by Ford, has had to pause service in “very few” cities and universities.

The decisions to suspend service reflect the rapidly changing environment in the US and around the world in response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Just three days ago, Lime was the only scooter company to halt operations in two US states and three European countries.

Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts

Now, with “shelter-in-place” orders, social distancing, and most people simply staying at home, scooter companies are likely seeing a steep drop in demand. The timing of the pandemic is also posing a challenge for the money-losing scooter business, that sees its business slow down in the winter and pick back up again when the weather turns warm.

Lime, with roughly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, is making the most drastic cuts. The company said it was “winding down or pausing” service in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

The company’s scooters remain available in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Brisbane, Australia; Busan, South Korea; Christchurch, New Zealand; Dunedin, New Zealand; Hamilton, New Zealand; Selwyn District, New Zealand; Seoul, South Korea; and Sydney, Australia.

Bird said it is pausing service in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Portland, Miami, and Coral Gables. The company has also pulled its scooters from all of its European markets, which includes Annecy, Antwerp, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Krakow, Lisbon, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, Paris, Rimini, Sevilla, Stockholm, Torino, Verona, and Vienna.

“The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale.”

“The COVID-19 pandemic is undeniably affecting countless lives on a global scale. Given our deep understanding of and empathy towards the cities, communities and people we serve, we are temporarily pausing our service in a variety of cities,” a spokesperson said. “This is very fluid as the response to COVID-19 evolves and is in line with voluntary, as well as mandatory measures set by local governments for businesses.”

In contrast, Spin says it has been asked to “step up” by some cities to help “fill transportation gaps after the public bus system was shut down.” The Ford-owned company says it was designated as an “essential service” during the city’s shelter-in-place order “and encouraged to continue operations as a healthy mobility option.” Still, Spin said it has also paused operations “in very few markets,” either because a city requested it or because a university campus has been shut down. (A spokesperson didn’t specify which cities it had paused service.)

For the remaining scooters still available to rent, all of the companies say they have stepped up their sanitizing efforts and instituted new workplace protocols for employees to ensure social distancing in the warehouses that are still opened.

Lyft is still offering scooters to rent in San Francisco, but it halted operations in Miami at the request of the city. Jump, which is owned by Uber, didn’t respond to requests for comment. According to Streetsblog, Jump has only paused scooter operations in Sacramento, California. Last month, Lyft said in a regulatory filing that the outbreak in China has led to production delays of certain automotive parts and components of bikes and scooters.

Scooter-sharing isn’t the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic

Scooter-sharing isn’t the only mobility service to suffer due to the pandemic. Public transportation ridership has cratered and fare revenue has practically dried up. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are also seeing precipitous drops in gross bookings in cities hit hard by the disease. Three weeks of social distancing and warnings to stay at home have taken a huge bite out of the total number of trips taken with all modes of transportation.

But as people avoid transit and shared modes of travel, the silver lining seems to be the number of personal mobility trips that are rising. In New York City, for instance, cycling traffic on the East River bridges is up over 50 percent and Citi Bike ridership is up almost 70 percent compared to this time last year. But city officials aren’t doing enough to protect those riders who are switching to bikes; cyclist injuries were up 43 percent between March 9th and March 15th, according to NYPD statistics obtained by Streetsblog.

Cities have a unique opportunity during the pandemic to remake their streets to better prioritize these low-carbon forms of transportation. “While staying at home and following government recommendations for social distancing is the first order of priorities, if you have to take a trip and do not want to ride public transport, or if public transport has reduced service, the bicycle can be a good alternative,” Virginia Tech transportation expert Ralph Buehler said in an email.",real
1818,0,https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html,2020-01-21,The Coronavirus: What Scientists Have Learned So Far,"
A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.
Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.
Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.
At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.
Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.
The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.
Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.
“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
How is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.
Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.
The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.
People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.
Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.
Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.
Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.
When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.

What symptoms should I look out for?Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.
Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.
If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.
Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.
In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.
The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.

Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.
A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.
How long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)
By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.
Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.
How can I protect myself?The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.
But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”
Should I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.
Is it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.
In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.
But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”
“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.
There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.
But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.
“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”

1822,603,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248095/coronavirus-case-deaths-national-data-black-african-american-counties,2020-05-05,A majority of coronavirus deaths in the US were in disproportionately black counties,"Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black, according to newly released data that is still being reviewed by scientists. The numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are also higher in counties with a bigger proportion of black residents, the new analysis shows.

Only 22 percent of counties in the United States are disproportionately black, but the people within them have endured the majority of deaths in the country. These findings are the most comprehensive evidence we have yet showing how the novel coronavirus is taking a heavier toll on African Americans since national demographic data on race has so far been incomplete. An accurate picture of who is hardest hit is needed so that these disparities don’t play out again when it comes to who can get a vaccine and treatments as these become available, researchers say.

“We might see history repeat itself”

“Unfortunately, we might see history repeat itself when a vaccine becomes available,” Gregorio Millett, the study’s lead investigator, said in a press call. “That’s why it’s important to have studies like this and other studies that come out to show where COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are concentrated to make sure that these marginalized populations are among the first to have access.”

This study was released today on the website of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research to allow other scientists to comment on it. The results may change before it is finalized and published. The foundation worked in collaboration with Emory University, Johns Hopkins, O’Neill Institute, Georgetown University, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They analyzed data on the pandemic collected on or before April 13th.

The racial breakdown of COVID-19 cases has trickled out from states and cities since March. More than 80 percent of coronavirus patients hospitalized in Georgia were black, according to a recent sample taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 305 patients. That’s despite black residents making up less than one-third of the population. But the CDC’s national data is still missing the races of more than 55 percent of COVID-19 cases nationwide.

Lawmakers have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to collect racial and ethnic demographics. “Lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” they wrote in a March 27th letter to the agency. “Existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.”

“the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally”

More than 90 percent of the disproportionately black counties studied are in the South. But the researchers found that cases and deaths were higher in African American communities, regardless of whether the area was more rural or more urban.

In New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, there are stark differences in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths by county, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Bronx has the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and higher death and hospitalization rates than New York City’s other boroughs, which each have their own counties. Manhattan is predominately white, and it has the lowest rates for deaths and hospitalizations.

The new national study also highlighted that rates of being uninsured, living in crowded households, and being exposed to more air pollution were also higher in counties that were disproportionately black — all factors associated with making it harder for these communities to stay healthy. These counties were also less likely to social distance compared to other counties, based on location data from cellphones. The study also noted that African Americans are more likely to be essential workers who aren’t able to work from home, despite shelter-in-place orders.

While the data is still emerging, it’s not necessarily surprising to public health experts who have worked to end racial disparities in a broad range of health outcomes that are a result of long-standing economic and social barriers. “It’s the social conditions that we have created,” says, David Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard, told The Verge in April. “I hope this is a wake up call for America.”",real

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse.

He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future.

I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now.

And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing.

There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask.

I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore.

I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important.

I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures.

I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home.

I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces.

But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary.

Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary.

And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing.

So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government.

They already have permission because they have inalienable rights.

It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

After starting the season in the NHL before getting sent to the Wolves in November, Pirri had earned his third Vegas recall in the last month and seemed to be back in the Golden Knights’ plans.

Then the pandemic stopped the season and Pirri’s latest shot in the NHL. But Pirri, 29, is keeping it all in perspective.

“I am aware of what’s going on,” said Pirri, who was sent back to the Wolves on March 14. “It was good to be back up, but at the same time it’s a game. It’s a sport, and wherever I am I get to play hockey for a living, and I feel very fortunate. Health and safety is everything, and it is what it is. I’m sure I’m not the only guy going through this, and to be kind of frustrated by it isn’t going to do me any good, or basically anyone else, because it’s just a matter of getting through this time and taking care of one another.”

Pirri has spread that message through All In Illinois, a state initiative stressing the importance of sheltering at home. Pirri recorded a television commercial for All In, lending his voice along with luminaries such as Hillary Clinton, Common and Chance the Rapper, and sports figures like Mike Singletary, Patrick Kane, David Ross, Jim Thome and Toni Kukoc. During the 56-second spot, Pirri says he’s really happy to live in a state that has taken the pandemic so seriously, talks about how many of life’s biggest moments took place in Illinois, and said “us non-essential workers need to stay home and do our part together.”

Pirri said he was asked through the Wolves to participate and hopes his voice could influence people to be safe and help stop the spread of the virus. After all, Pirri is going through this just like everyone else. He even had to tell his two-year-old son, Luca, that the park was closed.

“I saw Kaner did it, so if people are listening to him, that’s huge,” Pirri said. “The more people that can get behind this, the sooner we all can get through it, because the whole flatten-the-curve idea seems to be the only way we’re going to get back to our normal lives. I was asked to do it, and that’s an easy ask.”

If the curve is flattened, maybe the season can continue in some form. When the season was halted, Pirri indicated he thought the games would return and that a solution could be found somewhat quickly. But as more information came out, he came to the realization this wouldn’t be over quickly.

“At first I was thinking stay ready, and now [I’m] waiting it out like everyone else,” Pirri said. “Obviously, there’s only so many pushups and situps you can do, but that’s just kind of the way it is right now. It would be great to be playing hockey, but the world’s got to figure out a bigger issue right now.”",real

Special to USA TODAY

The coronavirus pandemic has upended the personal finances of millions of workers and their loved ones. And one recent trend is of particular concern.

Many workers who have been furloughed or laid off are now strapped for cash. And they're considering borrowing money from their 401(k) instead of using other sources of funds.

Advisers recommend tapping all other sources of money before borrowing from your 401(k).

“Please stay away from retirement accounts,” says Chris Chen, a certified financial planner with Insight Financial Strategists. “The long-term damage is absolutely horrible.”

The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which is closing businesses and forcing millions out of work, makes it even less appealing.

“We like to use 401(k) loans as a last resort, especially in a challenging financial environment,” says Dan Galli, a certified financial planner with Daniel J. Galli & Associates.

No match:My company just stopped their 401(k) match. What should I do?

Wall St. vs. Main St.:Here's why the market is better than the economy right now

Reason to avoid 401(k) loans

Galli also advises against 401(k) loans for this reason:

Plan sponsors, according to the IRS, may require an employee to repay the full outstanding balance of a loan if he or she terminates employment or if the plan is terminated. And that could put even more financial stress on your finances if you’re already desperate for living expenses.

Even worse: If you, the employee, are unable to repay the loan, then your employer will treat it as a distribution and report it to the IRS.

“The country is littered with stories about folks that took 401(k) withdrawals with every attempt to pay the money back, but never got around to it,” says Charles Sachs, a certified financial planner with Kaufman Rossin Wealth. “Imagine the lost growth over a 20-, 30- or 40-year period. If people think they have it tough now, they should imagine when they are in their 80s without the benefit of a nice sized 401(k).”

One bit of good news: You, the employee, can avoid the immediate income tax consequences by rolling over all or part of the loan’s outstanding balance to an IRA or eligible retirement plan by the due date for filing the Federal income tax return for the year in which the loan is treated as a distribution.

What to tap instead

So, where might you find money for living expenses? Well, for starters consider that each option has its pros and cons.

But in the main, borrowing from family, a home equity line of credit and credit cards should be used before borrowing from a 401(k), says Galli.

Thomas Scanlon, a certified financial planner with Raymond James, also recommends tapping your Roth IRA. “Your contributions to the Roth IRA can be withdrawn any time, income tax and penalty free,” he says. “This is because the contributions go in after tax.”

If you’re owed a refund, file your 2019 tax return right away. That’s another source of cash, says Rita Cheng, a certified financial planner Blue Ocean Global Wealth. Likewise, follow up on your stimulus check if you haven’t received that yet.

And, for some, accessing the cash value in your life insurance is another source of funds, says Cheng.

You might be able to take a hardship distribution from your 401(k) plan. Typically, it’s allowed for an immediate and heavy financial need, and limited to the amount necessary to satisfy that financial need. But experts generally advise against this tactic. That's because because you will have to pay taxes on the distribution, and you can’t pay the distribution back into your 401(k).

Bottom line: List all your available options and create a plan that will best position you to weather a difficult storm, says David Mullins, a certified financial planner with David Mullins Wealth Management Group.

When a 401(k) loan is the best option

To be fair, a 401(k) loan may be the best option, depending on the expected need and the length of time, and what other options are available. But remember “you are pulling from funds in a down market and missing out on a potential recovery,"" says David Shotwell, a certified financial planner Shotwell Rutter Baer. ""It may be less interest cost, but the long-term cost can be much greater.”

The right way and the wrong way: If you borrow money from your 401(k) plan, there are best practices to follow. When you take a loan, you are selling securities, says Leon LaBrecque, a certified financial planner with Sequoia Financial Advisors. And given that, Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner with American Financial & Tax Strategies, advises against taking the money on a pro-rata basis across all investment options but rather specify which ones, probably cash or bonds, will be sold.

The Cares Act: According to Ed Slott, a CPA with Ed Slott and Company, the CARES Act increases the maximum loan amount for qualified individuals to the lesser of $100,000 (reduced by other outstanding loans) or 100% of the account balance, and, two, allows qualified individuals to take up to $100,000 of penalty-free coronavirus-related IRA and company plan distributions during 2020. If you’re a qualified individual, either the loan or distribution could be a source of funds for living expenses.

1860,844,https://blog.heartland.org/2020/05/the-coronavirus-and-the-attack-on-liberty-and-privacy/,2020-05-13,The Coronavirus and the Attack on Liberty and Privacy,"The coronavirus crisis has, once more, reminded us all of how much we live in an interdependent world in which what happens in one part of the globe has serious impacts in many other places, and how each of our own actions potentially have implications and importance for the well-being of multitudes of others around us, both near and far. The question is, what societal arrangement is most likely to effectively and successfully assure cooperative coordination of all that we are doing?

Dr. Diane Coyle, professor of economics at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, believes that the coronavirus pandemic demonstrates the need for greater politically organized collective action, both in the current crisis and looking ahead. She argues in, “Covid-19 and the End of Individualism,” that the market economy has met its match, and political paternalism in the forms of regulation and control is needed in its place, more than ever.

However, some of us would reply that it is precisely because of our mutual interconnectedness in a global division of labor and exactly because each of our individual actions have influences on the well-being of others that we need to utilize a system of open, competitive markets even more than before to overcome the personal and societal effects from the coronavirus.

Social Interdependency and Government Big Data Collection

The dramatic decline in overall production around the world, along with the accompanying massive rise in unemployment almost everywhere shows, Dr. Coyle says, that Adam Smith was right that the division of labor has the capacity of making all participants better off. But the interdependency of specialization highlights that “what affects some parts substantially affects the whole. This web of linkages is therefore a vulnerability when disrupted.”

Modern technologies have intensified the possibilities of spillover effects, she says, because of the “sophisticated logistical networks and just-in-time supply chains. The very nature of the digital economy means that each of our individual choices will affect many other people.”

The new age of potential “big data” collection and the need to make it as comprehensive as possible to enable “global” and collective policy decisions by governments means that individual privacy must be given a lower priority so those in political authority can know enough about the nature, transmissions, and impacts of the coronavirus to design and implement effective government responses to the epidemic, including the planning of any moving out of the politically imposed lockdowns.

Dr. Coyle states, “This approach will be effective only if a high enough proportion of the population uses the same app and shares the data it gathers . . . No app will be effective if people are unwilling to provide ‘their’ data to governments rolling out the system. If I decide to withhold information about my movements and contacts, this would adversely affect everyone . . . In the current circumstances, the collective goal outweighs individual preferences.”

Rationalizing the Need for Government to Know Everything

The implication is fairly clear: Everyone in the country (in the world!) must be required to download government-chosen apps on their respective mobile devices; they must allow the apps to collect whatever personal information is considered essential for tracking the movements and activities of the individuals in question; and permit his and her data to be sent and integrated with all the information transmitted from everyone else. The government will, then, use this data to determine the best policies and their timing for responding to the coronavirus crisis, and presumably any other social and economic targets aimed for in the future.

The wider context, therefore, of Dr. Coyle’s analysis and proposal is that national and global interdependencies lead to the conclusion that beyond the current health crisis, governments and others associated with governments should have the latitude to collect and utilize a wide variety of bits of information about everyone, everywhere, all the time.

Otherwise, you or I or anyone else might do something as consumer or producer, buyer or seller, proponent or recipient of ideas, attitudes, and actions that might have potentially unwanted or undesired impacts on others, somewhere, that might be considered by someone in the data retrieval and analysis authority to need some type of government policy response.

Now, I am confident that if the argument was expressed to Dr. Coyle in this way, she would respond that I am reading too much into it. First, the data can be collected and utilized in ways that leave individuals “anonymous” in terms of from whom it has been ultimately collected. And, its purpose is only for determining and tracing out aggregate trends and patterns found relevant in some way for various policy purposes important for social coordination, stability, or betterment.

Governments Knowing Everything Can Control Everyone

Let us not forget that such things as social coordination, stability and betterment are not independent of the eyes of the beholder, and especially in the arena of public policy-making since whatever the government does potentially impacts large numbers if not everyone in society. Nor it is free of the changing historical circumstances of who is in political power with access to and use of such data. Such concerns and suspicions are not merely hypotheticals held by those who may be extraordinarily sensitive about individual liberty and privacy matters

Just look at China, where over the last few years, the communist government has been setting up a “social credit system,” under which Chinese citizens are expected to download and keep active and accessible to the political authorities an app on their mobile devices that surveils everything they do and say, everywhere they go and with whom, every purchase and use they make of all that incorporates the affairs of ordinary everyday life.

The “good” Chinese citizens are “credited” with those activities, interactions, and purchases that the government deems to be in the social and national interest, “credits” that give individuals various perks and benefits. Those found to have acted and interacted in ways viewed by the government as “anti-social” can experience limited opportunities for travel, difficulties in purchasing an apartment, or obtaining better employment. Combined with China’s “state-of-the-art” facial recognition technology increasingly surveilling intersections, streets, alleys and highways through the country, along with drone patrols overhead, Big Brother is not a futuristic fantasy. It is here – now.

This is not just being done in China. In the name of fighting terrorism and crime, and now in the name of the needed surveillance of anti-social distancing behavior, the same technologies of tracking mobile devices and facial recognition technologies are increasingly being used in Europe, the United States and other parts of the world, and have been for a while.

In the current coronavirus crisis, such technology is being used across the U.S. to rank states and counties within states from an “A” to an “F” in terms of traced movements and interactions by people in abiding by “social distancing” rules and restrictions; this includes tracking of how many hours people have been “socializing” or communicating with each other. Also being traced are how much time is spent in sports, exercise and recreational activities while people are locked down in their homes and immediately surrounding environments. In addition, mobile devices are used to register the new patterns and amounts of consumer expenditures under the imposed shopping and other restrictions.

Private Sector Collection of Personal Data

For a good while, now, friends of freedom and civil libertarians in general have been concerned with the collection, storing, use and sharing of personal data via the apps and social media sites used by virtually everyone. There have been reasonable and serious discussions and debates about the right or acceptability of private firms on the internet sweeping up the details of their users’ activities, and using that information through the application of various algorithms in determining people’s spending habits and patterns, their interests and pursuits, their political and social values based on what they search for and read online, as well as a wide variety of other activities.

Most social media sites provide access and use for free; but there are no free lunches in the real world. If costs of offering such services are to be covered and profits possibly earned, then the social media providers must have something to sell to third parties to earn advertising and other revenues. Old-fashioned network television, before paid satellite and cable services, required viewers to put up with frequent commercial breaks while watching any show so the three major networks could earn advertising revenues, since the airwaves were accessible in every household for “free.”

Yes, I am sometimes annoyed when the streaming services I subscribe to decide what shows and films I’m interested in watching from my past viewing choices, and post their “picks” for me when I would like to just look around myself on their site without their “recommendations.” But I have sometimes discovered movies that it turns out I am interested in seeing due to their viewer “profiling” of me. Likewise, I am irritated when a search engine or a social media site decides what news or political sites fit my “profile” based on their algorithms.

I also assume that they use the information they glean from my viewing patterns for other profitable purposes. But I, personally, care less about that than the gains from the market availability of such streaming services compared to when, years ago, I was limited to what the three major networks offered based on the lowest common denominator of taste that could attract the widest audiences across America under the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations on content and language.

Big Government Makes Big Data a Threat to Liberty

I wish to make clear that I do not discount or consider illegitimate or unimportant the types of concerns people have about the data mining of all of us in these ways. But whatever the pros and cons of permitted and restricted use of such information by and in the private sector, the greatest danger is the collection or acquisition of all that “big data” by government.

I can opt in or out in using some social media sites or doing more or less of my shopping online through various apps or sharing my social and political views with people on particular internet outlets. But unless I really want to go totally “under the radar” with a completely non-internet presence, including with no mobile devices or online computer uses, I cannot even attempt to fully escape from the prying eyes of government. It is the government and its use of any such data that it collects or can strong-arm private media and internet sites to share that is the most serious danger and threatening intrusion into our individual liberty and privacy.

But these are the types of information for “collective action” that someone like Dr. Diane Coyle seems to want governments to have access to and be able to use. It is a strange social psychology in our day and age that both political conservatives and “progressives” want governments to have such informational collection and use authority. Now, it is true, they see its desirability and application in different ways, but many in both groups see it as necessary for the asserted national or social good.

Conservatives and “Progressives” Both Want to Deny Privacies

Conservatives most often see the need for it in terms of national security to fight terrorism or to combat drug smugglers or to prevent “illegal aliens” from entering the country without government passport and visa permission. “Progressives” champion it to fight “hate crimes” or human traffickers (under the presumption that everyone in the sex business is a victim or a “slave”) or to enable the overseeing of social services concerning, say, health care or presumed environmental abuse, or, in the latest instance, for government to decide on and implement policy in the face of the coronavirus.

Combined, the conservative and “progressive” variations in favor of technological surveillance add up to leaving little in any person’s life being outside of the prying eyes of government. Of course, both conservatives and “progressives,” respectively, insist that its purpose is only for the national or social interest, with no intention of abuse – unless, of course, the power over its use is in the hands of the “other” group.

But that is the point: You can never know for sure who in the next electoral cycle will be the “democratic” choice that gains access to the reins of political power and therefore will have the use of those informational tools to spy on anyone or everyone. When discussing with my students the desirable limits to government authority in society, I often ask them to think of the answer to the following question: Who is the politician they trust the least and hate the most? Now imagine that that person is the one in control of all that technological surveilling power. Would they want that person to have it and to use it?

That is the reason why thoughtful people concerned with human liberty and fearful of abuse by those in political power have long argued for constitutions that narrowly define, determine and delineate the functions and responsibilities of government and those elected or appointed to serve in some capacity in its various branches. It is the only way to assure a rule of law instead of a rule of men.

The wider the governmental responsibilities over aspects of our lives, the more the discretionary authority that must come with it. That also means the greater its use in ways that deny and abuse freedom instead of protecting people’s individual rights to their life, liberty and honestly acquired property, including the right of peaceful association both within the marketplace and outside of it in the other institutions of voluntary civil society.

Free Markets Overcome the Conflict Between Individuals and Society

Fundamental to Dr. Coyle’s view is a dichotomy and a tension that she sees between the individual and society. It is certainly the case that throughout history, individuals through the use or threat of private or political force have attempted to use and abuse others for their own gain.

Marauding bandits or conquering kings and princes seized and laid claim to the lands and properties of their victims, and often enslaved those they found it advantageous not to kill. Here in stark contrast was the conflict between the individual and other members of society. The use or the intimidation of physical force enabled some to make others obey and serve.

Since Dr. Coyle refers to Adam Smith and the benefits to all in society from the greater productivity and wider variety of things made possible by division of labor, it is almost embarrassing to have to remind her of the social and institutional context in which Smith explained how this all became possible for a growing circle of participants.

In the market society, individual interest and gain are harnessed to the betterment of others in society precisely by making it necessary for each to associate in what Smith called a “system of natural liberty,” under which each collaborates and cooperates on the basis of voluntary agreement and mutual again. If I cannot kill you, or rob or defraud, or make you my slave, then the only way I can obtain what you have is by offering you something in exchange that makes it worthwhile and advantageous for you to enter into a transaction with me.

As Smith famously said, the essence of every trade is, if you give this to me which I want, I will give you something else in exchange that you desire. It is through this method of human association that we receive the benefits of the abilities, talents, and productive possibilities of all the other members of society; just as they, in turn, gain what we can do for them.

The more extensive and intensive the division of labor, the more dependent each of us is upon multitudes of people who we personally know little or nothing about. We are strangers to each other, whether we are strangers in parts of the same town or city, or across national boundaries and halfway around the world.

Market Prices and Personal Data to Coordinate Everyone’s Actions

What connects us is precisely the social network of markets, prices, and local and international competition. The supply-chains of resources, production, wholesale delivery and retail sale are all kept in structured and coordinated order through the information and incentives provided through the price system, and the networks of localized data about people and markets that interconnect to serve the personal purposes of each attempting to do the best they can as buyer and seller, consumer and producer, and employer and employee in their respective corners of the world.

Businesses want various types of collected data to complement and to fill in the details that prices and other market informational sources provide so they may make more informed and forethoughtful decisions on what and how to produce, with the hope of profits instead of losses. If our privacy seems to be being pried into, private enterprises in the market use that data to get better “pictures” of us as individuals and subgroups in society as potential buyers of existing or new and better goods and services they are attempting to make attractive for us to be willing and interested in purchasing.

Yes, private businesses try to influence all of us in trying to find out what we want or are interested in, and in what ways advertising and offering us goods and services are more likely to get our attention and the spending of our dollars in their direction rather than someone else’s.

Rationalizing Paternalism by Assuming Others are Irresponsible

But while private enterprises may try to sway us through what they learn about us, they cannot compel us to buy what they are trying to sell. Unless we think of ourselves as mindless and passively responding automatons, we all have the capacity to look before we leap, to say “No” rather than saying “Yes” to everything a seller says or offers. Most of us assume that in most instances we are more intelligent than that.

We too often give into the presumption of a seller’s mind control over others because we too easily assume that while we can usually see through any influencing manipulation, it is the other person who is too weak-minded and thoughtless to be trusted with the latitude and liberty to say yes or no on his own. So, “we” need the political overseer because others in society cannot be trusted with the freedom to choose on their own. We support and call for it, often, because of our concerns for the irresponsibility or ignorance of others in society.

Of course, in many instances those others are thinking the same about us and support the same political paternalism because they consider us to be too unenlightened to live and choose on our own without that political protecting and guiding hand. So, each thinks freedom must be denied, to one extent or another, because each thinks the other to be too weak-minded to have a fuller liberty, while each rarely thinks of themselves as needing that same government control over their choices and actions. If only there was a way for each to retain their freedom while the others who need that watching over are given the government’s restricting and regulating helping oversight!

The fundamental problem is that governments do not “reason” with people to get them to follow what those in government want others to do or not to do. Government forces our compliance through their legitimized authority to use coercion. Don’t follow social distancing decrees and you may be fined or arrested, including because you jogged in a park, or took a walk on a beach, or shopped for or offered something the political authority insists you should not.

The More Government Controls in Society, the Big Data Needed

Why does government need that “big data?” Without it, how can government know enough to assure that we do not do things they don’t want us to do? Examples are the ones we mentioned earlier: trying to stop illegal drug dealing or to prevent “hateful” thoughts or actions. That is, to prohibit or restrict actions that may not involve private uses of force or fraud, but which those in political power declare to be “bad” for us or harmful to others if we are allowed to do it or say it.

The big data also is wanted because the government’s reach has extended into many aspects of life which in a freer society would not be the concern of those in elected or appointed political office. Government needs to know our eating, drinking, exercising and related social habits because government has already taken over so much authority and control over the health industry and the medical health insurance business.

Government oversees our retirement, our workplace wages and work conditions, the forms and types of goods we produce and consume, the way we grow and market crops, the way we manufacture goods for domestic and foreign sale. Also increasingly in the purview of government is how we interact with others in our words and deeds, including how many of us there are in various social, gender, ethnic and racial groups because how else can government monitor and manipulate the association of people into patterns the political paternalists know to be better or even best?

The big data is needed, therefore, to more heavy-handedly make us act in ways wanted or to “nudge” us in the desired directions through manipulation of the right fiscal or regulatory incentives to get the responses out of us that those in and around government just know to be “good for us.”

Getting us to accept and even support more of this government intrusion and data mining into our private affairs is one of the great dangers facing us in the coronavirus crisis. It is why it is important not to fall into the trap of thinking, as Diane Coyle wants us to, that this pandemic should be taken to mean “the end of individualism.” It should, instead, remind us of the dangers from and the need to impose limits on government at all levels.

The “individualism” that Dr. Coyle scornfully criticizes is really the liberty of each one of us to more fully design and direct our own lives in peaceful and mutually productive associations inside and outside of the marketplace, rather than turning that freedom over to the political paternalists desiring to tell us how to live, think and act, and, of course, all for our own good.

‘Many, Many Others’ Affected by Obama-Era Surveillance, Says Former CBS Reporter Sharyl Attkisson

By Rudy Takala, Mediate, May 21st, 2020, 4:44 pm

Four years after the intelligence community began to surveil some of President Donald Trump’s campaign officials, details of what that surveillance entailed are still emerging. The Justice Department is still waiting on U.S. Attorney John Durham to finish investigating. The president this month even assigned it a new nickname: “Obamagate.”

For many observers, the idea that the intelligence community would flout certain rules in order to investigate American citizens is news. But for former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, “Obamagate” is just the latest development in a nearly decade-long battle.

“I would say I may not be one of the first victims, but I am one of the first people who was able to identify myself as a target of illegal spying under the Obama administration,” Attkisson told Mediaite in an interview this week. “I believe many, many others were spied on but do not know. It was only thanks to help from intelligence contacts that I even learned that government agents were spying on me. Otherwise, I never suspected it or would have known.”

Attkisson has long asserted that the feds wrongfully surveilled her electronic devices from 2011-14, part of an operation tied to her reporting on the Justice Department’s botched “Fast and Furious” gun-running scheme and, later, on the 2012 attack on the American embassy in Benghazi, Libya. A three-judge panel voted last year to dismiss a lawsuit she had filed over the issue, but in January, Attkisson moved to reopen the case, telling the court that a whistleblower had provided new information.

That information implicated five specific individuals, according to court filings — including Rod Rosenstein, a familiar target of Trump’s grievances. Court filings allege Rosenstein, who served as the Obama administration’s U.S. attorney for Maryland, “ordered the unlawful surveillance and hacking” of Attkisson’s devices. (He subsequently served as Trump’s deputy attorney general, a capacity in which he appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump’s staffers.)

Rosenstein has denied the charges, arguing that the case should not be allowed to proceed based on information from an anonymous informant. “Nowhere do the Attkissons provide any more information to credit their accusations based on this supposed anonymous source,” Rosenstein’s attorneys wrote in an April motion to dismiss the case. “Not who communicated with the individual, how the plaintiffs received information from that person, where that person worked … or what that person knows about the alleged ‘incursions’ into the plaintiffs’ electronic devices.”

Despite Rosenstein’s departure from the Justice Department last year, conservatives have had issues with the way the department has been managed under Attorney General William Barr. Those fault lines became more visible on Monday, when Barr said he didn’t expect Durham’s review to involve the charge that either President Barack Obama or former Vice President Joe Biden had acted criminally. Trump told reporters later in the day that he was “a little surprised by that statement.”

Attkisson said the department has a tendency to protect its own regardless of which president is in power. While she declined to criticize Barr specifically, she highlighted that the problem included former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who resigned in 2018 and is presently running for his old Senate seat in Alabama — without Trump’s support.

“Prior to becoming attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions told an acquaintance he was well aware of what had happened to me with the government computer intrusions, and that it was shameful,” Attkisson told Mediaite. “But when he became attorney general, the Justice Department continued using taxpayer funds to fight my case. Numerous members of Congress for years, including several of them recently, have asked the FBI and Justice Department for information about the case, under two presidents, multiple attorneys general and multiple FBI directors, but they continue to get stiff-armed.”

It will also be at least another month until the judiciary decides if new facts will be allowed to emerge. The court hearing the case suspended operations in March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and is not set to reopen until mid-to-late June.

Attkisson said it would be appropriate for Trump to weigh in on the matter and to direct his Justice Department to examine other Americans who may have been the subject of surveillance in recent years.

“Certainly he is entitled to give direction to his Justice Department, as all presidents do, and convey priorities,” she said. “It seems to me that there are dishonest actors who have tried to convince him that he is not entitled to do these things. I do think somebody at the Justice Department should review the forensic evidence proving the government source of the intrusions, if there were any doubt, offer an immediate apology, stop fighting the lawsuit, begin an honest investigation as to who was responsible and who else was spied on.”",fake

Vietnam shares a border with China, yet it has reported no deaths from COVID-19 and just 268 confirmed cases, when other Southeast Asian nations are reporting thousands.

Experts say experience dealing with prior pandemics, early implementation of aggressive social distancing policies, strong action from political leaders and the muscle of a one-party authoritarian state have helped Vietnam.

""They had political commitment early on at the highest level,"" says John MacArthur, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's country representative in neighboring Thailand. ""And that political commitment went from central level all the way down to the hamlet level.""

With experience gained from dealing with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 pandemics, Vietnam's government started organizing its response in January — as soon as reports began trickling in from Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise from the World Health Organization and the CDC for its transparency in dealing with the crisis.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the ""spring general offensive of 2020,"" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive, which many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.

Tens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.

Streets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities. As the economic toll of the lockdown becomes apparent, some entrepreneurs are stepping up to help. One has provided ""rice ATMs"" to dispense free rice to those who are out of work.

Some may still be skeptical of Vietnam's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The CDC's MacArthur is not.

""Our team up in Hanoi is working very, very closely with their Ministry of Health counterparts,"" he says. ""The communications I've had with my Vietnam team is that at this point in time, [they] don't have any indication that those numbers are false.""",real

Most eligible Americans have by now received their check, called economic impact payments, though some are still being mailed to those who did not provide direct deposit information to the IRS. The checks have provided something of a cushion to the tens of millions of people who are out of work or have had their hours reduced, though many critics and lawmakers said they did not go far enough. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a second round of direct payments is ""necessary"" for the survival of many Americans, and that they would help stimulate the economy. But those checks are not likely to hit bank accounts soon, if at all. Here's what you need to know.

Where does the legislation stand?

House Democrats introduced the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act, a new piece of coronavirus legislation, that, among other relief measures, includes a second round of stimulus payments of up to $1,200 per person. The bill was passed in the House on Friday, but it is unlikely to make it through the Republican-controlled Senate, at least in its current form, NBC News reports. ""What Nancy Pelosi is proposing will never pass the Senate,"" Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Tuesday.

How much would the checks be worth?

Under the legislation, individuals would receive another payment of up to $1,200 (or $2,400 for married couples), and $1,200 per dependent (up to three). The income eligibility thresholds would be the same as the first round of checks: Individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would receive $1,200. After that, the checks would completely phase out at $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for couples.

What about dependents?

Unlike the first round of checks, all dependents would be eligible for the additional credit, not just those under 17. And that credit is worth much more: $1,200, compared to $500 for the first round. Each household could receive a maximum of three dependent credits. The first round of stimulus checks excluded adult dependents, including many in college.

What else is different?

This legislation also does not require recipients have a Social Security number to be eligible, which means those who file taxes with a taxpayer identification number (TIN) could receive a check this time around. Those without an SSN were excluded from the first round of checks.

Each year, the Eurovision Song Contest unites 180 million viewers in more than 40 countries for an electric-falsetto night of glitter, glam and hard-rock hallelujah.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the contest for the first time in its 64-year history. But instead of leaving so many super fans dance-crying to the 1974 winner Waterloo (ABBA), the song contest has instead decided to air a live two-hour special, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, Saturday on public broadcasting channels in more than 40 countries. (The U.S. is not one of them, so anyone living in that country will have to watch on Eurovision's YouTube channel, where the show will be live-streamed.)

The show is hosted in the Netherlands, where the contest was supposed to be held this year at the Ahoy concert hall. (The venue has been converted into an emergency hospital for coronavirus patients). All 41 contestants will perform remotely, though this year fans won't be able to phone in their votes for the winner.

The pre-pandemic 2020 favorites included the nerd-disco gem Think About Things by Iceland's Dadi og Gagnamagnid; the bodice-ripper Cleopatra by Azerbaijan's Efendi; and the auto-tuned hallucination jig that is Uno by Russia's Little Big.

In the weeks leading up to the show, several Eurovision performers past and present participated in sweet, low-key home concerts. Fans who missed the signature pyrotechnic drama also turned to Eurovision.TV to look up the vampire-opera ""It's My Life"" by Romania's super-soprano Cesar (2013) or the Hellenic solid-gold dancing in My Number One by Greece's Helena Paparizou, the 2005 winner.

The Eurovision song contest began in 1956 to bring together a continent shattered by World War II. Seven countries competed that first year, and the winner, Refrain by Switzerland's Lys Assia, is about lost love and innocence. The contest grew to include more countries, including those not in Europe, like Israel.

In the early years, performers were often backed by live orchestras. They sang in their native language: Vivo Cantando (1969), Hallelujah (1979), Ein bisschen Frieden (1982). As newlyweds in Athens in the 1970s, my parents lived next-door to the 1976 contestant from Greece, folk singer Mariza Koch, who sang this beautiful song in Greek. When I moved to Greece more than a decade ago, I befriended the 1995 contestant from Cyprus, who sang this Eurovision cult classic, also in Greek.

These days, it's mainly the French and Italians crooning in their native tongues, with these award-winning exceptions.

The Eurovision Song Contest has also expanded far beyond Europe and now includes Australia, though it did lose Hungary this year.

Hungary's national public broadcasting association said it wanted to focus its resources on ""Hungarian pop singers"" though one report said pro government media called the contest a ""homosexual flotilla."" Hungary has never won the contest but came in fourth in 1994 with this ballad sung by Friderika Bayer.

Many fans observing social distancing cannot hold Eurovision parties at home this year. Some made up for it with online watch parties, which involved tuning in remotely to watch reruns of previous contests.

Taiwan has complained of increased Chinese military harassment since the coronavirus pandemic began, with fighter jets and naval vessels regularly approaching the island on drills China has described as routine.

China says Taiwan is its most sensitive and important territorial issue, and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a Chinese province under its control, making the Taiwan Strait a potential military flashpoint.

Li, in his state-of-the-nation work report at the start of the annual meeting of China’s parliament, said his country would “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking Taiwan independence”.

China will improve policies and measures to encourage exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait, and protect the well-being of Taiwan’s people, he added.

“We will encourage them to join us in opposing Taiwan independence and promoting China’s reunification,” Li said. “With these efforts, we can surely create a beautiful future for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.”

However, there was no mention of the word “peaceful” in front of “reunification”, departing from the standard expression Chinese leaders have used for at least four decades when addressing parliament and mentioning Taiwan.

Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.

A senior Taiwan official, however, told Reuters the absence of the word “peaceful” did not signal a fundamental change in China’s approach towards the island.

“They are still talking about the concept of peaceful unification, just in an indirect linguistic expression,” said the person who is familiar with Taiwan’s policy towards China, pointing to Li’s remarks on cross-Strait exchanges and economic integration.

“It’s neutral. We do not look at it that way.”

China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is a separatist bent on independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

Speaking in Taipei on Wednesday at the inauguration of her second term, Tsai said Taiwan could not accept becoming part of China under its “one country, two systems” offer of autonomy, and rejected China’s sovereignty claims.

China wants Taiwan to accept the “one country, two systems” model, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy and which Beijing uses to run the former British colony of Hong Kong.

However, all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.

Responding to Li’s speech, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said the Taiwanese people were resolutely opposed to the “one country, two systems” proposal as it “belittles Taiwan and damages the status quo in the Taiwan Strait”.

On Friday, China proposed new legislation for Hong Kong requiring it to quickly enact national security regulations, a move some see as contradicting the “one country, two systems” concept, and swiftly condemned by Taiwan.

The announcement on Friday came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright said there are no plans to distribute a vaccine on an equitable scale, and called the timeline of 12 to 18 months being presented ""an aggressive schedule.""

""A lot of optimism is swirling around a 12-to-18-month time frame if everything goes perfectly. We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday before House lawmakers. ""I think it's going to take longer than that to do so.""

Trump departs the White House for Camp David

Before he boarded Marine One bound for Camp David late this afternoon, President Trump briefly spoke to reporters and was asked whether the COVID-19 vaccine should be available for free.

""We're looking at that, actually. But we're making a lot of progress on vaccines,"" Trump said. ""But we'll be speaking to you very soon, and I think we're going to have a very good couple of meetings at Camp David.""

He said he would have ""some military"" discussions and ""some other than military"" talks over the weekend.

When the president visited Camp David for another getaway weekend two weeks ago, it was the first time he had left the White House since March 28. Since then, he's also visited the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Trump says truckers blaring horns outside White House during event honoring people connected to COVID-19 'are on our side'

As they did earlier, truckers protesting near the White House blared their horns during a second event in the Rose Garden this afternoon meant to honor people connected to COVID-19.

""Those are friendly truckers, they are on our side,"" Trump told the audience. ""It is almost a celebration, in a way.""

The horns were very loud and could be heard at all times while Trump and the honorees spoke.

The truckers have protested in Washington for nearly two weeks over fair pay and low freight rates during the pandemic -- not in favor of, or against, the president.

The afternoon event's honorees included a nurse from West Virginia who volunteered in New York, a property owner from Arkansas who waived rent for his tenants and a Girl Scout troop from Maryland that donated cookies to first responders.

One of the scouts kept her mask on when she took the podium to speak. Three in the troop stepped forward to accept certificates from an unmasked President Trump.

The White House said the event, similar to one held two weeks ago, was meant to highlight the ""hard work, heroism and hope that Americans from all walks of life have exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

New White House coronavirus task force members announced

Vice President Mike Pence's office announced the addition of five people to the White House coronavirus task force on Friday, as the group shifts its messaging to focus on safely reopening the country, even though the country's infection rate has yet to significantly drop.

The new members include: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia, Director of the National Institutes of Health Dr. Francis Collins, FDA Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Dr. Peter Marks and Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration Thomas Engels.

In a written statement, Pence said these new members ""will add expertise in the fields of vaccines and therapeutics as well as worker safety as the Task Force renews its focus on getting Americans back to work.""

The president and vice president are currently maintaining distance from each other after two White House staffers tested posted for coronavirus last week. Trump said Thursday of Pence: ""I miss him.""

Trump names leaders of 'Operation Warp Speed,' says vaccine could come before the end of the year

President Donald Trump delivered remarks on vaccine development Friday afternoon, proclaiming that ""Operation Warp Speed,"" his administration's initiative to fast-track a vaccine, is the country's biggest undertaking since the Manhattan Project.

""Nobody has seen anything like we are doing now within our country since the Second World War. It's objective is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we'd love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year,"" Trump said, adding that the military is ""totally involved.""

Touting his message of reopening, the ever-optimistic president also said ""vaccine or no vaccine"" the country is already coming back.

""I just want to make something clear. It's very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back, and we're starting the process. And in many cases, they don't have vaccines, and a virus or a flu comes, and you fight through it,"" Trump said.

""As of this morning, almost every state has taken steps to begin reopening, and the American people are doing an extraordinary job of continuing to take precautions while at the same time wanting to start, and they will be starting to resume their American way of life,"" he added.

Trump said in the afternoon remarks from the Rose Garden that the development of treatments, in addition to vaccines, will be fast-tracked and made available ""quickly,"" and ""maybe before"" the end of the year.

He also formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui will lead the country's vaccine development with Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command, working alongside him.

Trump said vaccines will be made ""right here in the U.S.A."" but that he will help other countries in every way possible.

""We have no ego when it comes to this, no ego whatsoever,"" the president said.

His call to also ""ramp up production of supplies needed for distribution, such as cold chain storage, glass vials, needles, syringes, and more,"" came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright told lawmakers the federal government has faced depletions of N95 masks, swabs and other essential equipment since January.

Since Bright said his concerns were ignored by officials including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Azar has stayed by the president's side, and even joined him Thursday to criticize his former employee.

""Our vision for Operation Warp Speed -- setting a goal of a vaccine by January 2021 -- will be one of the great scientific and humanitarian accomplishments in human history,"" Azar said Friday, standing next to the president.

""Dr. Slaoui is arguably the world's most experienced and successful vaccine developer, responsible for some of the major recent breakthroughs in vaccines. General Perna oversees one of the world's largest logistics and supply chain operations, the one that keeps the army running,"" he continued.

Trump was later asked to follow up on what he meant when he said the country is back, ""vaccine on no vaccine.""

""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do, we're gonna really be a big step ahead. And if we don't, we're gonna be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point,"" Trump said. ""But if it does flare up, we're gonna put out the fire and will put it out quickly and efficiently.""

In an interview with Fox Business aired Thursday, President Trump said he plans to mobilize the U.S. military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available, focusing first on older Americans who are among the most at risk.

""I just literally left a meeting. We're are mobilizing our military -- and other forces, but we are mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine,"" he said. ""Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.""

FDA commissioner says it's up to White House if they'll still use Abbott ID NOW test after accuracy concerns

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Steven Hahn said on ""CBS"" Friday morning ""that will be a White House decision"" as to whether they still use the Abbott ID NOW test in light of an FDA notice ""alerting the public to early data that suggest potential inaccurate results.""

""Specifically, the test may return false negative results,"" the agency said in a statement Thursday night.

When asked if he'd continue to recommend the White House use it, Hahn said he would provide guidance.

""We're providing guidance to the White house regarding this test,"" Hahn said from his self-quarantine, which he's undergoing after he came into contact with a person who tested positive. ""We have been on an ongoing basis. And we will continue to do that. That will be a White House decision.""

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn is seen in a frame grab from a video feed as he testifies remotely during a U.S. Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Washington, May 12, 2020. via Reuters

Hahn noted that the FDA continues ""to recommend its use or to have it available for use"" and that, in light of the notice his agency sent, ""it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about.""

He also said the FDA is continuing to investigate the issue but that others haven't reported the same problems.

""There are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test,"" he said. ""However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem.""

Sputnik spoke about Amazon's success with Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of Economics at Boston University.

Sputnik: According to reports, Jeff Bezos is set to be the world's first trillionaire. In your view, what are the main reasons that Amazon has been able to maintain its position on the market amid the pandemic?

Laurence Kotlikoff: The worry that people have about in-store shopping is the main reason. So it's very good news for Amazon, but really terrible days for retail outlets.

They are blocked in Boston and in Moscow, you're gonna find everything shut down. It's a ghost town. And every city in the US, with some exceptions in states that have decided to ignore the danger or the risk, they may find that they made a big mistake.

There are some countries that are able to continue maintaining retail outlets as they did before. But for the most part, we've got France, Italy, US, UK shut down. So the only way it can get the products is... over the internet from Amazon because I couldn't go down and try it out in IKEA as the store's been closed.

I do think that there's a question here whether these companies like Amazon need to be nationalised, to tell you the truth because it's a public marketplace.

The marketplace needs to be organised by governments. Some shops are not operating in a lot of countries on Sunday or Saturday, the weekends, because it's a day of rest for the workers. You don't want to have some people go to some stores if they are closed on Saturday and others are open.

It doesn't make sense. You want to coordinate. So if I go to the butcher shop, I can also walk across the street, go to the shoe store on the same day at the same hour. Otherwise, you don't get the same level of economic activity. So I think Amazon needs to be nationalised. And also the concentration of wealth going to one person or a set of people is not healthy for any country.

Sputnik: But what is the key element of Amazon’s success in comparison to any other company in this field?

Laurence Kotlikoff: What is their big advantage? They got in first. What is the big advantage of Facebook? They got in there first. It was random.

What about, a lot of companies that have been successful. We're just like a step ahead of the competition. But it's like a market where only one player can play. It makes sense to have one place as people don't want to go online to 20 different websites to see if they can find out what they can buy.

Sputnik: What impact can Amazon's success have on other competing firms on the US market?

Laurence Kotlikoff: Well, they can do what it has been doing. Same with realy big stores like Walmart. You can put small retailers out of business. Such stores as Walmart, Costco and IKEA are big box stores that are exploiting their natural monopolies.

So if you have a lot of small stores in a nice little town in the countryside and then maybe a Walmart... all the small stores in this little town suffer dramatically, and then the town is basically boarded up.

We have to think about, what kind of a society we want to have? People just buying from one company on the internet, buying from a couple of huge stores and having no community life, no towns, everybody just living inside their apartments or homes?

Is that the vision of our national urban planning that we're striving for or are we trying to maintain our way of life? Think about Europe. If you are in France or England, there are a few box stores, but they're pretty remote compared to what we have in the US.

It's a public good for everybody. Everybody can go out to the countryside and enjoy it. But then they (box stores) arrived in the Cotswolds, in the U.K. or the countryside of France.

In the US, you have to drive from the East Coast about a third way across the country to have that experience. I mean, there are places you can go in remote parts of New York state. We have a sprawling suburban system here.

We have decided that anybody can put up any kind of house, any kind of business on any road in any part of the country.

Sputnik: In your view, what can be done by the government and local authorities to help other companies keep afloat during this crisis?

Laurence Kotlikoff: During this crisis, we need to explain something to you that is a little different from the standard answer you might be expecting, which is we need to find a way to capture or kill this virus. And there is a method for doing that, which is very straightforward. Suppose you had the ability to give everybody a test every single day so if they were negative, you could give them a rating bracelet to wear during the day, and they could go back to work, school, go to movies, shop. And if they were red, if they were testing positive, they'd have to stay inside until they tested green again and then they could go out.

That would immediately mean that everybody on the outside would be safe to interact with. Everybody on the inside would be trying to survive this thing, getting health care and free fruit right now. That's an example of containing and killing the virus. Within a few weeks, we would have no virus problem.

It would have been killed off. The people with the virus would have either survived or passed away, unfortunately. And the people outside would be virus-free. Now, there are issues of false negatives in the testing, but this protocol would work even under those conditions because you have it retesting people every day, so you'll catch the false negatives, any kinds of mistakes. Statistically, the transmission rate will go to zero very, very quickly. We do not have the ability to test everybody every day. That's 7.6 billion tests a day around the world. But we have something that's almost as effective, basic as effective, which is called group testing, where you take 60 households and you pull together, you have them spit into the same cup - that's a household sample.

And then you add a reagent to that and then you take each cup, each household sample from 60 different households and you mix all that together. And now you have one batch sample, one called a sample, one group sample and you test that.

And if it's negative now, you can give a green bracelet to probably another 50 people in that household.

You've used one test to clear one hundred and fifty people. That's an enormous deficiency. A hundred and fifty to one efficiency. So we could do a group household testing in our country with six million tests, which we can get to within a couple weeks.

We could solve this problem in a month if we use them with intelligence and organized, and make it voluntary. So this is really not that hard.

Clearly, there's other ways to try and fight this: social distancing and masking... but we're not compliant.",fake

Roughly 3,000 sailors who had been removed from the ship have returned, and for them to do so, they had to have two negative tests.

In addition to the five sailors who were removed after testing positive, another 18 sailors were also taken off the ship because they had been in close contact.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Five US Navy sailors who were cleared to return to the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt after two negative tests have tested positive for COVID-19, a defense official told Insider Thursday.

All five of the sailors have been removed from the ship, as have 18 other sailors who were in close contact with them.

The sailors, a defense official explained, had previously tested positive for the virus and were removed from the ship and placed in isolation on Guam. All five sailors completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine and tested negative twice before they were allowed to return to the ship.

The outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt began in late March with only a few cases. As of April 30, there were 1,102 cases among sailors assigned to the ship.

The virus upended the carrier's Pacific deployment, forcing it into port in Guam, where it has remained for over a month as the Navy works to get the situation under control.

Over 80% of the carrier's crew of roughly 4,800 sailors were evacuated ashore and placed in isolation in hotels and other facilities.

In recent weeks, sailors have begun returning to the ship, but only on the condition that they meet the health requirements.

""You have to go through two different checks plus being COVID tested twice,"" Capt. Carlos Sardiello, commanding officer of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, told CBS News earlier this month. ""We sideline sailors for the slightest thing. Sniffles.""

But there are some challenges.

The New York Times reported Thursday that one sailor hid a loss of smell, a key symptom of COVID-19, from medical examiners for days after returning to the ship.

In response, a sailor in the medical department sent out a message begging crewmembers to be honest. ""Please stress the importance of being truthful so we don't potentially have Covid+ aboard this ship,"" the email reportedly read.

The latest development in the USS Theodore Roosevelt saga comes as roughly 3,000 sailors have returned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt and is an indication that the fight for a healthy ship is yet to be won.",real
1942,1480,https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-slashes-emissions-for-now/,2020-05-19,Coronavirus slashes emissions (for now),"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real
1948,103,https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186653/coronavirus-covid-19-air-pollution-vulnerable-lung-disease-pandemic,2020-03-19,Air pollution could make the COVID-19 pandemic worse for some people,"Juliana Pino usually fights to push polluters out of the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, an industrial area with a big Latino community. Now, amid the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, she and her colleagues are also checking in on their elderly neighbors, pooling money together for groceries to help those who can’t afford them, and translating health information on the novel coronavirus for Spanish-speaking residents. The work is different, but it’s still connected to her fight for clean air.

The older people who live in Little Village are already more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age. But the ones who grew up here also spent most of their lives breathing in air laden with the soot from nearby coal power plants, she explains. “You have a legacy of toxic exposure paired with a lot of social vulnerability, that means that the same pound of pollution impacts different people differently,” says Pino, a policy director for the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, which successfully campaigned to close the coal power plants in 2012.

“Inequities have real consequences and COVID-19 will show that.”

The novel coronavirus is changing nearly every aspect of life in places with an outbreak. Like any disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic will hit some people harder than others. Since it’s a disease that affects the lungs, people who live in places with way more air pollution could be more vulnerable. This pollution tends to be worse in communities with more poverty, people of color, and immigrants.

When it comes to the US, “We’re the richest country in the world yet we have some of the greatest inequities. These inequities have real consequences and COVID-19 will show that,” John Balmes, a physician and a spokesperson for the American Lung Association, tells The Verge. “The air pollution interacts with multiple other factors that increase risk,” he says.

4. It is directly related to our fight for clean air, clean water, a healthy environment, and healthy communities.#COVID19 is affecting all of us—our health and our way of life, but low-income communities and communities of color may face added risk. — Gina McCarthy (@GinaNRDC) March 16, 2020

Severe cases of COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia, which can kill. The disease is deadliest in older people and those with preexisting health conditions that make it harder to breathe or fight off the infection. Even without a pandemic, living with air pollution has been linked to higher rates of lung disease like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in populations. High levels of air pollution have also been linked to larger numbers of people hospitalized with pneumonia, studies in the US and China have found.

During the 2003 SARS outbreaks, which was caused by another coronavirus, patients from places with the highest levels of air pollution were twice as likely to die from SARS compared to those who lived in places with little pollution, a study on SARS cases in China found. Even moderately bad air pollution significantly increased the risk of death.

There isn’t data yet on how air pollution is playing into the current pandemic, but Balmes points out that international hotspots for COVID-19 — Wuhan, Northern Italy, and South Korea — have pretty high levels of air pollution. He believes air pollution may be one reason, although not the primary factor, for why outbreaks in those places have been so devastating.

Another data point from China backs up the air pollution hypothesis. More men have died from the novel coronavirus in China than women, and there’s been some speculation that this could be because fewer women there smoke. If smoking does put someone at higher risk, then the same is probably true of air pollution, Ana Navas-Acien, a physician-epidemiologist at Columbia University, tells The Verge. “If we extrapolate from there, we could speculate that maybe individuals, communities that have higher air pollution levels could also be at higher risk of developing a more severe infection,” she says. “It’s a hypothesis at least worth testing.”

In places like Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood, the COVID-19 pandemic is piling on top of other stressors. Social distancing immediately took its toll on the city’s street vendors, a majority of whom live in the neighborhood, according to Pino. “It’s like today, right now, they can’t afford the groceries because they would have taken that day’s cash to go get supplies,” says Pino. “It’s those folks in really precarious day-to-day situations that the community’s rallying around — even still, it’s not enough,” she says.

higher risks and fewer resources

Air pollution was already a problem in the area and so was making ends meet. That’s a double whammy of higher risk and fewer resources. “Researchers call this the double jeopardy hypothesis and it can be extended to something like the novel coronavirus pandemic we are now facing,” Anjum Hajat, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, said in an email to The Verge. That “double jeopardy” is often used to describe disadvantages that elderly people of color face because of both their age and race.

Balmes also worries about how poor housing and not enough green space or healthy foods in polluted neighborhoods increase risks. Some immigrants may have an even harder time getting care because of the fear of deportation, he fears.

Fewer cars on the road and planes in the air have temporarily curbed pollution in China, Italy, and California. But it doesn’t erase the decades’ worth of damage that’s been done. That’s why, Pino says, “we need to see targeted, prioritized help to the communities that are being hit hard now.”",real

1961,1504,https://news.yahoo.com/cdc-coronavirus-mainly-spreads-through-persontoperson-contact-and-does-not-spread-easily-on-contaminated-surfaces-153317029.html,2020-05-19,CDC: Coronavirus mainly spreads through person-to-person contact and 'does not spread easily' on contaminated surfaces,"The CDC has updated guidelines on coronavirus' spread, saying that it's ""not likely"" to spread through surfaces.

Even before COVID-19 officially had a name, public health officials said the virus could be transmitted through infected respiratory droplets and by touching infected surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, and possibly your eyes. So, people began snatching up face masks, wearing gloves, and ramping up hand hygiene to try to protect themselves.

While touching infected surfaces has always been part of the messaging on how the virus spreads, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently shifted its stance online. The CDC now says that COVID-19 spreads from person to person contact, and then lists touching infected surfaces under a section titled, ""The virus does not spread easily in other ways."" The CDC adds: “This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.” The language is a subtle change from the organization’s warning in early March, when it wrote simply that it “may be possible” to spread the virus through contaminated surfaces.

The CDC, which did not respond to Yahoo Life’s request for comment, still recommends that you wash your hands often with soap and water, and routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces to protect yourself and others from the virus.

The CDC’s lesser emphasis on infected surfaces as part of the spread of COVID-19 is slightly different from that of the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO states online that “COVID-19 spreads primarily from person to person,” but adds that, “it can also spread if you touch contaminated objects and surfaces.” The WHO even breaks down for readers all of the commonly-touched surfaces to be wary of, like doorknobs, computers, elevator buttons, and pens, noting that “If you touch something contaminated and then touch your face… you might fall ill.”

So what does this mean, exactly?

Dr. Richard Watkins, an infectious disease physician in Akron, Ohio, and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University, tells Yahoo Life that it’s important to keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new virus. “We are still learning about this new coronavirus —including how it spreads — and knowledge is increasing daily,” he says. With that, some guidance and information on the virus may change over time, he says.

There has been no new, major study to suggest that contaminated surfaces are less important in the spread of COVID-19, but epidemiological data (which is the method used to find the causes of health outcomes and diseases in populations) has simply found that person-to-person contact is more important, infectious disease expert Dr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Yahoo Life.

“Based on the epidemiology, we know that the main way this virus is infecting people is from direct contact with other infected people,” Adalja says. “Contaminated surfaces play some role, but it’s likely much smaller.” It also makes sense, too, he says: “This is a respiratory virus, and respiratory viruses largely spread through breathing in infected respiratory droplets.”

Concerns about contracting the virus from infected surfaces mostly stemmed from a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in mid-March. That study found that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can last on a variety of surfaces for anywhere from four hours (copper) to three days (plastic and stainless steel). What the study didn’t find was whether people could actually become infected from touching those surfaces. But, since the study’s release, people have been nervous about handling mail, groceries, and other high-touch surfaces like doorknobs.

But the CDC’s shift in guidance doesn’t mean you should stop being cautious with those things, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “If I had to pick the things to pick an emphasis on to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it would still be social distancing, wearing masks, and practicing good hand hygiene,” he says. Schaffner compares the spread of COVID-19 to roadways. “Person-to-person contact is a highway, and the inanimate environment is a byway. Touching infected surfaces are little paths, but they don’t carry the big viral traffic,” he says.",real

Depends on which country you are flying in,"SYDNEY/BEIJING/HELSINKI (Reuters) - In Thailand, you cannot have food or water in flight and must wear a mask. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the plane needs to be half-empty. In the United States and Europe, it’s not mandatory for airlines to leave the middle seat open.

FILE PHOTO - Rows of empty seats of an American Airline flight are seen, as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disruption continues across the global industry, during a flight between Washington D.C. and Miami, in Washington, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria

Measures to stem the spread of coronavirus have changed how people travel, as Beijing resident Feng Xueli, 26, found when she took a domestic flight this month. The aircraft was full - allowed under the Chinese rules.

“We needed to wear a mask during the flight and there were PA announcements basically asking for our cooperation with these anti-virus measures put in place, which made me a bit nervous,” Feng said. “You also need to go through a lot of temperature checks and security checks when you leave the airport.”

Travellers, airlines and airports are grappling with a hodgepodge of rules put in place during the pandemic that will make flying different in almost every country.

“When flying restarts, you are already working against the clock. There is still a latent fear of travel,” said Subhas Menon, head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “It’s not going to be such a smooth passage when you travel because of all of the measures that are going to be introduced.”

A little more than a year after uneven national responses to the grounding of the Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX, the industry is once again facing piecemeal regulation.

The last trigger for such widespread changes in the way airlines operate was the 2001 attacks in the United States, which ushered in new security measures.

“People globally have understood the security requirements that came after 9/11. We would like to see that kind of standardisation of protocols,” said Boeing vice-president Mike Delaney, leader of Boeing’s Confident Travel Initiative.

Onboard service is changing too. Business-class meals, once a selling point for premium carriers hiring celebrity chefs, have been reduced to pre-packaged items on carriers including Emirates, Air Canada (AC.TO) and British Airways.

Automation is also increasing, as carriers such as Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) ask passengers to check in online to limit contact with staff and other fliers.

“More than ever, the industry will work towards the vision of an entirely mobile-enabled journey,” said Sumesh Patel of technology provider SITA, which hopes to benefit from the trend.

EMPTY MIDDLE SEAT?

On the airplane, one of the biggest debates has been over whether middle seats should be empty.

That would limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, not enough for most airlines to make a profit without increasing fares.

Afif Zakwan, 20, recently took a Malaysia Airlines domestic flight that was exempt from the requirement to fly half-empty.

He said he was comfortable being on a full domestic flight, but would not consider flying internationally for now.

“As more and more people travel for whatever reason, confidence and the power of word of mouth experiences will shape the... recovery,” said Mayur Patel of data firm OAG Aviation.

An official at the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau said the issue of an open middle seat, which could create unfair advantages if applied unevenly, was “controversial”.

“It’s crucial that countries where flights depart coordinate their responses with countries where they arrive,” said the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly.

Despite the call for common standards, some nations are applying their rules just to airlines registered in their country, while others are applying them to foreign carriers.

U.S. carriers are among those requiring passengers and crew to wear facial coverings, and have also endorsed temperature checks.

In Europe, airlines are largely resisting calls to leave the middle seat empty but have publicised other changes designed to reassure passengers.

“You have to remember an aircraft is not the natural place to do social-distancing, so you need to mitigate the health risks by other means, and facial masks are a good example of those means,” Finnair Plc (FIA1S.HE) Chief Executive Topi Manner told Reuters.",real

Over 4.9 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.

Since the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 1.5 million diagnosed cases and at least 92,645 deaths.

""Right now, in the midst of a global pandemic and crisis, we should take it as our civic duty to drive safely,"" Martin said. ""If we won't do it for ourselves, we should do it for our first responders, our law enforcement and our healthcare workers, who are rightly focused on coronavirus patients and should not be overwhelmed by preventable car crashes.""

10:35 a.m.: NYC offering testing to all of its 169 nursing homes

New York City is expanding testing to reach residents at all of the city's 169 nursing homes, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.

Seniors are especially vulnerable to the virus and U.S. nursing homes have experienced outbreaks.

The city is expected to run 3,000 tests per day through a city-contracted lab, he said.

Mandatory staff testing has begun, the mayor said, and any staff member who tests positive will be required to stay out of work for 14 days. New York City's surge staffing has already added 240 personnel and will fulfill all staffing requests by the end of next week, de Blasio said.

De Blasio said 10 outbreak response teams are ready to jump into action if an outbreak hits a nursing home or senior center. Each team has an epidemiologist and experts in infection control, mental health and social work, he said.

Over a six-week period in 2019, almost 400,000 doses were administered in the city, compared to fewer than 150,000 doses over the same six weeks in 2020, he said.

""Something has to be done immediately,"" the mayor stressed, calling vaccinations ""essential work"" and ""a reason to leave your home.""

Vaccines are being offered for free at over 1,000 facilities in the city. The mayor urged parents to call their pediatrician to make an appointment.

When it came to New York City's three tracking progress indicators, de Blasio called it ""not perfect, but a good day.""

9:19 a.m.: Wuhan nearly doubles number of COVID-19 tests per day

The Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, conducted 856,128 nucleic acid tests on Tuesday, nearly doubling the previous day, according to the local health authority.

No confirmed cases of COVID-19 with symptoms were found during Tuesday's testing period; however, 13 new asymptomatic carriers were identified, according to daily reports published by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

Last week, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced a citywide campaign to test the entire population of 11 million residents for COVID-19 in an effort to search for asymptomatic carriers of the virus, after a cluster of new cases emerged for the first time since the city had lifted its strict lockdown on April 8. The number of nucleic acid tests conducted in the city daily has rapidly increased since then.

Although recommended, participation in the testing campaign is voluntary. Residents who were previously tested do not need to take part. It is not recommended to test children under the age of 6, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's website.

8:29 a.m.: Students start returning to classrooms across South Korea

South Korean schools began welcoming back students on Wednesday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Hundreds of thousands of high school seniors in South Korea were allowed to return to their schools Wednesday morning, while students in lower grades are expected to go back in phased steps in the coming weeks. Both students and teachers much have their temperatures taken before entering schools and wear face masks in classrooms.

Some 5.4 million students in South Korea have been taking classes online prior to Wednesday's reopening of schools.

South Korea once had the largest novel coronavirus outbreak outside China, where the virus first emerged, but appears to have brought it under control with an extensive ""trace, test and treat"" strategy. A total of 11,110 people in the country have been diagnosed with COVID-19, of which 10,066 have recovered and 263 have died, according to South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After relaxing its social-distancing restrictions earlier this month, South Korea saw a small yet sharp spike in new infections linked to reopened nightclubs in the capital, Seoul.

7:43 a.m.: Dutch officials say mink may have infected human with COVID-19

Dutch investigators believe a human may have contracted the novel coronavirus from a mink at a farm in the Netherlands.

New research findings in the ongoing investigation into the country's mink farms also show that the animals can have COVID-19 without showing any symptoms, according to a press release from the Dutch government.

Investigators also believe cats may have a role in the spread of the virus on the mink farms. Coronavirus antibodies were detected in three out of 11 cats at one of the mink farms under investigation. Pending further research, the Dutch government is advising mink farm owners to ensure that cats cannot enter or exit the site.

The government is now instituting mandatory antibody testing of minks at all farms in the Netherlands. The European country is one of the world's largest producers of mink fur.

""These new findings have a major impact on mink farm owners and staff and their families, as well as on local communities,"" Dutch Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten said in a statement late Tuesday night. ""I'm in close contact with all those involved.""

7:08 a.m.: Russia surpasses 300,000 total cases of COVID-19

Russia on Wednesday reported 8,764 new cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 308,705, according to the country's coronavirus response headquarters.

There were also a record 135 coronavirus-linked fatalities registered over the same period -- the country's highest single-day increase so far -- which places the nationwide death toll at 2,972. The previous record was 119 deaths reported on May 16.

For the first time on Wednesday, Russia's coronavirus response headquarters reported more patients recovering from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours -- 9,262 -- than the number of people testing positive.

Russia has one of the world's highest nationwide tallies of diagnosed cases in the coronavirus pandemic, second only to the United States, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Russia's latest daily caseload is down from a peak of 11,656 new infections reported on May 11. Last Thursday marked the end of a 12-day streak during which the country registered over 10,000 new cases per day.

6:24 a.m.: UN chief warns coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress

The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress, although the vast continent seems to be relatively spared from the scourge of the virus so far.

There have been less than 3,000 deaths from COVID-19 out of some 88,000 cases of the disease reported throughout Africa. That could be, in part, due to the fact that many countries across the continent took swift action in imposing preventative measures to stem the spread of the virus.

""As of now, reported cases are lower than feared,"" Guterres said in a video message Wednesday, while warning that ""much hangs in the balance"" and the pandemic ""will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.""

The U.N. chief called for ""international action to strengthen Africa's health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings."" He said the continent needs more than $200 billion and ""an across-the-board debt standstill for African countries"" to help address the devastating economic and social fallout of the crisis.

""Already, demand for Africa's commodities, tourism and remittances are declining,"" Guterres said, adding that ""the opening of the trade zone has been pushed back.""

It's the first globally-known university to announce such plans beyond the upcoming fall term.

""Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements,"" the spokesperson added. ""This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.""

The University of Cambridge, one of the oldest universities in the world, closed its campuses in the United Kingdom in March due to the pandemic. All teaching has been moved online and exams are conducted virtually.

4:19 a.m.: All 50 US states have now eased coronavirus restrictions

All 50 U.S. states have now taken steps to ease restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Connecticut was among the last to begin reopening its society and economy, with residents allowed to go to retail shops and dine outdoors at restaurants starting Wednesday. Hair salons and barbershops, however, won't be allowed to reopen until June 1, while guidance on gyms, nail salons, massage therapy businesses and tattoo parlors will come at a later date.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont called it a ""slow and methodical reopening.""

""There is a balance and there's nothing that is risk-free,"" Lamont said at a virtual press conference Tuesday. ""I think we can proceed on a very thoughtful basis with those businesses that are least likely to be dangerous and most likely to have a real economic value for the state. And I'm looking forward, I think this is a good day for the state and I hope everybody maintains their discipline because that's going to make it successful.""

The process hasn't been without controversy. Earlier this month, protesters gathered outside the Connecticut state capital and the governor's mansion in Hartford demanding that businesses be allowed to resume activities, as a growing number of other states across the country began reopening.

Connecticut, home to some 3.5 million people, has so far tested more than 185,000 people for COVID-19 and at least 38,430 have returned positive results.

At least 3,472 people in the state have died from the disease, while another 914 remained hospitalized Tuesday.

""These are trend lines that I think give us some confidence,"" Lamont said. ""The timing is right, and we hit the key metrics that we thought we would.""

1973,1530,https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-leaked-pentagon-memo-warns-153609555.html,2020-05-20,"Coronavirus: Leaked Pentagon memo warns pandemic could last until summer 2021, including likely second wave, reports say","Defense Secretary Mark Esper pictured with White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci: AP Photo/Alex Brandon

A leaked Pentagon draft memo says that the US should expect for the coronavirus pandemic to last until the summer of 2021, according to those that have seen it.

The Department of Defence document, obtained by Task & Purpose, advises the that the military prepare for a “globally-persistent” Covid-19 environment with no effective vaccine until “at least the summer of 2021.

Authored by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, though not finalised or signed by him, the memo warns against any complacency that the virus will now be easily defeated: “We have a long path ahead, with the real possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19.”

It continues: “Therefore we must now refocus our attention on resuming critical missions, increasing levels of activity, and making necessary preparations should a significant resurgence of Covid-19 occur later this year.”

These preparations are likely to include the repositioning of forces and supplies in a faster-paced summer move cycle in which personnel are redeployed domestically and internationally.

Task & Purpose reports that the memo was prepared by Kenneth Rapuano, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence and global security. It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.

A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.

Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.

“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”

As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.

As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”

A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.

1979,1750,http://sputniknews.com/europe/202005221079385563-george-soros-says-coronavirus-could-kill-the-eu/,2020-05-22,George Soros Says Coronavirus Could Kill the EU,"The financier’s comments come just a week after he voiced fears that the German Constitutional Court’s recent ruling on the European Central Bank’s haphazard purchasing of government debt may spell “the end of the EU as we know it.”

Billionaire investor George Soros has reiterated his recent warning about the European Union’s possible fate, warning that the bloc could die from the economic calamity brought on by the coronavirus crisis unless it began issuing bonds to assist its weakest members.

“If the EU is unable to consider it now, it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts,” Soros said in an email to reporters, his remarks cited by Reuters. “This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality,” he stressed.

According to the investor, issuing bonds to help countries would require Brussels to maintain a AAA credit rating, meaning the need to authorize new taxes to cover the bonds’ cost. “The taxes only have to be authorized; they don’t need to be implemented,” he insisted.

Soros also expanded on a subject he discussed at length last week – the German Constitutional Court’s ruling that the European Central Bank had overstepped its mandate with the purchase of government debt under its quantitative easing (i.e. cash printing) programme. The German court gave the bank a three-month ultimatum to justify the proportionality of the bond purchases, and warned that the Bundesbank would drop out of the programme if a solution was not found. In an unprecedented response, the European Commission threatened to sue Berlin.

In his remarks Friday, Soros suggested that “the relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19.”

According to Soros, if Italy drops out of the EU, it might be the beginning of the end for the bloc. “What would be left of Europe without Italy?” he asked.

Soros isn’t alone in his concerns about the EU’s weak performance in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Brussels’ failure to “mount a joint fiscal defence” against the coronavirus and the “lack of a cohesive fiscal policy” have already made the euro one of the weakest major Western currencies, sparking fresh fears about the bloc’s future.

Soros, the Hungarian-American hedge fund manager-turned activist, has been a vocal proponent of the European Union project since the 1990s. In the UK, he’s best known for sparking the 1992 run on the pound, which earned him his first billion dollar earning, but cost the British economy billions in losses. In 2002, he was convicted of insider trading in France. Elsewhere, he’s faced criticism for spending billions of dollars spreading his vision of a global, liberal, market-driven world order. He began his political activities in Eastern Europe in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, his Open Societies Foundations have spread to over 60 countries, including not just developing nations, but the US and Western Europe as well. Russia kicked Open Society Foundations out of the country in 2015, listing their activities as a threat to national security.",fake
1993,680,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/5/7/21250849/clorox-wipes-local-stores-stocked-by-summer-with-disinfecting-cleaners,2020-05-07,"Clorox wipes should be fully back in stock by summer, company CEO says","Clorox says retail shelves will not be fully stocked with its popular wipes and other disinfectant cleaners used to combat COVID-19 until this summer.

“We think that there’s going to be substantial improvement this summer,” Clorox chairman and CEO Benno Dorer told Yahoo Finance in an interview. “It’s going to be touch and go until then, unfortunately.”

Shoppers have become increasingly frustrated as they scour the internet and local stores for Lysol sprays and Clorox wipes, only to find shelves picked clean after households stocked up on cleaning products to protect against infection, especially in COVID-19 hot zones.

Manufacturers like Clorox were not prepared for skyrocketing demand in a sleepy sector with reliably steady sales that usually fluctuate only during flu season.

On a third-quarter earnings call last week, Dorer told analysts that Clorox saw demand for disinfectant products increase more than 500%.

“Demand has been clearly unprecedented, and we’re in uncharted territory for our supply chain, in particular, in disinfecting products,” he said.

Products such as Clorox 4-in-1 Disinfecting Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Spray are among the products that the Environmental Protection Agency says likely protect against the spread of the coronavirus.

Disinfectant manufacturers have cranked up production, narrowed the number of products they make and have invested in increased capacity to try to catch up with skyrocketing demand.

“To try and meet demand to the greatest extent possible, we’ve been running our cleaning and disinfecting product plants 24/7,” Dorer told analysts last week. “To increase output, we’ve accessed third-party supply sources focused on manufacturing of disinfecting products and those that can be supplied most quickly, and we’ve been partnering with suppliers and retailers to get product where it is needed the most.”

Tom Derry, CEO of the Institute for Supply Management, told USA TODAY last month that shoppers would not be able to easily buy disinfectant wipes and other cleaning products again until June. But he predicted intermittent shortages could persist for months.

Last week, Clorox reported that third-quarter sales rose 15%, buoyed by purchases of bleach, wipes and other cleaning products. The company’s cleaning segment, which includes disinfectant wipes, bleach and Pine-Sol, saw sales growth of 32%, the company reported.

For many people, starting a company in the midst of a global economic crisis is the last thing on their lockdown to-do list. But it might not be such a crazy idea. According to entrepreneurs and start-up investors CNBC spoke with, now might even be the best time to start thinking about setting up a new venture from home. The coronavirus pandemic is in many ways serving as a ""catalyst to creation,"" Index Ventures Partner Jan Hammer told CNBC. He thinks history may be on the side of entrepreneurs building their businesses at a time of adversity. ""If history gives us a good precedent, out of the last crisis — which was the great financial crisis of 2008 to 2010 — a cohort of extremely resilient businesses have emerged,"" Hammer said in an interview. He cited examples such as food delivery firm Just Eat, payments company Adyen and money transfer start-up TransferWise, which were all founded in 2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively. ""These were ideas born in, you could argue, difficult times,"" Hammer added. ""And in a way, the trends that had driven the growth of these businesses were unrelated to the macroeconomic cycle.""

There are plenty of businesses which were founded during or around the time of economic crises. General Motors, IBM and HP are some of the biggest names that were born out of downturns, such as the panic of 1907 and the Great Depression. Meanwhile, many tech start-ups, such as Groupon, Uber and Pinterest, were established during or shortly after the Great Recession.

Building new ventures

Lara Vandenberg launched Publicist, an online marketplace for businesses to find freelancers in PR and communications, on Tuesday. Usually New York-based, Vandenberg temporarily moved back to her native Australia as the coronavirus hit the U.S., but pressed on regardless of the time difference. Around 35% of the U.S. workforce — or 57 million people — are freelance, according to a report by jobs website Upwork, and the pandemic has accelerated a move to project-based work, Vandenberg said. Publicist is about to close a funding round after bootstrapping the beta site, though isn't disclosing how much it has raised. It will charge hirers 20% commission per project. ""Although we are launching a company at this really volatile point in this macro economy, the future of work is an area people are really excited about,"" Vandenberg told CNBC. ""And in parallel, it's just an exciting problem to solve.""

For Chris Howard, co-founder at venture fund Fuel Capital, now is a good time to promote a new company because ad space is cheaper. ""You have an increase in the amount of time that users are spending online,"" he told CNBC. ""You can get a better understanding of cost per new customer that you're adding … then you can begin retention marketing campaigns.""

Saying goodbye to 'bulls--t jobs'

Matt Clifford heads up Entrepreneur First, a so-called ""talent investor"" out of London that helps founders network with each other and develop their business ideas. ""We're not seeing a reduction in applications, which is really interesting — and I'll be honest, I thought we would,"" Clifford told CNBC. "" I can totally identify with the mindset where you say now is not the time to quit a job."" ""It's also a time where a lot of things look pretty trivial,"" he added. ""There's this whole thing about 'bulls--t jobs' that's sort of been going around for about a decade now."" By ""bulls--t jobs,"" Clifford is referring to roles that workers feel don't have a meaningful impact on society. It's a concept that was explored in a book by American anthropologist David Graeber in 2018.",real
2000,771,https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21255084/quibi-jeffrey-katzenberg-streaming-tv-screenshot-sharing-social-media-subscribers-coronavirus,2020-05-11,Quibi will add sharing features as the app struggles to find subscribers,"To say that Quibi is off to a disastrous start would be an understatement. Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg attributes “everything that has gone wrong to coronavirus,” he told The New York Times in a new interview published on Monday. But Katzenberg is hopeful that rolling out new features will help, including giving subscribers the ability to share content from Quibi shows on social media.

When Quibi launched at the beginning of April, the app blocked sharing to platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit. Now, Katzenberg and the team are working on ways to ensure Quibi is “less walled off from the internet.” People will eventually be able to share Quibi content on social media, but there’s no estimated time frame for when that feature will become available.

(Disclosure: Vox Media is partnered with Quibi on two shows and there are discussions for a Verge show in the future.)

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right,” Katzenberg said, “but now that there are hundreds of people on there using it, you go, ‘Uh-oh, we didn’t see that.’”

People also couldn’t take screenshots inside the app. Although that restriction isn’t unique to Quibi (Netflix and Disney Plus deal with the same problem in their mobile apps), without a desktop version of the app for people to watch Quibi shows on, the only way for people to share scenes was to use another phone to record the episode playing. So that’s what people did, managing in some cases to go viral. It’s unclear if people will be able to screenshot or if Quibi will allow direct sharing of clips from the app to various social media apps. The Verge has reached out for more information.

“There are a whole bunch of things we have now seen in the product that we thought we got mostly right”

Another feature coming to Quibi’s iOS app this week is the ability to stream shows and “movies-in-chapters” on TV screens. There’s no further explanation for how people will do this — considering the feature is rolling out to iOS first, the implication would be that it’s using AirPlay. Android users might have to wait a bit longer for Chromecast support. The bigger-screen experience was always part of the plan, but CEO Meg Whitman has admitted in the past that if they knew COVID-19 was going to happen, they might have launched with the feature.

It’s also unclear if or how the “turnstyle” technology — the bread-and-butter behind Quibi’s pitch to subscribers that orients videos based on how you hold your phone — will work if it’s playing on a television set, which cannot be rotated.

Right now, the goal seems to be getting more people talking about and watching Quibi: social media can help turn Quibi shows into viral memes (see: Netflix’s Tiger King), and allowing people to watch shows on their television gives subscribers another viewing choice. Quibi currently has about 3.5 million app downloads and 1.3 million active users, according to Katzenberg.

That’s a far cry from Disney Plus’ nearly 55 million subscribers and YouTube’s more than 2 billion monthly users, 70 percent of which use the app on their phone. Quibi isn’t available globally (like YouTube) and doesn’t have a library of popular intellectual property (like Disney), which makes growth more difficult.

Its shows haven’t received positive reviews, and interest in the streaming service has plummeted since its initial launch on April 6th. Comparatively, most other streaming services have seen an uptick in views. People don’t seem interested in Quibi, and that’s the issue Katzenberg is trying to fix. Whether the novel coronavirus is entirely to blame, as Katzenberg suggested, is questionable. Industry insiders argued before Quibi’s launch that it would be difficult trying to sell a product in a highly competitive market that didn’t seem like it was particularly needed.

But Katzenberg acknowledged the team is far from happy with the results. “Is it the avalanche of people that we wanted and were going for out of launch?” Katzenberg told the Times. “The answer is no. It’s not up to what we wanted. It’s not close to what we wanted.”",real
2005,377,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/coronavirus-cases-news.html,2020-04-20,Coronavirus Death Toll Soars in Turkey; W.H.O. Warns of Vaccine Roadblock,"
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
Istanbul deaths suggest a wider outbreak than Turkey admits.Turkey has surpassed China in its number of confirmed coronavirus cases, as the tally rose to more than 90,000 by Monday, with deaths reaching at least 2,140, according to official government figures. But the true death toll may be much higher.
Data compiled by The New York Times from records of deaths in Istanbul indicate that Turkey is grappling with a far bigger calamity from the coronavirus than official figures and statements indicate. The city alone recorded about 2,100 more deaths than expected from March 9 to April 12, based on weekly averages from the last two years, far more than officials reported for the whole of Turkey during that time.
While not all those deaths are necessarily directly attributable to the coronavirus, the numbers indicate a striking jump in fatalities that has coincided with the onset of the outbreak, a preliminary indicator that is being used by researchers to cut through the fog of the pandemic and assess its full toll in real time.
The government maintains that it acted swiftly, stopping flights and border crossings from five of the most affected countries in February and closing schools, restaurants and bars in mid-March when the first case of infection was confirmed.
But by then, the statistics compiled by The Times show, the damage was done. And medical professionals say that Turkey did not do enough to halt international travelers, and neglected contact tracing and community care.
“In February, they did nothing, although it was known the disease was there,” Dr. Sinan Adiyaman, head of the Turkish Medical Association, said in an interview.
The government announced its first death from Covid-19 on March 17. But the statistics compiled by The Times suggest that even around that time, the number of deaths overall in Istanbul was already considerably higher than historical averages, an indication that the virus had arrived several weeks earlier.
Any death statistics in the midst of a pandemic are tricky to pin down and must be considered preliminary. Many European countries are engaged in trying to improve their death statistics, which they now acknowledge are incomplete.
There are many hurdles to developing and widely distributing a vaccine, a W.H.O. official warned.
The head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program warned on Monday that even if a vaccine against the coronavirus were quickly developed, manufacturing and distributing it could prove extraordinarily difficult.
There is no approved treatment for or vaccine against infection with the coronavirus. More than two dozen companies have announced vaccine programs; at least three candidates already are in human trials.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned that a vaccine is at least 18 months away. Other experts say even that timeline is optimistic.
The development process is important, but manufacturers must begin planning to scale up manufacturing capacities to meet global demand when a successful vaccine is discovered, said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program.
Billions of people around the globe eventually may need vaccination. Modern vaccines, made with DNA and RNA, require specialized facilities; it is not clear who could make them.
And it will be important that vaccines go where they are most needed, not simply to the countries that can afford them. The W.H.O. is working with government leaders and nonprofits like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to ensure that means for equitable vaccine distribution are in place when the time comes, Dr. Ryan said.
“We’ve worked for over 20 years trying to ensure that products like vaccines are distributed in emergencies on the basis of epidemiological need,” Dr. Ryan said at a news briefing. “We intend to do exactly the same here.”
The agency has a long history of distributing vaccines to countries in need, including the meningitis, yellow fever, cholera and polio vaccines. Yet mass vaccination campaigns are still logistically difficult and often met with resistance in the community.
“As a global health architecture, we’re not very good at delivering vaccines in people other than children — in adults,” Dr. Ryan said.
“If this is to work, it will require one of the greatest scientific, one of the greatest political, one of the greatest financial, one of the greatest public health operations in a generation,” he added.
Germany cautiously restarts its economy, allowing small shops to open.
Across Germany, smaller stores were allowed to open their doors on Monday for the first time in nearly a month, under initial measures to ease restrictions imposed in March as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Germans are still required to stay at least five feet from one another at all times until the end of April.
“We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a news conference on Monday, warning that the consequences of the new measures would be visible only in two weeks’ time. “That is what makes the situation so difficult.”
Norway, the Czech Republic and Denmark, all lifted some restrictions on Monday, attempting to balance public health against economic revival. Across Europe, the confirmed coronavirus toll passed one million infections and 100,000 deaths, according to the European Center for Disease Control.
Rana Basar reopened her jewelry and accessories shop in the normally bustling Ottensen shopping district of Hamburg on Monday, but said it had been a quiet start.
“It is not like people are in the mood to go shopping,” she added.She prepared her store, Junajoux, with disinfectant and markings on the floor to help the two to three customers allowed in at a time to keep the required distance, as well as a mask to wear when customers are present. One of the biggest challenges, she said, was organizing care for her two children, because schools remain closed.
“A lot of this has not been fully thought through,” Ms. Basar said.In Rostock, where the local zoo was one of several in the country allowed to reopen, around 1,000 people — roughly half of normal numbers — were expected to visit the animals that could be viewed from outside, as indoor exhibits remained closed. All large gatherings have been banned until the end of summer.
Germany has recorded 141,672 coronavirus cases, with 4,404 fatalities, but the rate of infection has been steadily slowing in recent days and the country’s health system has been able to cope with the strain.
The latest in science: Six feet between tables may not be enough distance to safely reopen restaurants.
In January, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, one diner infected with the novel coronavirus but not yet feeling sick appeared to have spread the disease to nine other people. One of the restaurant’s air-conditioners apparently blew the virus particles around the dining room.
There were 73 other diners who ate that day on the same floor of the five-story restaurant, and the good news is they did not become sick. Neither did the eight employees who were working on the floor at the time.
Chinese researchers described the incident in a paper that is to be published in the July issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The field study has limitations. The researchers, for example, did not perform experiments to simulate the airborne transmission.
That outbreak illustrates some of the challenges that restaurants will face when they try to reopen. Ventilation systems can create complex patterns of air flow and keep viruses aloft, so simply spacing tables six feet apart — the minimum distance that the C.D.C. advises you keep from other people — may not be sufficient to safeguard restaurant patrons.
The social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled into the air through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and sneezes.
On the other hand, all of the people who became sick at the restaurant in China were either at the same table as the infected person or at one of two neighboring tables. The fact that people farther away remained healthy is a hopeful hint that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through larger respiratory droplets, which fall out of the air more quickly than smaller droplets known as aerosols, which can float for hours.
Filipino nurses work the front lines in foreign lands.
Each year about 13,000 nurses leave the Philippines for jobs in wealthier countries, sending money back home, often living in bare-bones conditions, far from familiar places and people.
Covid-19 has required them to make an additional sacrifice: risking their health and their lives  by caring for the sick. In places with major coronavirus outbreaks, nurses and doctors working in hospitals have been among the people most likely to become infected.
The virus has killed at least seven Filipino employees of Britain’s National Health Service, and in the United States it has claimed the lives of at least five nurses and a doctor from the Philippines.
The threat is as real as can be to Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, 27, a nurse who treats Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital in York, England.
Last month, her aunt, Araceli Buendia Ilagan, 63, an associate supervisor in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit of a hospital in Miami, died of the disease. An uncle, a nurse in California, is hospitalized with the virus.
Ms. Buendia is one of four nurses from the Philippines sharing a house in York.“The common denominator is that we’re all scared,” she said.
Western countries rely heavily on health care workers from other parts of the world — about one-sixth of the nurses working in the United States are immigrants — and even with that recruitment, there are labor shortages. The Philippines produce particularly large numbers of nurses.
In response to the pandemic, the Philippine government has temporarily barred health workers from leaving the country, saying that going abroad would put them at risk, and that they were needed at home.
As new U.S. hotspots emerge and Washington stays at an impasse, governors grapple with reopening.
As Massachusetts and some prisons become hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, President Trump and Democratic lawmakers remained deadlocked on Monday over a bill to keep paychecks flowing to small business employees.
More evidence emerged that New York, the hardest-hit state, had reached a plateau — a tragically high one — as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported 478 more Covid-19 deaths, the lowest one-day figure in more than two weeks. (The state’s total of more than 14,000 deaths does not count what New York City says are 3,700 presumed Covid-19 deaths among people who were never tested for the virus.)
In some parts of the country, the virus continues to spread quickly. Massachusetts now has the third-most confirmed infections of any state, with more than 38,000, and the fourth-most deaths, with more than 1,700.
A New York Times analysis shows that four of the country’s 10 largest sources of new infections are prisons or jails. An Ohio state prison is the biggest source, with 1,828 inmates and 103 employees infected.
More than 770,000 people nationwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and more than 37,000 have died, according to data collected by The Times — and experts say the true figures are likely much higher.
New York offered a small suggestion of good news on Monday, starting a program to test people for coronavirus antibodies. The accuracy of the testing remains in question, but if successful, it could indicate how many people have some immunity and who they are, which are important steps toward jumpstarting the economy.
 Singapore seemed to have coronavirus under control. Then cases doubled.
After recording its first coronavirus case on Jan. 23, Singapore did almost everything right.The prosperous city-state traced the close contacts of every infected patient, shut the borders to populations likely to carry the contagion, and provided free testing and treatment.
But over the past few days, Singapore’s caseload has more than doubled, with more than 8,000 cases confirmed as of Monday, the highest in Southeast Asia. Most of the new infections are within crowded dormitories where low-paid migrant laborers from South Asia and China live, unnoticed by many of the country’s richer residents and, it turns out, the government itself.
The group proved a major blind spot in the coronavirus pandemic, exposing the starkly different experiences of rich expatriates and poorer ones in a city-state where 40 percent of residents are foreign born.
Most of the cases among migrant workers are mild or asymptomatic, and none have required critical care, perhaps explaining why the dormitory outbreaks at first went unnoticed. In total, 11 people in Singapore have died of Covid-19, a relatively low fatality rate.
Tens of thousands of Singaporeans have donated funds for the well-being of migrant workers, and the expectation is that the government will deliver on its vow to treat them better. For now, though, the country is reeling from the pandemic’s assault on some of its most defenseless people.
Iran eases restrictions on some businesses.
Iran continued its gradual rebooting of its economy on Monday by reopening traditional bazaars and modern shopping malls and lifting travel restrictions around the country.
The government has called its plan “smart distancing,” rather than the strict social distancing measures imposed by most other countries hoping to flatten the rate of infection as they fight the coronavirus pandemic. But not much distancing was observed as commuters packed trains and buses and shoppers crowded the narrow, winding passageways that shape Tehran’s traditional bazaar.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said he was considering opening religious shrines, a potential vector for spreading the virus, two weeks earlier than scheduled based on requests from custodians of the religious centers.
Health officials in the country, one of the first outside China to be hit hard by the virus, continued to warn that another surge of patients and deaths was inevitable. Different branches of the government sent conflicting messages to the public about the pros and cons of easing restrictions while the contagion had not been contained, testing was not widely available and the numbers of patients and deaths continued to surge.
“Contact among the public has increased with the opening of shopping centers and people moving around on public transportation,” said Alireza Zali, the head of Iran’s coronavirus relief committee. There has been a steady increase in people contracting the virus and being hospitalized, Mr. Zali said, including a 2 percent increase in patients being admitted to intensive care units within the past 24 hours.
The health ministry said on Monday that 1,294 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and that 91 people had died. Iran’s official tally stands at 5,209 people dead and 83,505 infected.
Oil prices nosedived as the worldwide surplus grew.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday over growing concerns that the collapse in demand has far outstripped attempts to curb production and store the excess supply.
The price of the main U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, actually fell below zero — meaning that some sellers, fearing they would be unable to sell the oil and would have no place to put it, were willing to pay people to take it.
That stunning drop was largely a short-term aberration driven by the timing of futures contracts, but it highlighted the underlying severe damage to oil markets from the worldwide glut.
Other oil prices, less affected by futures, also fell, but not as drastically. Brent crude, an international benchmark, dropped more than 6 percent, below $27 a barrel — less than half its price two months ago.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Stocks slumped, as well, with the S&P 500 index losing 1.8 percent on the day.
With much of the world in lockdown because of the pandemic, global demand for oil has collapsed, leading to record surpluses.
On April 12, major exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day, beginning in May, but that was not nearly enough to compensate for the drop in demand. Analysts estimate that consumption in April will have fallen by three times that amount.
At the same time, oil storage tanks in the United States, especially in the crucial site of Cushing, Okla., are nearing their limits.
As a result, investors have little interest in bidding in the current round of West Texas Intermediate futures trading, which expires on Tuesday, for delivery of oil in May. Under those futures contracts, the crude is delivered to Cushing, but investors are worried that there will be no room to store it there.
The next futures contract for West Texas Intermediate, for delivery in June, fell about 12 percent on Monday, to around $22 a barrel.
Iraq begins to lift restrictions.
Iraqis will join a growing list of nations that are starting to lift restrictions as they continue fighting the coronavirus.
 The Iraqi government decided Monday to loosen a curfew it has had in place for nearly five weeks. It will allow some government employees to return to work and also some private sector workers, including those working in clothing stores and on construction sites.
Iraqis will be allowed to leave their home and neighborhoods from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. for work or for buying food or going to pharmacies or medical appointments.
“Those who are carpenters, blacksmiths, car mechanics, barbers and others are permitted to work during the day as long as no more than three people are in the establishment at one time,” the official order said. Electricians and computer store workers are also included.
Mosques will remain closed and so will restaurants, sporting events and cinemas. Iraq has a relatively low number of cases, 1,574 as of April 20, and 82 deaths.
Iran, which shares a 1,000 mile border with Iraq, has also begun a gradual return to normal life.Russians in the Caucasus mountains march shoulder-to-shoulder to protest lockdown measures.In scenes reminiscent of anti-lockdown protests last week in Michigan and Wisconsin, hundreds of Russians took to the streets of a city in the Caucasus mountains on Monday demanding the resignation of the local governor and the lifting of his stay-at-home order.
The protest in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, was organized by political opponents of the governor, Vyacheslav Bitarov, a Kremlin ally who was appointed to his post by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2016.
Unlike President Trump, Mr. Putin has urged citizens to obey quarantine restrictions and show “discipline and responsibility” in managing an outbreak that he described on Sunday as “under total control” but still not at its peak in Russia.
A mainly Christian pocket in a largely Muslim region, North Ossetia has a long record of loyalty to Moscow, which it looks to for protection and funding. The pandemic, however, has scrambled allegiances and political calculations.
Videos on social media showed people marching shoulder-to-shoulder in Vladikavkaz, in violation of social distancing recommendations backed by the Kremlin. They chanted slogans against the regional government and called on Mr. Bitarov to resign.
As has happened in other countries, anger at business closures and restrictions on movement has fed pre-existing political feuds and rage over corruption. Mr. Bitarov’s demands that people stay home caused fury amid reports that a brewery he owns has been exempted from the lockdown.
Among those supporting the protest was Vadim Cheldiev, a prominent coronavirus skeptic who has dismissed the pandemic as a hoax. In a video posted online on Monday, he said coronavirus “doesn’t exist” but was a pretext to “establish total control over us all.”
OVD Info, a Russian group that monitors arrests, reported that the police detained two suspected organizers of the demonstration, along with several protesters. Officers in riot gear cordoned off government buildings in the city center and drove a crowd of demonstrators from a central square.
Russian news outlets blamed the protest on supporters of Vitaly Kaloev, an infamous former businessman and member of the regional council. Mr. Kaloev was jailed in Switzerland in 2004 for the murder of a Swiss air traffic controller whom he blamed for a plane crash that killed his wife and children.
Released from prison after just three years following intense lobbying by Moscow, Mr. Kaloev returned to a hero’s welcome in North Ossetia, but has bridled in recent years at being passed over by the Kremlin in favor of Mr. Bitarov.
At some hospitals in Israel, relatives can visit dying Covid-19 patients.
Several Israeli hospitals have begun to allow deathbed visits by family members of coronavirus patients, breaking with the strict ban that is in place across much of the world.
Proponents say that one or two relatives making short bedside visits while clothed head-to-toe in protective gear is manageable for hospital workers, and that the benefits outweigh the costs.
Ronni Gamza, chief executive of Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center, said his hospital had adhered to the “default position” of barring all family visits to the coronavirus ward, but said it was over-the-top and, in his view, inhumane.
“We had anxiety, narrow thinking, a little bit of hysteria, and we were too conservative,” he said. Israel’s hospitals have not been overrun like those in some countries, and the new visitation policy has been embraced by several major Israeli hospitals including Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, and Shaare Tzedek and Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem.
Family visits, Dr. Gamzu said, require “less than one percent” of all the personal protective equipment his hospital uses. At peaks in the numbers of critical patients, Dr. Gamzu said, “You could say, ‘We are sorry, we do not have the capacity now.’ But to take that as a standard?”
Dr. Gamzu said he was urging Israeli health authorities to open nursing homes up for visits as well.
Elisheva Stern was one of the first relatives given the chance to visit a dying patient, when she came to her father’s bedside earlier this month. “None of us want to say bye to our family,” she said. “But it’s really a gift.”
Those we’ve lost: Luis Sepúlveda, a noted Chilean writer exiled by Pinochet. ImageLuis Sepúlveda, the Chilean novelist, was jailed by the Pinochet regime and then sent into exile. He died in Spain, hospitalized there early on in the pandemic.Credit...Marta Fernandez/Europa Press, via Associated Press
Luis Sepúlveda, a Chilean writer whose stay among Indigenous people in the Amazon led to his most celebrated novel and who was jailed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, died April 16 in Oviedo, Spain. He was 70.
The cause was the novel coronavirus, according to Tusquets, his publishing house in Barcelona. Mr. Sepúlveda, who was hospitalized in February, was among the first wave of people in Spain to be diagnosed.
Mr. Sepúlveda published several novels, children’s stories and travel books, and he also wrote and directed films. He acquired fame with his novel “The Old Man Who Read Love Stories” (1988), which tells the story of a man who, together with his wife, leaves his mountain village to take part in the colonization of the Amazon.
The book was inspired by Mr. Sepúlveda’s stay in the 1970s with the region’s Shuar Indigenous people. A review in The New York Times by David Unger compared it to one of the early works of Gabriel García Márquez.
“In its simple language and philosophical underpinnings, it is magical, thanks to the author’s skill at describing jungle life,” Mr. Unger wrote. Mr. Sepúlveda wrote the screenplay for a 2001 movie version starring Richard Dreyfuss.
Spain’s outbreak is easing, but its economic woes are just beginning.
Spain said on Monday that 399 people had died from the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the smallest daily percentage increase since a lockdown was imposed in mid-March, up just 1.9 percent up from the previous day. The number of people discharged from hospital is continuing to rise, now surpassing 80,000 recoveries, another sign of improvement.
But another report released on Monday was far less heartening: The country’s central bank warned that the Spanish economy could shrink as much as 13.6 percent this year. It also said that unemployment could rise to almost 22 percent, even excluding the thousands of workers whose contracts have been temporarily suspended under a government program designed to avoid mass layoffs. Spain’s jobless rate was almost 14 percent in February, before the outbreak took hold.
Spain’s restrictions on movement have been some of the strictest in Europe, including orders to keep children inside. A nationwide lockdown has been extended into May, but the government has started rolling back some limits, allowing construction sites and factories to reopen.
Italy, like Spain, is moving carefully toward restoring economic activity, while Britain and France have signaled that they will not relax restrictions until next month.
The restrictions on Spain’s children are set to be loosened starting April 27, though the government has not given details on the changes. Fernando Simón, the director of the national center for health emergencies, said on Monday that it was important to clarify that “children will be able to get out on the street, but it will not be a free exit, to play.”
He added: “It’s not about opening the door and having the neighbors come out.”As it considers reopening the economy, Spain is struggling to recount its dead. The latest figures from the Health Ministry do not match recent adjustments in regions that have taken into account data from funeral homes.
Djokovic would prefer not to get vaccinated to resume playing, but doesn’t rule it out.
Novak Djokovic, the world’s top ranked men’s tennis player, said on Sunday that he would have a difficult decision to make if receiving a coronavirus vaccine became a mandatory condition for competing on the circuit when play resumes.
“Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” Djokovic said in comments reported and translated by Reuters. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.”
Djokovic, the 32-year-old Serbian star who has won 17 Grand Slam singles titles, was speaking with a group of Serbian players on a live Facebook chat when he made the comment. Djokovic is staying in Spain with his wife Jelena and their two children during the lockdown.
In a statement released on Monday through his management team, he declined to say whether he opposed vaccines in general. He made it clear he was intent on exploring other options, but did not rule vaccination out if it became compulsory.
The professional tennis tour has been shut down because of the virus since early March and will resume no sooner than July 13. Wimbledon has been canceled for the first time since 1945 and dozens of tournaments, including the French Open, which was scheduled to be the next Grand Slam tournament, have been postponed.
Wuhan lab rejects U.S. accusation that it was source of outbreak.
The Trump administration suggested that a Chinese laboratory may have been the source of the coronavirus outbreak, but a senior scientist at the lab in question has rejected the accusations, saying there are no signs that the virus was the product of human tampering.
The scientist, Yuan Zhiming, the director of a high-security virus research lab that is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, pushed back against the surge of speculation that the lab may have accidentally leaked the virus or was part of a conspiracy to release it.
“Without any evidence, and without any relationship to logic, he makes these allegations that are totally founded on speculation,” Mr. Yuan said of Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who was an early proponent of the theory that the lab was the origin of the virus.
“I’ve long engaged in biosecurity management and project management in laboratories, and I know this would have been impossible,” Mr. Yuan said in an interview aired over the weekend by CGTN, the Chinese television broadcaster.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the Chinese government “needs to come clean” about the lab, and President Trump has kept the speculation alive, telling reporters that “more and more we’re hearing the story.”
But most scientists have dismissed the idea that the laboratory, built with French assistance, could have been the incubator, even inadvertently, of the new coronavirus. The French government has also said that there was no evidence of a link between the coronavirus and the lab.
But Mr. Yuan also ruefully suggested that no denial would halt the suspicions. “I’m also sure that as long as the outbreak continues, especially abroad, these suspicions or discordant voices will never disappear,” he said.
After second wave of infection, Hong Kong has first day with no new cases.
Hong Kong reported no new coronavirus cases on Monday, the first time since a second wave of imported infections hit the semiautonomous Chinese city in early March that there were no new daily infections.
The city has recorded 1,026 cases and four deaths since January, but cases tripled after residents returned to the city from hot spots in the United States and Europe last month. Hong Kong closed its borders to all nonresidents and shut gyms, movie theaters and government offices, and residents returning to the city are tested before they are allowed to return home for two weeks of self isolation. Fewer than 10 new cases were reported in more than a week.
The government also announced on Monday that residents returning to the city on late afternoon or evening flights would be required to stay overnight at a designated hotel until they are able to receive test results the following day.
Medical experts warned that the city would have to record at least two incubation periods — or 28 days — before they could rule out further outbreaks, adding that many carriers of the disease do not show symptoms or fall ill.
Despite the downward trend in transmissions, social distancing restrictions are still in place in Hong Kong. Schools have been closed since late January, and final exams that normally take place in late April were canceled. Government offices, gyms and movie theaters remain closed, and gatherings of more than four people are banned.
Australia and New Zealand ease lockdowns as new infections drop.
Australia and New Zealand announced plans on Monday to ease lockdown restrictions as both countries have managed so far to control coronavirus outbreaks, reporting  just a few new infections each day.
Careful and calibrated, the plans include a return to school for some children in the coming weeks as well as allowances for slightly more business activity, more freedom to exercise outdoors and the potential for gatherings of more than two people.
In Sydney, a few beaches reopened for exercise on Monday, leading to the return of surfers. In Maroubra, a coastal southern suburb, lifeguards used megaphones to warn surfers, runners and swimmers to stay physically distanced.
Many who ventured out expressed relief and awe at what the past month had brought. “I’m just kind of laughing,” said Paul Beswich, 55, one of many residents who welcomed the chance to go for a swim. “I’ve lived here all my life, and we’ve always been told that if you’ve got a virus, go flush it out in the water. Now we can.”
Australia and New Zealand have benefited from an early, aggressive response to the pandemic. In Australia, public health laboratories started building test kits in January.
As of Monday, the country had tested more than 422,000 people, and confirmed 6,619 confirmed and 71 deaths. None of its hospitals are overwhelmed. For eight straight days, the country has recorded fewer than 50 new cases, after a daily peak of nearly 500 on March 28. That was roughly when the government asked people to stay home, with the exception of essential activities, including shopping and exercise.
New Zealand’s restrictions were more severe, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing a total lockdown on March 25, asking New Zealanders to act as if they had the virus. The restrictions produced a result roughly in line with Australia’s. New Zealand has recorded just over 1,100 infections and 12 deaths after conducting 85,000 tests from a population of nearly 4.9 million.
Starting next Monday, it will begin to allow slightly more activity. Construction will be allowed to restart. Schools will reopen as of April 28 to some students, and funerals and weddings of up to 10 people could be allowed.
“Stay strong, stay home, be kind, and let’s finish what we started,” Ms. Ardern said on Monday.
U.S. ambassador in Kenya ignites outrage over virus criticism.
Comments from the top United States diplomat in Kenya have caused an uproar after he said that only a small part of the country’s population was adhering to rules aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
In a Twitter post on Sunday, the ambassador, Kyle McCarter, wrote, “Only a fraction of the wananchi are wearing masks and social distancing,” using the Swahili word for citizens.
“None of us know the magnitude of this Wuhan flu,” he continued, “but we must take basic known wise precautions. It is only for a short time.”
The comment sparked outrage, with some noting that social distancing was an unimaginable luxury for poor people living in overcrowded and cramped conditions. Others also questioned how he came to his conclusion given that Nairobi was on partial lockdown and movement in and out of the city was banned. Mr. McCarter doubled down writing in a follow-up post, “The further you get from Nairobi the less compliance there is. Trust me.”
When Twitter user Allan Ogera questioned him on the number of masks the United States has donated to Kenya, Mr. McCarter retorted, “You would not be able to test in Kenya if not for USA marafiki,” which means ‘friends’ in Swahili.
Some social media users also criticized the ambassador’s decision to call the coronavirus “Wuhan flu,” saying he was “trying to please” President Trump who nominated him for the post in 2019 and who has insisted on calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” The disease is thought to have first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Kenya has 270 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to the latest figures, and a total of 14 deaths. To curb the spread of the virus, authorities have mandated the wearing of masks, imposed a nationwide dusk to dawn curfew, closed the biggest shopping district in the capital  and introduced partial lockdowns in four out of the country’s 47 counties.
Thousands who died in Italy’s nursing homes were not counted among fatalities.
The coronavirus outbreak tore through communities in northern Italy and overwhelmed the health care system with such force that only now is the true scale of the outbreak beginning to emerge. Like other hard-hit countries, including China and Spain, Italy has had to revisit its tally of the dead.
Health experts in Italy say they now believe thousands of nursing home residents were initially unaccounted for. A recent survey by Italy’s national health institute estimated that 40.2 percent of the 6,773 people who died in Italian nursing homes between Feb 1 and April 14  had either a confirmed case of Covid-19 or symptoms consistent with the infection.
“We observed that most deaths occurred in the second half of March, at the peak of the Covid infection, while some of the earlier deaths coincided with the influenza season,” said Graziano Onder, director of the Aging Department at the National Health Institute, which presented the data on Friday. Only the 364 nursing home residents who had tested positive were included in the official toll kept by the country’s Civil Protection Department.
The actual number of Covid-19 deaths in these nursing homes may never be known because initially testing was infrequent.
“Because the swabs were so difficult to obtain, at first priority was given to hospitals,” Dr. Onder said. “Only more recently were nursing homes added to the priority list.”
About a third of Italy’s 3,420 public or publicly funded nursing homes, which serve around 80,000 people, participated in the survey, which also sought to monitor the difficulties these structures faced during the early weeks of the outbreak. Shortages of masks, gloves and other protective equipment were reported most frequently.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed an executive order Saturday extending the deadline to submit applications for cannabis infuser, craft grower and transporter licenses from March 30 to April 30, according to a statement from the Illinois Department of Agriculture. All applications must be submitted by certified mail.

The applications were initially due March 16, but state officials earlier this month extended that deadline and ordered the agriculture department to accept all applications by mail in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

The 40 licenses to operate small-scale grow centers will be awarded by July 1. Another 40 licenses will go to infusers which will manufacture processed pot products, like edibles. An unspecified number of transport licenses will allow companies to deliver marijuana on behalf of growers, dispensaries or community colleges with licensed pot training programs.

“While there is no limit on how many transporter licenses will be awarded, applicants must score at least 75% of the available points and meet all other requirements before being granted a transporter license,” the agriculture department wrote in the statement.

Application fees of $5,000 will be cut in half for applicants that meet social equity requirements by living in an area adversely affected by past drug policies, having a pot-related record or having a family member that meets the criteria.

The licenses carry an annual $40,000 fee for craft growers, $10,000 for transporters and $5,000 for infusers.",real

J.B. Pritzker apologized for criticizing baseball players for bargaining over their salaries during talks with management on how to get the coronavirus-delayed season under way.

Pritzker faulted players on Tuesday, saying “I realize that the players have the right to haggle over their salaries” but adding “I’m disappointed in many ways that players are holding out for these very, very high salaries and payments during a time when I think everybody is sacrificing.”

At his briefing on Wednesday, he said “I want to address something that I said yesterday, regarding baseball and baseball players.”

“I want to apologize for leaving the impression that baseball players shouldn’t have the right to bargain, to protect their health and safety,” Pritzker said. “I absolutely support that right, and I should have made that more clear.”

Players agreed in March to accept prorated shares of salaries during a shortened season as part of a deal that guaranteed them service time if no games are played.

Owners on Monday approved a proposal for an 82-game season. Concerned about losing money if games are played without fans, owners approved asking players to base their salaries on a 50-50 split of revenue. Players say that amounts to a salary cap and they will never agree to that framework.

He’s repeatedly touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a supposedly useful treatment against the Coronavirus, but there has never been any kind of systematic evidence of the drug’s actual effectiveness. Now, there’s a new study available outlining how among tens of thousands of Coronavirus patients, the drug was actually linked to a documented higher risk of death. This week, Hillary Clinton called out Trump for recklessly endangering lives with his glib promotion of the drug.

Antimalarial drug touted by Pres Trump is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to one study.

Trump has actually been taking the drug himself, too. He started taking the drug, supposedly, after one of his personal valets tested positive for the Coronavirus, although again, there has never been any kind of systematic evidence that the drug is actually useful for preventing the virus. In fact, one recent story circulated of a woman who contracted the Coronavirus even after she took the drug in question for 19 years as a treatment for lupus, which it’s actually approved for and useful against.

The latest study covering tens of thousands of patients is not the first suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus patients. One study outlining results from the VA hospital system has already revealed that among veterans, the drug was also linked to a higher risk of death among Coronavirus cases. None of these developments have seemed to faze the president away from his commitment to promoting his attempts at some kind of magic fix.

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim and chief medical officer Tal Zaks dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement of what it described as 'positive' results from its vaccine trial.

The two executives pocketed almost $25 million in profits in a day's work before experts cast doubt on the vaccine's success and sent shares tumbling.

Kim exercised 241,000 options for $3 million Monday, then instantly sold them for $19.8 million, taking a tidy profit of $16.8 million, SEC filings seen by CNN Business show.

On Tuesday, Zaks exercised $1.5 million stock options before making a profit of $8.2 million when he immediately offloaded them for $9.77 million.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, after it released promising results of its COVID-19 vaccine trial

Moderna's chief financial officer Lorence Kim (left) and chief medical officer Tal Zaks (right) dumped the staggering value of stocks on Monday and Tuesday when the share price skyrocketed following the company's announcement over its vaccine trial

The biotech company released results from its COVID-19 vaccine trial Monday, after it became the first US company to start a clinical trial for a vaccine back in March.

This sparked hope that a vaccine for the deadly virus could make it to market by January and sent Wall Street investors into overdrive.

Stocks in Moderna surged as much as 30 percent Monday to $87 a share, and the company's market value climbed to $29 billion.

While investors raced to get a slice of the firm, the two insiders CFO Kim and CMO Zaks dumped the near-$30 million of shares between them on Monday and Tuesday.

According to filings, Kim also offloaded stocks in the days before the results of the trial were announced, selling 20,000 shares worth $1.3 million on May 15.

The timing of the sales may appear suspicious but Moderna insisted this week's sales from the two insiders were executed under automated insider trading plans, known as 10b5-1 plans.

Such plans lay out future stock trades at set prices or on set dates, with transactions typically being carried out without the insiders taking any action.

'These transactions are executing automatically pursuant to these trading plans,' the company said.

Experts have said this means the deals are perfectly legal.

Andrew Gordon, director of research services at Equilar, told CNN Business the executives' actions would only pose a 'legal issue if they created or modified their 10b5-1 plan while in possession of material insider information.

'It's not uncommon for insiders to sell shares they own, nor is it bad for them to capitalize on the current stock price.'

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the apparent success of the vaccine trials.

The company's share price wavered more as the week went on as the medical community gave a mixed response to the success of the vaccine trials. Dr Fauci called the trials 'optimistic'

Health website Stat cast doubt on the vaccine Tuesday, saying not enough information was available to understand if the phase one trial was a success and sending shares down to $71.67 that day.

Shares fell further to a low of $67.05 Thursday, down 16 percent from its Monday close.

Other experts have also voiced their skepticism over the trials.

Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Nature.com he was 'not convinced' by Moderna's claims.

'I'm not convinced that this is really a positive result,' Hotez said.

Shares then went up again Friday to $68.60 after Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top immunologist, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about Moderna's vaccine.

'Although the numbers were limited, it was quite good news because it reached and went over an important hurdle in the development of vaccines. That's the reason why I'm cautiously optimistic about it,' Fauci said at a CNN town hall on Thursday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci is head of, is developing the vaccine in collaboration with Moderna.

Dr. Carlos del Rio, an Emory University professor of medicine which is testing Moderna's vaccine, echoed Fauci's optimism in an interview with CNBC Friday.

'I am cautiously optimistic. We are developing at a pace that has never been done before,' he said.

Here are the top tests ranked by accuracy, and where you can find them.","Nearly 200 companies are making tests that can tell if people had the novel coronavirus.

Called antibody or ""serology"" tests, they look for antibodies the body produces after infection.

But even as millions flood the US healthcare system, their accuracy is wide-ranging.

Sparingly few have demonstrated 100% sensitivity to the antibodies, though with small sample sizes.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Nearly 200 companies are creating tests that aim tell people if they've been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

Unlike a test that diagnoses the virus itself, the goal of these kits is to identify past exposure by looking for antibodies the body made to fight off the virus. Generally, antibodies stick around for weeks, months, or sometimes years after infections — and they often confer some level of immunity to the disease in question.

It's not yet understood how long and how well antibodies might protect a person from contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Nevertheless, experts have said large-scale antibody testing is necessary to help safely reopen the country. Employers are thinking about using it to determine which people should go back to work, and when. States, hospitals, academic centers, and laboratories are rolling them out to healthcare workers, children, and every day people with growing frequency.

But the accuracy of coronavirus antibody tests is being called into question, partly due to earlier, relaxed approval requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration. Companies rushed their kits into the US healthcare system after varying degrees of study; when problems with those tests began to pop up, the FDA released tougher approval criteria on May 4.

That said, larger healthcare groups are now offering tests to US consumers by the millions while researchers continue to independently study the performance of tests.

Quest Diagnostics is offering tests through Abbott Laboratories, PerkinElmer's Euroimmun business, and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, for instance. Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) is only offering Euroimmun's test, according to a spokesperson for the company, but for way less money than Quest's program.

The costs of antibody tests currently available to consumers ranges widely, from free (through some medical insurance policies or population surveys) to more than $100. Primary care physicians can order antibody tests for patients. You can also find them through government survey programs. New York City, for example, offers antibody tests to any children with COVID-19 symptoms through NYC Health + Hospitals, which is also using Abbott's kit.

If you're symptomatic and can't take a diagnostic test to detect the virus itself, such as through a spit or nasal swab sample, medical experts told Business Insider that it's best to wait a while before getting an antibody test. (The body takes some time to make them, so antibody tests become most accurate starting about two weeks after symptoms begin.)

The following list includes companies that have emergency authorization from the FDA, plus one with a high-performing test that doesn't yet have agency approval. Results are ranked by test sensitivity, or ability to detect true positives, though separate scores pertaining to specificity, or ability to detect true negatives, are also included. The scores are based on internal studies conducted by the companies, as well as external ones where available.",real

I don’t agree with them in areas such as how to raise or discipline my children. If I try to explain why, they mock me with their tone of voice. Then they get mad if I try to discuss it with them and won’t speak to me for a couple of weeks.

Currently, they are insisting that I am making a mountain out of a molehill because of the coronavirus. I stay at home with my children and run out only to buy food. Abby, my parents are ignoring all the health recommendations. They still go out in public places where people are close to each other.

They now want to have all their grandkids over to play and are upset with me because I refuse. It has reached the point that I don’t answer my phone when I see Mom’s number because I know she’ll lecture me on how I am “tearing the family apart over this nonsense that we’ll just laugh about next year.” How do you get family members to respect your request for social distancing? — DOING WHAT’S RIGHT FOR NOW

DEAR DOING: Here’s how: Stick to your guns. Remind your mother that your children’s welfare is your sacred responsibility. It is your job to ensure their safety, and it’s no laughing matter. Tell her this is why you have chosen to follow the directions issued by the Centers for Disease Control. You wish she and your dad would be more careful about their own health, but you respect that they are adults making their own choices, and you expect that she will extend to you the same courtesy. Period!

DEAR ABBY: I recently gave a family member a gift. Immediately upon opening it, they exclaimed, “I don’t want this! I will never use this. Can I return it and get something else?” This was followed by repeatedly saying they didn’t want the item and dragging out of the closet a similar item another family member had given them, exclaiming, “See? I already have almost the exact same thing, and I’ve never used it.”

This relative kept repeating they didn’t ever want anything like this and what I should always get them. This is the same person, by the way, who buys me whatever they want to get me whether I want it or not, and refuses to listen when I state what I would like as gifts. Am I too sensitive, or is this behavior bad manners? — GIFT HORSE IN WYOMING

DEAR GIFT HORSE: It’s an example of appalling bad manners and lack of gratitude. Because the relative is also unwilling or unable to choose appropriate gifts, why not agree to stop exchanging them? In cases like this, a nice, neutral greeting card would cause fewer hurt feelings.

DEAR ABBY: My husband and I disagree about something, and I’d like you to be the tie-breaker. One of us believes it’s proper to keep the title to a vehicle in the glove compartment of the vehicle alongside the registration and insurance papers. The other thinks it’s foolish and dangerous. What say you? — TIE-BREAKER IN KENTUCKY

DEAR TIE-BREAKER: I say it is better to err on the side of caution and keep the title in a safe deposit box or file cabinet. The same is true for the deed to your home, as well as other important documents.

A report published by the 'Independent Sage' committee, chaired by Sir David King, says that “well-functioning local test, trace, and isolate protocols” – key conditions for the UK government to relax lockdown restrictions – will not be in place by the start of June.

Until [the protocols] are, it is not safe to open schools on June 1.

New modelling shows that the risk to pupils would be halved if UK ministers delayed their proposed school opening date by two weeks, allowing more time for an effective “test, trace and isolate” program to be established, according to the science committee.

The UK government is due to publish scientific evidence on Friday from its own official SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) committee, which is underpinning its plan to allow primary schools to reopen in a safe manner.

PM Boris Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday that 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new coronavirus cases a day, would be in place by June 1. However, the much-heralded NHS contact-tracing phone app will not be ready to be rolled out on the same date as planned.

In recent weeks, teaching unions have advised schools not to engage with the UK government about reopening until official guidance is updated to satisfy safety concerns.

Furthermore, a revolt of 68 – mainly Labour-led councils in England – has pushed Downing Street to admit it will not penalize some 1,500 primary schools who are adamant that they will disobey government calls to reopen on June 1, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The report suggests that if the delay lasted until September it would be even less risky, reducing the coronavirus threat to children below the possibility of death through a road traffic accident.

It comes as Public Health England's (PHE) Medical Director Yvonne Doyle told MPs on Friday morning that “ultimately, it will be for schools to decide” whether they are ready to reopen.

The latest data published by the Department for Health and Social Care on Thursday showed that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 36,000.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends that Americans cancel gatherings of more than 10 people “for organizations that serve higher-risk populations,” and many states have imposed limits on the number of people who can gather for any sort of party or event.

Dave Grossman, who lives in New York City, was supposed to get married in April at an old luxury hotel 25 miles outside the city—but in early March, New York State officials directed residents to cancel any gatherings of more than 50 people. Grossman and his fiancée initially rescheduled their wedding for August, but then the venue announced it was closing for the remainder of the year. Now they’re not sure when, or where, they’ll get married.

Grossman, 44, and his fiancée, 40, both had a specific vision for what they wanted their wedding day to look like. Watching their dream crumble before their eyes, Grossman said, has been devastating: “This was supposed to be the most exciting time—like, We’re getting married soon! Instead, it’s all stress.” Naturally, though, the idea of a smaller, more low-key wedding is now starting to look more and more appealing to the pair.

When the coronavirus first hit, Kristen Maxwell Cooper, the editor in chief of the wedding website The Knot, initially saw a lot of couples push their ceremonies to later this year. But the pandemic has become a more prolonged ordeal than many of those couples expected at first—so some are turning to what Maxwell Cooper and her team at The Knot have dubbed “mini-monies,” for miniature ceremonies. Small enough to comply with size limits on gatherings and also to responsibly practice social distancing, these are pared-down, minimalist events with “usually around 10 people—just their family, maybe,” she said. Some or all of the ceremony “may be virtual. They may have a virtual officiant or something like that.” Maxwell Cooper added that most of the couples she’s seen opt for the mini-mony still plan to have a bigger celebration later on, after restrictions have lifted.

Read: We need to stop trying to replicate the life we had

Amy Jones, a wedding planner in Connecticut, told me that a few of her clients whose weddings were planned for spring and summer 2020 have chucked their original plans for a big event and gone the mini-mony route. This is especially true of those who want to get married on the sooner side so they can start a family. But more common, as Jones and other people who work in wedding-adjacent industries told me, are the clients who are (perhaps optimistically) rescheduling their weddings for the same weekend next year. As a result, scores of weddings that were supposed to take place in 2020 have been moved to 2021, and they land on the calendar on top of the weddings that were already planned for 2021 before the coronavirus arrived.",real
2025,1794,https://www.politico.eu/article/i-love-the-smell-of-coronavirus-in-the-morning/,2020-05-22,"If you have no sense of taste, lock yourself away immediately","Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.

By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”

But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.

Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.

Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”

When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.

Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.

“The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham

But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”

The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.

When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”

A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.

Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",real

Beyond that, White says he is planning on finally putting his 'Fight Island' plan into action - an idea which first emerged when the coronavirus outbreak began to ravage sport in the US.
