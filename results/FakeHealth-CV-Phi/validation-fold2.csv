Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.\n\n""This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,"" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.\n\nThe study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.\n\n""The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don\'t know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,"" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.\n\n""Everything still goes through pathology,"" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.\n\nBoolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.\n\nIn June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel\'s recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.\n\nFor the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.\n\nWhere the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.\n\nTypically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.\n\n""We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,"" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.\n\nAmong women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.\n\nLooking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.\n\nDr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women\'s Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.\n\n""I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,"" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors\' techniques, she said.\n\nThe expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.\n\nThe device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer, the company said.\n\nData and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer surgery, visit the American Cancer Society.']","Room for improvement in quantifying results, in disclosing manufacturer funding of the study, and in giving some idea of what else is being done in this field of research.","We never quite understand the urgency of jumping the gun on reporting on talks not yet presented at a scientific conference – especially when it’s about a device not yet approved by the FDA and when independent perspectives are so crucial.    Yes, this story had one independent perspective, but it may have done much better with more informed perspectives if it at least waited until the talk was presented at the conference.

Using both together resulted in a 51 percent response, compared with a 30 percent response in women given Herceptin alone. Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response.\n\n""What we observed was a massive improvement in response,"" Baselga said.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study.\n\n""Lapatinib was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,"" Baselga said. ""The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?""\n\nBaselga and his colleagues conducted a trial treating 455 women from 23 countries. All had HER2-positive breast cancers. All had tumors larger than about three-fourths of an inch.\n\nIn HER2-positive breast cancer, test results are positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which promotes cancer cell growth.\n\nIn the study, 154 women got Tykerb, 149 Herceptin and the other 152 both drugs. All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.\n\nAt that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.\n\nBaselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.\n\nThe study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, ""affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.""\n\nWhile the combination showed a better response rate, ""there is also an increased level of side effects,"" he noted.\n\nWhile no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.\n\nThe important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That\'s the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.\n\nCost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.\n\nIn another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.\n\nThey assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.\n\nThey looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes. While 30 percent of those in the Herceptin group had this response, 23 percent of the Tykerb group did. The study was funded by drug makers GlaxoSmithKline, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis.\n\nBaselga reports receiving honoraria from Roche; other co-authors report receiving speaking fees or honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline and fees from other drug companies.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about breast cancer, including HER2-positive cancers, visit the American Cancer Society.']",This story danced around the edges of providing vital information – but missed on delivering a clearly understandable story for consumers.,"We gave this story the benefit of the doubt on several jump-ball scoring decisions.

The researchers said this was important, since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia.\n\n“We need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made toward developing a drug treatment,” said Barbara Sahakian from the department of psychiatry at Cambridge University.\n\n“This proof-of-concept study...demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed. (And) because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training.”']","It’s too big a leap to talk about helping people with schizophrenia in their daily lives at home and at work – after a four week study in 22 patients, presumably not all of whom even received the active intervention.","
The story describes study findings regarding an iPad game that appeared to help a small group of schizophrenia patients improve their so-called “episodic” memory — meaning their ability to remember things such as where they may have left their keys. The study discussed in the story evaluated a very small group of people (22), meaning that it may be useful for determining whether it’s worthwhile to pursue a larger study — but that it is impossible to tell whether the iPad game would have any real impact on schizophrenia patients in general. Similarly, the story doesn’t make clear how much improvement the game provided for the patients who participated in the study. The story made a bit of a leap in saying the training helped participants “in their daily lives at home and at work.” Statistical significance was reached on a scale that attempts to measure functioning at home and work, but it’s too much to say with this small group and short-term study whether it actually made a difference. More detail, and a clear statement that this is only the first step in assessing the efficacy of such games for schizophrenia patients, would have been valuable. The story did call it a “proof-of-concept” study, but we don’t think that a general readership will necessarily know what that means.

The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.\n\nRectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.\n\n""Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,"" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet\'s Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. ""Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.""\n\nHowever, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:\n\nStandard therapy, i.e. short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy with direct surgery within a week.\n\nDelayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nDelayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.\n\nThe results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.\n\n""The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,"" says Professor Martling. ""The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.""\n\n###\n\nEighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet.

Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.\n\nFor the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 — the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade — and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.\n\nThe FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a ""breakthrough"" therapy.\n\nSeveral other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.\n\nMelanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.\n\n""The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,"" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ""The pace is unbelievable.""\n\nMore time, quality of life\n\nNo one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.\n\nBut after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.\n\nUnlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.\n\n""The reason we\'re seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,"" Turnham says.\n\nMany of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma\'s ""cloaking device,"" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.\n\nOther drugs — such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib — target growth signals within cancer cells.\n\nNew drugs have fewer side effects\n\nHerry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.\n\nAlthough her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.\n\nThe most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She\'s been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.\n\nOlder melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.\n\nWhen the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.\n\nAt the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston\'s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York\'s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.\n\nOther studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.\n\nA small study of 86 melanoma patients combined ipilumumab and nivolumab, allowing some patients to take the drugs sequentially, and others to take them at the same time. In a subgroup of patients who combined the drugs at the highest dose, 53% saw their tumors shrink by 80% or more, says study co-author Jedd Wolchok of New York\'s Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nIn a study of 122 patients, a Genentech immunotherapy shrank tumors in 39% of patients whose tumors made lots of a particular protein but only 13% of patients whose tumors lacked this marker. While many of these patients had melanoma, the drug — a manmade antibody to block a protein called PD-L1 — also helped control tumors in the lung, kidney, bladder and other organs, Herbst says.\n\nNone of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.\n\nIpilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.\n\n""Doctors will say, \'There are side effects, but they are manageable,\'"" Turnham says. ""Well, \'manageable\' can mean something different to patients.""\n\nTurnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who ""woke up bleeding every morning"" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.\n\nDrugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.\n\n""If you are a patient and someone says, \'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,\' you\'re not going to be so excited.""']",It’s difficult to do an overview of melanoma drug research in a relatively brief story.  But this story did a solid job.,"This story demonstrated how to present context and broad perspective even in advance coverage of big meetings like the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting.

OsteoRx™ is a new joint health system comprised of an OTC topical analgesic combined with a natural antioxidant to support overall joint health.\n\nAn independent clinical research organization conducted the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study by enrolling 60 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. Measurements in the level of pain and range of motion in the affected knee were recorded over a 14-day period for each patient. Independent statistical experts determined that, over the course of the study, patients using OsteoRx™ experienced significantly higher reduction in pain and significantly greater improvement in range of motion than did patients using the competing product.\n\nAfter 48 hours, the average pain reduction for OsteoRx™ users was nearly three times greater than for patients using the competing brand. At seven days, average pain reduction was more than three times greater than the competition. After 14 days of treatment, average pain reduction was more than twice as large as the competition.\n\nAfter just 24 hours, patients using OsteoRx™ experienced an average improvement in range of motion that was more than twice as large as the competition. At 72 hours, OsteoRx™ results were nearly five and a half times better. After 14 days of treatment, the average improvement was still nearly twice as large as the competition.\n\n""Joint pain associated with normal aging and over-exercising is extremely common,"" said Thomas Sullivan, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of HSRx Biopharmaceutical. ""Research funded by U.S. National Academy of Medicine shows that 70 million adults suffer from joint pain, making it the most prevalent source of pain.

Who are the authors? When was it published? What does it prove?,"An Arizona company, HSRx Group, claims it has an over-the-counter (OTC) topical analgesic that is superior to a competitor’s joint relief tablet in relieving joint pain and improving range of motion. But the release contains no evidence from the “independent clinical study” it references in the headline and text.
No study authors are named in the news release, and contrary to a statement in the release, no further information on the study is available on the company website. We reached out to the company to ask for a copy of the research but received no reply.
An online search of Osteo-Rx, the product that’s the subject of the release, led to several sites selling the product in the supplement category, not as an OTC drug. Unlike approved OTC drugs, supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Adding to the confusion, the news release calls the product a topical analgesic, which indicates it’s a cream, but sites selling Osteo-RX online only have it pictured in tablet form.

The technology, Eun says, offers vast benefits in visualization, merging ""your naked eye [with] . . . a camera that has magnification.""\n\nAs Joe Lessman readied his accounting business for the start of tax season last year, he agonized over his doctor\'s recommendation that he have open surgery to remove a cancerous prostate.\n\n""We\'re coming into my busy season, and I just can\'t be on my back for six to eight weeks,"" he told his physician. ""I\'ll be out of business.""\n\nSo Lessman, 49, sought care instead at Pennsylvania Hospital, where a robotic device assists in some surgeries. The radical robotic prostatectomy, performed one Wednesday in January, cleared his early-stage cancer. Lessman was back home in Mantua that Friday, off his pain medication by Saturday, and back to working 16-hour days at his Gloucester County business by Monday. ""My clients didn\'t miss a beat,"" he said. ""I was very fortunate.""\n\nLessman is one of hundreds of thousands of patients across the country to undergo robotic surgery in recent years. Since the first device was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1999, robotic surgery has grown rapidly and is now used in dozens of procedures. Among the most common are removal of the gall bladder, uterus (hysterectomy) prostate, kidney, and uterine fibroids, as well as gastric bypass and mitral-valve repair.\n\nIn traditional surgery, the patient is cut open, and doctors use their eyes and sometimes magnifying devices to see and their hands to operate. Laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery was a major advance because it could be done with a small incision: a laparoscope and surgical instruments were inserted, and the image on a monitor allowed the doctors to control the instruments in their hands from outside the body.\n\nIn laparoscopic robotic surgery, the surgeon is farther removed from the patient. A 3-D camera and machine-held surgical instruments are inserted through small incisions. The surgeon operates while seated at a console nearby. There, the doctor, peering into a monitor that displays a three-dimensional image, manipulates the instruments and camera using hand controls and foot pedals.\n\nProponents say this leads to less-invasive and more-accurate surgery.\n\nBut that does not necessarily mean outcomes are better. Some doctors say more research is needed to prove that certain robotic procedures are superior to other operations.\n\nRecent reports of problematic robotic surgeries have also led to concern about whether all doctors who use the devices have been sufficiently trained.\n\nAnd - as with other types of high-tech equipment that hospitals market aggressively to attract patients who could go elsewhere - the proliferation of robotic systems can mean fewer procedures being done at each institution, a potential problem when higher volume is related to better outcomes.\n\nIn general, patients should seek out surgeons who have done more cases, because they tend to have better results, experts say.\n\nMore than 1,000 da Vinci Surgical Systems, the pre-eminent robotic technology in the United States, have been installed across the country, about 20 of them in the Philadelphia area. The number of surgeries performed using da Vinci rose 51 percent in just one year, to 200,000 in 2009.\n\n""There\'s no question that [robotic surgery] is a big advance,"" said Howard Saul, a gynecological oncologist at the Center for Cancer and Hematologic Disease in Cherry Hill. ""It\'s not going to be a flash in the pan."" Saul is affiliated with the Lourdes Health System, where 410 robotic surgeries were done last year.\n\nSuch sophistication comes with a hefty price tag. At an average of $1.4 million, the da Vinci system represents a major purchase for many hospitals. For patients and insurance companies, there is no significant cost difference between robotic surgery and other operations, although some insurers may pay hospitals less for shorter inpatient stays, said Vipul Patel, founder of the Society of Robotic Surgery and medical director of the Global Robotics Institute in Florida.\n\nSo hospitals and surgeons bear the burden of making the robot financially viable, said Patel, a urologist. A hospital that buys a robot and rarely uses it is likely to lose money, he said. But with efficient, highly skilled surgeons, hospitals can reap financial benefits. ""Robotics are expensive,"" Patel said, ""but depending on how they\'re used, they can make things cheaper.""\n\nFor instance, surgeons say patients who have robotic operations are discharged from the hospital more quickly, are less likely to require blood transfusions, and need less pain medication - all cost savers. The smaller incisions created during robotic procedures typically result in less blood loss and less pain than open surgery, they say.\n\nRobotic surgery may offer other benefits. It represents a vast improvement in visualization, said Daniel Eun, the Pennsylvania Hospital surgeon who operated on Lessman in January. ""It becomes a merging of what you\'d see with your naked eye [with] the enhanced visualization of a camera that has magnification,"" said Eun, the hospital\'s director of minimally invasive and robotic urologic oncology and reconstruction.\n\nSurgeons at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which includes Pennsylvania Hospital, did 1,109 robotic procedures last year.\n\nInstead of the ""chopsticks"" used in laparoscopy, robotic surgery equipment allows for more natural movements, including wrist function, said Saul, the oncologist in Cherry Hill. ""It has more degrees of freedom than your own hand,"" he said. ""You\'re able to get into places where your hand can\'t go.""\n\nAnd, in Saul\'s practice, robotic operations have presented another option for complex patients, such as the elderly and obese. ""We\'ve operated on people that have had five prior surgeries,"" he said.']","It appears that this story was well-intentioned. But the road to hell is paved with such intentions.  In the end, it came up short on evaluating evidence, in seeking truly independent perspectives, and in giving a balanced view. ","Yes, the story included mini-caveats, such as: 
But, no, the story did not quantify any of these major points.  It did not give details or data on meaningful outcomes.  It did not give estimates of how much hospitals spend marketing the technology.  It did not explain what the cost to patients would be.  It did not quantify harms.  And it did not seek truly independent sources’ perspectives.    While there are no carefully controlled studies comparing outcomes between robotic surgery and more traditional approaches, there are analyses examining outcomes in peer-reviewed publications that refute some of the assertions made in this article – assertions that – in the end- threw the story out of balance. 
The story was misleading and is likely to feed into unrealistic patient expectations which might contribute to the disappointment in the outcomes reported by patients.

After their weight had stabilized, each participant followed one of three different diets for four weeks. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. The dieters were admitted to the hospital four times for medical and metabolic testing.\n\nHere’s a look at the three types of diets used in the new study: A low-fat diet, which is about 20% of calories from fat, 60% from carbohydrates, 20% from protein. It emphasizes whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables and cuts way back on oils, nuts, fatty meats and other high-fat foods. A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates, 30% from protein, 60% from fat. This diet emphasizes beef, fish, chicken, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while slashing the consumption of breads, pasta, potatoes, rice, cakes, cookies and starchy vegetables. A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, is made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). It gets about 40% of daily calories from carbohydrates, 40% from fat and 20% from protein. Source: Journal of the American Medical Association\n\nThe diets had the same number of calories, but the fat, protein and carbohydrate content varied. Those diets:\n\n•A low-fat diet which was about 20% of calories from fat and emphasized whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables.\n\n•A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates. It emphasized fish, chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while eliminating foods such as breads, pasta, potatoes and starchy vegetables.\n\n•A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). These foods digest more slowly, helping to keep blood sugar and hormones stable after the meal.\n\nFindings, published in this week\'s Journal of the American Medical Association: Participants burned about 300 calories more a day on a low-carb diet than they did on a low-fat diet. ""That\'s the amount you\'d burn off in an hour of moderate intensity physical activity without lifting a finger,"" says senior author David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\'s Hospital.\n\n""Participants burned 150 calories more on the low-glycemic index diet than the low-fat diet. That\'s about an hour of light physical activity,"" he says.\n\nThe reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says.\n\n""We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don\'t trigger the starvation response. When the body thinks it\'s starving, it turns down metabolism to conserve energy,"" he says.\n\nThe authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease.\n\nLudwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you\'re trying to lose weight, ""you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.""\n\n""The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,"" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. ""It didn\'t slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn\'t seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.""\n\nOn a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.\n\nExperts had different responses to the findings.\n\nGeorge Bray, an obesity researcher at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge who has also studied this topic and who wrote the accompanying editorial in JAMA, says that other studies ""show that you can do well on any diet as long as you stick to it. Adherence is the major key for weight loss and maintenance. There is no magic in any diet.""\n\nEric Westman, a Duke University researcher who has conducted several studies on the low-carb diet and is co-author of The New Atkins for a New You, says this study documents that the ""lower the carbohydrates, the better the metabolic effects. People burn more calories if they eat fewer carbohydrates.""\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, says longer studies conducted among people in their own environments, not with such controlled meals, have shown ""little difference in weight loss and maintenance between one kind of diet and another."" More research is needed to show that interesting results like these are applicable in real life, she says.\n\n""In the meantime, if you want to lose weight, eat less.""']",This story rebounded quickly from an opening sentence flub to provide a more balanced and thorough report than the competing ,"An incorrect opening sentence in the original version of the story (apparently corrected later) was the only significant flaw we found with this story.

In vivo, the researchers evaluated inflammatory responses by TSCs, including infiltration of macrophages (white blood cells that consume damaged or dead cells) and expression of anti-/proinflammatory cytokines, at different time points. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was used in both models to stimulate the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs. The researchers found that CTGF stimulation induced TSCs\' production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, consequently leading to improved tendon healing and matrix remodeling.\n\n""Many would have predicted that tendon healing is inflammation-linked,"" said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, ""but that the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs could be so potent, and so amplifiable, is a striking finding.""\n\n###\n\nSubmit to The FASEB Journal by visiting http://fasebj. msubmit. net , and receive monthly highlights by signing up at http://www. faseb. org/ fjupdate. aspx .

REUTERS/Jerry Lampen\n\nCancer patients given a moderate dose of psilocybin — a hallucinogen with effects similar to LSD — were measurably less depressed six months after a single dose compared with a placebo. Patients seemed somewhat less anxious, they reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nThe pilot study of 12 cancer patients was designed to prove that hallucinogenic drugs could be studied safely as a way to relieve the distress of advanced cancer.\n\nIt revives a promising field of study lasting from the 1950s to the early 1970s that suggested some patients experienced powerful and sustained improvement in mood and anxiety from hallucinogens.\n\nResearchers said the studies were abandoned in the early 1970s when hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD — lysergic acid diethylamide — became widely used on the streets, leading to strict federal laws regulating their use.\n\n“Forty to 45 years ago, the culture was going through tremendous upheaval. These compounds were associated with a very politically active counterculture,” said Dr. Charles Grob of Harbor-University of California Los Angeles Medical Center and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\n“It was something of a public health crisis. Everything had to be shut down,” Grob said in a telephone interview.\n\nFederal law prohibits the use of the magic mushroom compound for any purpose. If it proves effective among late-stage cancer patients, U.S. regulators would need to make special accommodation for its use, Grob said.\n\n‘TIMES HAVE CHANGED’\n\nGrob’s study looked to see whether psilocybin could help ease some of the anxiety of dying cancer patients.\n\nDuring the treatment phase of the study, patients were given a moderate dose of psilocybin and watched closely for six hours. They were told to lie still with their eyes closed as they wore headphones and listened to soothing music.\n\nDuring the placebo phase, each of the 12 patients received a dose of niacin — a vitamin that raises levels of good cholesterol — and given the same instructions.\n\nThe treatments were given in random order and neither the doctors nor the patients were told which compound was administered.\n\nAll the volunteers tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no signs of severe anxiety or a “bad trip.” Most patients showed a trend of improvement in their symptoms of anxiety and at six months, and there was a statistically significant improvement on one depression scale.\n\nGrob said the pilot study proved the drug could be studied safely in cancer patients. He said two other academic research institutions in the United States — Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and New York University — were doing similar studies using a slightly higher dose.\n\n“Times have changed and it’s now possible to pick up this research model again,” he said.\n\nAs many as 14 U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and California voters in November will vote on whether to legalize pot.\n\n“I think that is an indication that there has been a very strong shift within society to move away from the old cultural bias and politics of the process many years ago. I think there is a greater capacity to be open-minded and let science dictate our conclusion, not politics,” Grob said.']","Once again, a media outlet is so enchanted with the idea of an illegal drug having medicinal properties that it fails to fully explore the limitations of the research.", ,2,fake

But a new study shows that people older than age of 70 had good results after arthroscopic surgery of their rotator cuff tears.\n\nThe study, published recently online in Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, looked at results two years after surgery among 39 people age 70 and older who had a full-thickness tear in their rotator cuff.

This is an important topic: is “minimally invasive” arthroscopic surgery a safe and effective treatment for painful rotator cuff tears among men and women age 70 or over?
Unfortunately, the brief article never provided an adequate answer. It relied heavily on a press release. It didn’t offer a critical look at the study the press release promoted. It didn’t mention that the authors of the new study received funding from manufacturers of surgical equipment. It didn’t discuss costs.
Most importantly, the story didn’t provide a balanced view of the overall body of evidence on the treatment of rotator cuff tears.
Like the study and press release, the article suggested that arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery may be a safe and effective treatment for older patients—providing significant pain relief, improvements in strength and range of motion, and return to normal function.
These assertions could all be true. But the new study—a retrospective case series of 40 patients—has design issues that make it incapable of proving those points.
The same holds true for the larger body of evidence on the surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears.  A recent review of 137 studies sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) suggested that there are many potential therapies, surgical and nonsurgical, for painful rotator tears.
However, all the evidence has flaws and no single treatment stands out above others, in terms of proven safety and effectiveness. (See Seida JC et al., Annals of Internal Medicine, July, 2010; see http://www.annals.org/content/early/2010/07/01/0003-4819-153-4-201008170-00263.full)
The LA Times article should have explained that key point. Patients and their physicians can’t make informed choices about treatments for rotator cuff tears without understanding the nature of the evidence—including its flaws.

Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nOne was a low-fat diet that included lots of fruits, low-fat dairy, poultry, whole grains and small amounts of red meat.\n\nThe other two diets were moderately high in fat, with about 34 percent of total calories consumed per day coming from fat. The types of foods and meals were similar to the low-fat diet, but included more nuts and oils.\n\nOne of the moderately high-fat diets included a daily serving of one avocado.\n\nIn one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado.\n\nThe diets were similar in terms of macronutrients (like protein and fats) and calories. The only difference between the two was the avocado — the other diet had the same amount of fat from other sources.\n\nAt the end of the study, the researchers found that the avocado diet led to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, compared with the other two diets.\n\nTo put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Compare that with a decrease of about 7 mg/dL for the low-fat diet, and about a 8 mg/dl drop from the moderate-fat diet.\n\n""I was surprised to see the added benefit [of the avocado],"" Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition scientist at Penn State and the lead author of the study, tells us.""

A mere half-cup of guacamole has about 200 calories all on its own.\n\nKris-Etherton\'s study was funded, in part, by the National Center for Research Resources, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIt was also supported by a grant from the Hass Avocado Board, an industry group that the researchers say had no role in the design of the study or the interpretation of the data.\n\nWe asked Kris-Etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado.\n\n""Oh, absolutely!"" she told us.

Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems.

In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.\n\n""Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,"" explains Dr Heng.\n\nIn this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.\n\nCurcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.\n\nIn recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.\n\nThis study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.\n\n""When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,"" notes Dr. Heng. ""Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.""\n\nThe author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin\'s effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.\n\nThis enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.\n\nDr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.\n\n###\n\nOriginal Source:']",Anecdotal reports are presented as evidence for curcumin as an effective treatment for burns and scalds.,"A case series review published in BioDiscovery follows the recovery of three patients after they are treated with topical curcumin gel. Curcumin is the active substance found in the common spice turmeric, which has been extensively studied in the past half century for its role in treating various conditions. For example, some promising effects have been observed in patients with pro-inflammatory diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and arthritis.
The news release for this journal article does a good job explaining what curcumin is and how this ingredient is recently the focus of many scientific studies. However, it’s not clear from the news release how effective topical curcumin gel really is in treating burns and scalds. For example, the release states curcumin gel “reduces the severity of injury, lessens pain and inflammation and improves health with less than expected scarring” but doesn’t put the claim in numerical context. Furthermore, there is no discussion in the news release on the study limitations, the main one being that the research article is a case series report with no control group. Therefore, it is impossible to attribute the patients’ outcomes to the gel alone.
There is no mention of costs, harms and conflicts of interest, even though the author of this review is the founder of Omnicure Inc, a company manufacturing and marketing topical curcumin gel. We also question the novelty of this treatment approach, since the same three patient cases detailed in the journal article were published in a book in 2011.

When a small amount of Botox is injected into a muscle, it blocks nerve signals that tell muscles to contract.\n\nAtrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\n\n""About a third of all patients undergoing bypass surgery will develop atrial fibrillation, putting them at higher risk for cardiovascular complications,"" said Jonathan S. Steinberg, M.D., senior study author and Adjunct Professor of Medicine at the University of Rochester and Director of the Arrhythmia Institute in the Valley Health System in Ridgewood, New Jersey. ""Atrial fibrillation is also always associated with lengthened hospitalization and that means increased healthcare costs.""\n\nIn two Russian hospitals, researchers randomly assigned 60 patients to receive Botox or saline injections. The injections were made in the four major fat pads surrounding the heart. To avoid bias, neither patients nor doctors knew whether the injections contained Botox or saline.\n\nResearchers found that:\n\nIn the 30 days following surgery, those who received Botox injections during heart bypass surgery had a 7 percent chance of developing AF, compared to 30 percent chance in patients who received saline.\n\nOne year after surgery, none of the patients who received Botox had AF, compared to 27 percent of the patients who received saline.\n\nNo complications from the Botox injections were reported. But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.\n\nThe results must be replicated in larger studies before Botox injections are routinely used to prevent AF after bypass surgery, researchers said. If confirmed in heart bypass patients, Botox injections could also help prevent AF in people undergoing valve repair or replacement. About half of those patients will develop AF after surgery.\n\n""This first-in-man study has opened a whole new line of thinking and research,"" Steinberg said.

And experts warn people to consult their doctor before taking the medication, which increases the risk of bleeding ulcers.\n\n“I like to say you have to make the recommendation about aspirin one patient at a time,” Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, who was not linked to the study, told Reuters Health.\n\nLeFevre worked on the 2009 aspirin recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a federally supported expert panel.\n\nThe task force advises that men age 45 to 79 take aspirin to stave off heart attacks, as long as the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. For women age 55 to 79, aspirin is recommended to prevent strokes, with the same caveat.\n\nThe new work, by Alfred Bartolucci of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and colleagues, was supported by aspirin-maker Bayer AG.\n\nThe research team pooled the results of the nine trials that have tested the drug in the prevention of heart disease so far, including three that weren’t part of the 2009 USPSTF review.\n\nAbout 100,000 men and women age 45 and up took part in the studies. Some were healthy and some had diabetes, but none had chest pain or other symptoms of an ailing heart.\n\nThe researchers found a 19-percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks among participants who took aspirin compared to those who did not.\n\nThey don’t mention how many people actually suffered such a heart attack, but an earlier analysis of six of the trials showed that out of every 1,000 people, 18 individuals taking aspirin had heart attacks every year, compared to 23 individuals taking placebo pills.\n\nOn the other hand, that analysis also found aspirin increased the rate of bleeding from 0.7 to 1 per 1,000 people per year, making the authors conclude the drug was of “uncertain net value.”\n\nHeart disease is the leading killer worldwide and accounts for more than a third of deaths in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association. Every year, heart attacks alone kill some 400,000 Americans.\n\nIn the current study, published in the American Journal of Cardiology, the researchers also report small decreases in stroke and death risks with aspirin, although those changes might have been due to chance.\n\n“It refines our knowledge of how beneficial aspirin is,” Dr. Graham Nichol, an expert in emergency care at the University of Washington in Seattle, said about the study. “I don’t think this paper is inconsistent with previous work.”\n\nNichols, who was not involved in the study, said aspirin is clearly beneficial for people who’ve already had heart disease, and that it also seems to help those at high risk.\n\n“There is not universal agreement on what is high risk,” he told Reuters Health. “In my mind, if you have diabetes or multiple risk factors for heart disease — such as smoking or obesity — it is reasonable to take aspirin.”\n\nIn addition, working to eliminate those risk factors by other means will not only slash the risk of heart disease, but also a host of other health problems.\n\nLeFevre added that while the new study did add extra evidence compared with earlier work, it failed to analyze the effects on men and women separately.\n\nThat muddies the picture because men may see a benefit in the form of fewer heart attacks, whereas aspirin appears to lower the risk of stroke in women.\n\n“We can’t tell from the existing study if that is going to hold up or not,” he said.\n\nOne recent study has suggested that despite the increase in bleeding ulcers from aspirin, the reduction in heart attacks might make the cheap drug cost-effective for men over 45.\n\nThe question then becomes finding out what your risk of heart attack is in the first place, which your doctor can help with.\n\n“The number of events that you prevent depends on your baseline risk,” LeFevre concluded. “A blanket recommendation that everybody should take an aspirin is not a good idea.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/hkVBee American Journal of Cardiology, online April 11, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a good example of explaining limitations, caveats and context to a consumer audience. </span>","This story demonstrates a careful and contextual analysis of the evidence, making clear what the study did show and what it didn’t.

It reduces risks to an ""absolute minimum"" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.\n\n\n\nHis breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.\n\n\n\nReavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground — with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals\' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.\n\n\n\nCalled the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.\n\n\n\nReavill likes to say it\'s ""stupidly simple"" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.\n\n\n\n""It\'s old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,"" Reavill says.\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it\'s self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.\n\n\n\nIn 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.\n\n\n\nA venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a ""pseudo-operative field,"" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital\'s trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.\n\n\n\nDennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a ""tremendous amount of promise,"" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.\n\n\n\nDennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.\n\n\n\n""Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,"" Dennis says. ""You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.""\n\n\n\nSouthern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill\'s catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the ""high 90s,"" Miller says, but ""very few"" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.\n\n\n\nReavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.\n\n\n\nReavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.\n\n\n\n""My wife\'s family is from southern Illinois, too, so it\'s home,"" Reavill says.']","At least on the Chicago Tribune’s website, this story appeared in the Health section – not the local business or feature section. It didn’t address most of the things we think are crucial in a health story.","We understand that a newspaper would find it interesting to report on the human interest angle of someone who grew up on a pig farm who won an award for his invention and who hopes to hire disabled veterans to work on his invention.
But a health story – so categorized by the Chicago Tribune – that includes claims about saving lives, reducing risks to an absolute minimum, and decreasing health care costs – needs to provide some evidence to back up such claims.
This story didn’t deliver that evidence.  It was an impressive job of cheerleading, though.

It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.\n\nYin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.\n\nCao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses\' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.\n\nOver that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn\'t take a regular dose.\n\nThe strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women\'s risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men\'s risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men\'s risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.\n\n""Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,"" Cao said. ""It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.""\n\nNot everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.\n\nRulla Tamimi , the epidemiology chair for the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, thought the presentation was a beneficial one, particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets.\n\n""There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,"" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. ""This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.""\n\nStudies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.\n\nIn April 2016, the US Preventive Service Task Force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low-dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancer-related deaths overall.

The headline overstates what the observational study was capable of measuring. It states “Low-dose aspirin can reduce risk of death from cancer, research says.” That’s incorrect–all that we know from the study is that aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk of death from several cancers. The study wasn’t capable of proving that aspirin “can reduce” cancer death risks. (This is a common problem we see in news coverage.) This framing is echoed throughout the story, unfortunately.
That said, we were glad to see the story discuss some of the risks of taking aspirin and advising people to talk to their doctors first.

But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment — particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat difference, some experts believe, could influence a child’s lifelong health. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section.\n\nThe small proof-of-principle study suggests a new way to inoculate babies, said Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and lead author of the report, published on Monday in Nature Medicine.\n\n“The study is extremely important,” said Dr. Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who did not take part in the work. “Just understanding that it’s possible is exciting.”\n\nBut it will take further studies following C-section babies for many years to know to what degree, if any, the method protects them from immune and metabolic problems, he said.\n\nSome epidemiological studies have suggested that C-section babies may have an elevated risk for developing immune and metabolic disorders, including Type 1 diabetes, allergies, asthma and obesity.\n\nScientists have theorized that these children may be missing key bacteria known to play a large role in shaping the immune system from the moment of birth onward. To replace these microbes, some parents have turned to a novel procedure called vaginal microbial transfer.\n\nA mother’s vaginal fluids — loaded with one such essential bacterium, lactobacillus, that helps digest human milk — are collected before surgery and swabbed all over the infant a minute or two after birth.\n\nAn infant’s first exposure to microbes may educate the early immune system to recognize friend from foe, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nFriendly bacteria, like lactobacilli, are tolerated as being like oneself. Those from hospital ventilation vents or the like may be perceived as enemies and be attacked.\n\nThese early microbial interactions may help set up an immune system that recognizes “self” from “non-self” for the rest of a person’s life, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nIn the United States, about one in three babies are delivered by C-section, a rate that has risen dramatically in recent decades. Some hospitals perform the surgery on nearly seven in ten women delivering babies.\n\nAn ideal C-section rate for low-risk births should be no more than 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDr. Dominguez-Bello’s study involved 18 babies born at the University of Puerto Rico hospital in San Juan, where she recently worked. Seven were born vaginally and 11 by elective C-section. Of the latter, four were swabbed with the mother’s vaginal microbes and seven were not.\n\nMicrobes were collected on a folded sterile piece of gauze that was dipped in a saline solution and inserted into each mother’s vagina for one hour before surgery. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector.\n\nOne to two minutes after the babies were delivered and put under a neonatal lamp, researchers swabbed each infant’s lips, face, chest, arms, legs, back, genitals and anal region with the damp gauze. The procedure took 15 seconds.\n\nDr. Dominguez-Bello and her colleagues then tracked the composition of microbes by taking more than 1,500 oral, skin and anal samples from the newborns, as well as vaginal samples from the mothers, over the first month after birth.\n\nFor the first few days, ambient skin bacteria from the delivery room predominated in the mouths and on the skin of C-section babies who were not swabbed, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.\n\nBut in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. They were all covered with lactobacilli.\n\nGut bacteria in both C-section groups, however, were less abundant than that found in the vaginally delivered babies.\n\nAnal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth.\n\nThe results show the complexity of labor, said Dr. Alexander Khoruts, a microbial expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “It cannot be simplified to a neat, effortless passage of the infant through the birth canal,” he said.\n\nAs the month progressed, the oral and skin microbes of all infants began to resemble normal adult patterns, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But fecal bacteria did not, probably because of breast or formula feeding and the absence of solid foods.\n\nThe transfer fell short of full vaginal birth-like colonization for two reasons, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Compared to infants who spent time squeezed inside the birth canal, those who were swabbed got less exposure to their mother’s microbes.\n\nAnd all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.\n\nA larger study of vaginal microbial transfer is underway at N.Y.U., Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Eighty-four mothers have participated so far.\n\nInfants delivered both by C-section and vaginally will be followed for one year to look for differences in the treated and untreated groups and to look for complications. Thus far the swabbing has proved entirely safe.\n\nThe procedure is not yet recommended by professional medical societies, said Dr. Sara Brubaker, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at N.Y.U. Until more is known, physicians are hesitant to participate.\n\n“But it has hit the lay press,” she said. “Patients come in and ask for it. They are doing it themselves.”\n\nDr. Brubaker is one of them. When her daughter was born three and a half months ago, she arranged to have her baby swabbed.\n\nRelated:\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.']",Generally solid coverage that was too quick to declare this procedure “safe” based on experience with only four babies.,"This is a well-articulated but incomplete story about a proof-of-principle study suggesting that when babies born by C-section are swabbed with their mother’s vaginal fluids, they have a microbiome more closely approximating those of their vaginally-born peers up to a month after birth.

The 50 women treated had progressed despite a median 5 previous treatment regimens. Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least ""stable disease"" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment.

The drug works by targeting the HER2 ""tyrosine kinase"" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.\n\nWorking with Borges\'s Young Women\'s Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called ""triple positive"" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.\n\n""When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,"" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, ""lackluster,"" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.\n\nThe forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.\n\n""Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,"" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug\'s current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.\n\n""I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,"" Borges says. ""And it\'s going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases. The opportunity to study it as a front-line drug for recurrent triple positive breast cancer could even someday help us prevent or delay these brain metastases.""\n\nBecause the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.\n\nOngoing updates are expected in journals and meetings later in 2017.\n\n###']","It’s premature to call results from a short duration, very small phase 1 safety trial life-saving and “practice changing.”","This news release from the University of Colorado’s medical center reports on the results of a phase 1 clinical trial involving 50 women who took the investigational drug tucatinib to treat HER2-positive breast cancer. All of the women in the study previously had taken other cancer drugs, averaging five prior treatment regimens. The news release noted that the data came from a phase 1 study which was primarily focused on establishing the safety of the drug and ensuring that it had some effect; however, it provided confusing information about tucatinib’s effects on the breast cancer’s progress, offered no specific information about potential harms or availability and included inappropriately enthusiastic language about the drug’s importance, given the small size and short study period. In particular, the release quotes one of the study’s authors as saying that “there are women who are alive today because of this drug,” a statement that seems somewhat overblown given the preliminary nature of these findings.

They have prompted calls for a rethink about attitudes towards lithium, given that only an estimated 10% of those with bipolar disorder use it, mainly because patients fear it will cause loss of personality, weight gain and other problems.\n\nThe lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread “lithium stigma” among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be.\n\n“Lithium is a drug with a bad reputation. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. People rightly have suspicions about it. Patients say that the downsides include emotional numbing – feeling that you aren’t connected with your feelings – as well as tremors,” said Dr Joseph Hayes, a psychiatrist at University College London.\n\nBut lithium’s reputation is largely misplaced and based on the experiences of patients from the 1960s to the 1980s who were given too large a dose of the drug, he added. The new research, published in the medical journal PLOS Medicine, found that the side-effects of the mood-stabilising alternatives used by most patients are either the same as or worse than lithium, Hayes said.\n\nThe paper, co-written by Hayes and four colleagues from UCL and Oxford University, concluded that: “Lithium remains an important treatment for individuals with bipolar disorder.” It accepts that “there is clear evidence that its use is associated with a number of adverse events.”\n\nHowever, it adds: “These risks need to be offset with the potentially superior effectiveness and anti-suicidal benefits of the drug compared to other treatment options.”\n\nThe researchers studied a nationally representative sample of 6,671 patients across the UK who were treated for bipolar disorder between 1995 and 2013. Of those, 2,148 had taken lithium, 1,670 had used valproate, 1,477 had been on olanzapine and 1,376 had taken quetiapine. They experienced side-effects including chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, weight gain and high blood pressure.\n\nThe researchers’ analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. They found that patients on lithium had a higher risk of suffering kidney function problems and developing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and also hypercalcemia. However, none of the drugs caused more severe kidney problems.\n\nMeanwhile, lithium patients were less likely to put on weight than patients on the other drugs. While 15%-20% of those on the three other drugs were more likely to gain more than 15% of their body weight, just 10% of those on lithium put on the same amount of extra pounds. Those on olanzapine added the most weight and experienced high blood pressure as a result.\n\nI think many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment Dr Joseph Hayes\n\nSeparate research has shown that patients on the other three medications are 40% more likely to harm themselves than those on lithium. Bipolar disorder carries one of the highest rates of suicide of any mental illness, alongside schizophrenia and alcohol and drug addiction.\n\nThe very limited use of lithium is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advising in 2014 that it should be the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic depression and is characterised by manic highs and bouts of depression. That superseded its previous view, outlined in 2006, that any of the four drugs were useful first lines of treatment for the condition, which affects about one in 100 people.\n\n“Lithium stigma, which includes some people in the psychiatric community, leads to people using drugs that are less effective [than lithium]. To me as a doctor that’s a big worry because my main aim is to help people to be well and if you aren’t doing that with the best available evidence then you are failing patients,” said Hayes.\n\n“I think that many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment. That means that people end up in hospital more often than they need to and end up achieving less in their lives than they could do if they were on lithium. The high suicide rate with bipolar disorder should encourage greater use of lithium. There should be more sensible use of it.”\n\nStephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications for people experiencing mental health problems, including bipolar disorder. But as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done.\n\n“Different people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems. This may be medication, talking therapies, or a mixture of both.”']",Just more discussion around costs and the quality of the evidence was needed.,"This story is about a study on the frequency of different side effects of four drugs used in the treatment of bipolar disorders. The researchers conclude that lithium should be used more widely, given its lower rate of side effects.
The story notes that lithium is documented by other studies to lower the risk of suicide, something that few treatments do in people with bipolar disorders–and a significant advantage given the substantial suicide risk in this group. It also notes that some of the drug’s bad reputation likely stemmed from the higher doses used in decades past and subsequent more side effects.
All in all, the story hit many of the important points in explaining the findings, though we wanted to see some discussion on the limitations of this kind of research, as well as costs of the drugs.

A subset of four VOCs—called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base—have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer “signature” through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.\n\nErin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.\n\nThe researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.\n\n“The rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,” said Dr. Schumer. “This study confirms that the technology is accurate.”\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die—that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.\n\nDr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, “We hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.”\n\nCurrently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. “We hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,” said Dr. van Berkel.\n\nHow the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor’s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n“The great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,” said Dr. van Berkel. “The technology is pretty robust. Our next step is getting approval from the FDA.”\n\n###\n\nSchumer E, Black M, Bousamra M, Trivedi J, Li M, Fu X, van Berkel V.

This release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath — known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease.
The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn’t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is “significant.” The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test’s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs.

Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients\' mobility, they’re only effective within the first few hours of an event.\n\nRecently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients\' motor function.\n\n“What surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,” Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, “While we had hoped for that, we didn’t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there’s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there’s not much more [more] they can recover usually.”\n\nFor the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.\n\nResults showed that the implanted stem cells didn’t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.\n\n“The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. “It wasn’t just someone who couldn’t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].""\n\nThe types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.\n\nIn Steinberg\'s study, it did not “cause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.” And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.\n\nMotor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients’ conditions— an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.\n\nIn addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change “our notion of what happens after a stroke,” Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be “resurrected.”\n\nSource: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

Stroke. 2016.']",This story doesn’t go much beyond the news release that was issued by the medical center behind the study.,"Drawn substantially from a feature-style news release issued by Stanford University’s School of Medicine, this story describes results of a trial in which modified human stem cells were injected into the brains of so-called “chronic” stroke patients.
The results, which study authors called promising, showed the injections were safe. The stem cells–as expected–survived only briefly, but the researchers report that there were “clinically meaningful results” in which some patients (it’s unclear how many) recovered “significant” motor function.
The story states the total number of patients (18), their age range (average age was 61), but it’s missing hard information about the range of specific improvements, along with any interviews from researchers independent of this study or medical center.

This study ""shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else,"" said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial.\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Most people typically receive medication and psychotherapy — but medications don\'t work in all cases and there\'s a shortage of providers in many areas.\n\nAD\n\nLam and his colleagues followed 122 patients and evaluated whether light therapy improved their mood when it was used both with and without fluoxetine, or Prozac, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. Over eight weeks, participants were exposed daily to 30 minutes from a fluorescent light box soon after waking up. Some participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said.\n\nAD\n\nResearchers have two main theories on why light therapy works. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain. There\'s some evidence that depression, like jet lag, occurs when the biological clock is out of sync, and light helps to correct that, Lam said.\n\nLight is also believed to affect neurotransmitters in the brain. Those are considered important for the development of depression and are the targets of most antidepressant medications.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD']","Although this story checked 6 out of 9 of our boxes to earn a 4-star score, the misses were notable because they dealt with benefits, harms, and quality of evidence — all extremely important.","This brief story gives a tantalizing glimpse into a small study of 122 people with major depression, but it leaves us wanting a bit more.
The randomized controlled study divided patients into groups with some receiving light therapy alone, some receiving light and antidepressant, and others received sham therapies imitating light and placebo medication. The most improvement was seen in the groups receiving light alone or light-plus-antidepressant. Paraphrasing the researchers, the story concludes that “enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression.” But the story never really backs up that statement. It doesn’t make the case for why this one rather small study puts the evidence squarely beyond doubt. Nor does it delve very deeply into the study’s limitations.
We would have welcomed more metrics and a clearer explanation for how this one study could change practice going forward.

When patients are in an abnormal irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the LAA, which can then circulate out through the bloodstream and cause stroke. Once the device is in place in the opening of the LAA, a thin layer of tissue grows over it, preventing blood clots from forming in the LAA and therefore preventing stroke.\n\nIt has been suggested that as treatment for atrial fibrillation, the Watchman device may be preferable to standard blood thinning medications, such as warfarin, which raise the risk of bleeding. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the device versus medication, the researchers developed a statistical model based on data from two key research trials, known as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL.\n\nThe researchers found that while results from the trials varied, the device did appear to be more cost-effective in the larger, longer-term trial.

The doctor then attempts to surgically address the knee pain, such as making repairs to a torn meniscus – a C-shaped disc that cushions the knee – or realigning a misaligned patella or kneecap.\n\n“There are some limited circumstances where it’s helpful,” says Dr. Reed Siemieniuk, an internist in Toronto and a doctorate student in health research methodology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. That includes young patients who have sports injuries, or tears in the ligaments of the knee, he says, and patients who have bleeding in the knee – to try to figure out where the bleeding is coming from and address that. The surgery could also benefit individuals of any age who’ve suffered a traumatic injury to the knee, such as a meniscus tear. An example of a good candidate for arthroscopic knee surgery would be a 30-year-old who twists his knee getting up from a seated position or while playing tennis, says Dr. Joseph Bosco, a professor and vice chair of the department of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center.\n\nBut a meta-analysis led by Siemieniuk of research on arthroscopic knee surgery strongly recommended against knee scoping “in nearly all patients with degenerative knee disease.” The clinical practice guideline was published in the BMJ in May. The analysis evaluated arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease, which is often synonymous with knee arthritis. ""It is knee pain or locking that occurs with use or overuse. The most common risk factor is being overweight or obese,"" Siemieniuk explains. ""We use the term degenerative knee disease rather than arthritis because some surgeons restrict the diagnosis of arthritis to those diagnosed by X-ray or MRI when in reality, many people have degenerative knee disease with normal X-rays and MRIs."" Meniscus tears are also a common finding in those with arthritis, or degenerative knee disease, and are not associated with knee symptoms, but are often used as a reason to operate, he adds.\n\n“In all of those groups of patients, arthroscopic surgery … doesn’t have any long-term benefit for pain or for function or quality of life,” Siemieniuk says. “But it does have some downsides [including] two to six weeks recovery time, and some rare but more serious adverse effects like blood clots that can sometimes be fatal [and] infection.”\n\nThe procedure is generally considered safe, but given the lack of evidence demonstrating a long-term benefit in these common scenarios, clinicians and patients should look at other non-surgical options to address knee pain, the researchers assert. The alternatives they cite include losing weight, if a person is overweight, physical therapy, corticoid steroid injections and other types of injections into the joint to treat pain or taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. “Then if it’s severe and it really is interfering with your quality of life and it’s persistent … some people require knee replacement surgery,” Siemieniuk says. “But nowhere along that line should ... arthroscopic surgery, which is even more common, be performed.”\n\nBosco says he generally agrees with the recommendation set forth, and that it doesn’t change the way he practices. But he emphasizes that each patient has to be treated individually. The recommendation suggests similarly that individual factors and patient values and preferences must be taken into account. The expert panel that created the guidelines published in the BMJ included not only doctors but also several patients who had osteoarthritis, including one who’d had arthroscopic knee surgery.\n\n“Our strong recommendation against arthroscopy reflects a low value on a modest probability (less than 15 percent) of small or very small improvement in short-term pain and function that does not persist to one year, and a higher value on avoiding the burden, postoperative limitations and rare serious adverse effects associated with knee arthroscopy,” the researchers wrote. The panel felt that almost all patients would share these values. “The recommendation is not applicable to patients who do not share these values (that is, those who place a high value on a small, uncertain and transient reduction in pain and function, and a low value on avoiding the burden and postoperative limitation associated with arthroscopy),” the researchers added.\n\nBut many arthroscopic surgeries are being done that don’t benefit patients, Siemieniuk stressed. In Ontario, approximately 90 percent of arthroscopic surgeries are performed for degenerative knee disease, he says. Though he adds that it’s difficult to know exactly what proportion of arthroscopic knee surgeries were for degenerative knee disease in the United States, the researchers reported that arthroscopic procedures for degenerative knee disease cost more than $3 billion per year in the U.S. alone, according to previous research. Citing other studies, they report that arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease is the most common orthopedic procedure in countries where data is available and that more than 2 million procedures are done annually worldwide.\n\nDespite the concern that many arthroscopic surgeries are being performed on patients who won’t benefit, some clinicians say these type of guidelines have already been adopted by many surgeons.\n\nThe new recommendation comes as no surprise, says Dr. Alejandro Gonzalez Della Valle, a hip and knee surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. “For a number of years, we have known, that if we offer arthroscopic surgery to patients who have moderate or severe arthritis, they generally don’t do well in the long-term,” he says.\n\nFrequently patients with lots of arthritis in the knee also have torn meniscus. But performing arthroscopic surgery won’t relieve a patient of the discomfort from the underlying arthritis. “Fixing the torn meniscus will not cure the patient’s pain,” he says. “Under those conditions, the surgery will not be useful or effective or will not provide any benefit to the patient.”\n\nOn the other hand, some patients have very minimal arthritis in the knee, and a very severe meniscal tear producing a lot of pain. “In our clinical impression, those patients can do well for several years with arthroscopic surgery,” he says. “So it’s all about patient selection at the end of the day.” For ideal arthroscopic candidates – like those who suffer a traumatic or sports-related meniscal tear, who have no arthritis – arthroscopic surgery can provide a permanent fix.']",The article overall leaves thoughtful readers with a “think twice or thrice” take home message if they are considering arthroscopy.,"This news story uses a recent meta-analysis of already-published research as the news hook to review the pros and cons of arthroscopic knee surgery to treat both acute and chronic knee pain.
The article overall leaves thoughtful readers with a “think twice or thrice” take home message if they are considering arthroscopy, or told by a physician to have it.
The story could have done a better job discussing the evidence for and against this common surgery. It also mostly misses emphasizing a key point in the published research that for the vast majority of patients who undergo arthroscopy when they have both degenerative disease and tears in the knee’s cushioning tissue, exercise works just as well.

And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.\n\nOne long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.\n\n“Sauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,” says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.\n\nIn a recent editorial appearing in the Netherlands Heart Journal, van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. “Death in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,” he writes.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nStill, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing’s safety have always centered on its occupant’s (and her heart’s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.\n\nInfrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.\n\n“As infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,” says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.\n\nWhile there’s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there’s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.\n\nPeople who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a “room-temperature” space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart’s vessels.\n\nBeever’s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas—including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.\n\nBeever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing—infrared or otherwise.\n\nGet The Brief.

(For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don’t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there’s no data on those risks.)\n\nSo what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don’t seem to be any significant health risks.\n\nAsk your doctor first. But if you’re wondering whether an infrared sauna is worth a try, the evidence suggests you have little to lose and possibly something to gain by checking one out.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","Are infrared saunas healthy?

Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk\'s tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.\n\nConservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don\'t respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.\n\nAn alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.\n\n""Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,"" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nDr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.\n\nFor comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.\n\nThe one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.\n\n""Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,"" Dr. Napoli said.\n\nThe results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.\n\nThe use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.\n\n""We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.""\n\nToday, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.\n\n""Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.""\n\nCo-authors are Roberto Scipione, M.D., Fabrizio Andrani, M.D., Susan Dababou, Cristina Marrocchio, Michele Anzidei, M.D., and Carlo Catalano, M.D.\n\n###\n\nNote: Copies of RSNA 2018 news releases and electronic images will be available online at RSNA.org/press18 beginning Monday, Nov. 26.\n\nRSNA is an association of over 54,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, medical physicists and related scientists, promoting excellence in patient care and health care delivery through education, research and technologic innovation.

The touted benefits of pRF (pulsed energy applied to nerve roots of the spine by a probe) noted in this study are based on difficult-to-reproduce patient questionnaires, and framed with language that makes it very difficult for readers to place in an understandable context.

It's great for your microbiome","['Scientists have some great news for those who love coffee, tea and wine: Drinking any of these beverages is associated with a healthier and more diverse community of microbes living in the gut.\n\nThe opposite is true for consuming sugary drinks and whole milk, as well as for eating a lot of carbohydrates and indulging in frequent snacks, researchers reported this week in the journal Science.\n\nIn other words, when it comes to the makeup of your gut microbiome, you are what you eat -- and drink.\n\n“In total we found 60 dietary factors that influence diversity,” said Dr. Alexandra Zhernakova, a researcher at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the first author of the study, in a statement. “But there is good correlation between diversity and health: greater diversity is better.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour microbiome is the community of mostly beneficial bacteria, fungi and viruses that live on and in your body. These microscopic organisms earn their keep by helping you process food and regulating your immune system. Experts believe that the makeup of a person’s microbial community can also play a role in mood disorders, obesity and other diseases including irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nBut the study of the microbiome is relatively new, and scientists are still working out exactly what a healthy microbiome looks like.\n\nZhernakova and her colleagues helped fill in that picture by analyzing the microbes inside the guts of more than 1,100 people. They identified 126 factors that were correlated with changes in the makeup of an individual’s microbial community. These include 60 related to diet, 12 associated with diseases, 19 linked with drugs and four tied to smoking.\n\n“To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess such a broad range of host and environmental factors in relation to gut microbiome and at such a large scale,” said Jingyuan Fu, a systems geneticist at the University of Groningen who worked with Zhernakova.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers analyzed stool samples of 1,135 Dutch participants in the Lifelines-DEEP study. The participants collected their own stool samples at home and then immediately put them in the freezer.\n\nNo more than a few days later, the samples were transported to labs at the university, where they remained frozen until they were processed by researchers. This ensured that none of the bacteria had a chance to grow or change from the time the sample was collected. Also, it guaranteed that all samples were treated the same way.\n\n“In situations where samples are sent by post at room temperature, the time of the delivery for every sample is different,” she said. “That situation can lead to the growth of bacteria during transportation and adds additional ‘noise’ to the findings.”\n\nAfter analyzing the samples and comparing them with other data collected in the Lifelines-DEEP study, the scientists found that consuming fruits, vegetables and yogurt positively influenced microbial diversity in the gut. So did drinking tea, wine, coffee and buttermilk.\n\nOn the flip side, sugary sodas and savory snacks were associated with lower levels of diversity. So was having irritable bowel syndrome and smoking during pregnancy.\n\nWomen tend to have more microbial diversity than men, and older people have greater microbial diversity than younger people, the researchers found.\n\nThe study does not address exactly why certain foods and behaviors influence the mix of microbes that populate a person’s gut. However, the researchers report that people who eat a lot of yogurt and buttermilk had higher levels of the bacteria that are used in the making of those foods in their guts.\n\n”For more complex food, such as fruits and vegetables, we don’t know the answer,” Fu said. “We can suggest that changes in fiber content and carbohydrate composition are playing a role, but this should be studied in detail in respect to every food item.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFu also outlined many areas of research that the group hopes to tackle next. She said they are hoping to expand the study to 10,000 participants and follow them over time. They also want to collect samples from the nose and throat.\n\nIn a related study, researchers combed through thousands of human fecal samples to create a catalog of the microorganisms that colonize the human digestive system. They identified species of microorganisms from at least 664 different genera in the guts of close to 4,000 adults from the U.S., the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nWhen they expanded their collection of stool samples to include a small number of people from Papua New Guinea, Peru and Tanzania, the researchers detected a core group of 14 genera of microbes that were just about universally present.\n\nThese 14 genera were common to 95% of the humans sampled, and the species within these groups accounted for about 72% of their total gut microbiome. The main difference between individual people was the relative abundance of microbes from these core groups, including species from the Ruminococcaceae family and from the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella.\n\nThe researchers found several links between the diversity of gut flora and various aspects of biological function. For instance, people who reported looser stools were more likely to have a rich garden of microflora than those whose stools were harder and dryer.\n\nThe researchers also found significant associations between people’s genus abundance and their hip circumference, history of taking the antibiotic amoxicillin, uric acid concentrations (a factor in gout) and their preference for eating dark chocolate.\n\nMore than any single factor, the use of a wide range of drugs influenced microbiome variation among the people in this study. The clearest patterns emerged in those who had a recent history of taking antibiotics, osmotic laxatives, medications for inflammatory bowel disease, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistamines or hormones used for birth control or to alleviate symptoms of menopause.\n\nBut contrary to some expectations, the data did not show that the abundance of microbes in the adult gut was influenced by whether the person was born in a vaginal delivery or by C-section. Nor did researchers find any evidence that those who were breast-fed as babies had more diverse microbiomes when they grew up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, both studies underscore that a healthy microbiome is a key component of a healthy body, even if scientists are still working to understand exactly how each influences the other.\n\nThe day may come when patients routinely provide doctors with stool samples to help better understand their health, Fu said.\n\n“It is becoming more and more clear that the gut microbiome serves as a sort of fingerprint that captures all kinds of signals about host health,” she said.\n\nDo you love science?

The study, published this month in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics. The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors.\n\nAcne is one of the most common diseases in the world. It affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18, but it also regularly impacts adults. More than 50 percent of women in the United States are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29, while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39.\n\nOral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne, and when combined with the large patient population, the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties, according to the Centers for Disease Control - a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine.\n\n""It\'s clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit, and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative,"" said the study\'s lead author John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA, Dermatology chief resident at Penn. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study\'s senior author.\n\nSpironolactone, marketed under the name aldactone, is currently approved to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and conditions that cause people to retain fluid. It blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen, meaning it\'s not an option to treat acne in men. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. As a result, some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients.\n\nResearchers compared data on 6,684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31,614 who were prescribed antibiotics. Within a year, 14.4 percent of spironolactone patients and 13.4 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments, suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate, despite the fact that tetracycline-class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently.\n\n""These numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne,"" Barbieri said.\n\nIn addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.\n\n""This indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics, which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option,"" Barbieri said. He also noted spironolactone is less expensive, which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured.\n\nSpironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration despite expert opinion supporting its use, and Barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.\n\n###\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world\'s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care. Penn Medicine consists of the Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (founded in 1765 as the nation\'s first medical school) and the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which together form a $7.8 billion enterprise.\n\nThe Perelman School of Medicine has been ranked among the top medical schools in the United States for more than 20 years, according to U.S. News & World Report\'s survey of research-oriented medical schools. The School is consistently among the nation\'s top recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health, with $405 million awarded in the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System\'s patient care facilities include: The Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center -- which are recognized as one of the nation\'s top ""Honor Roll"" hospitals by U.S. News & World Report -- Chester County Hospital; Lancaster General Health; Penn Medicine Princeton Health; Penn Wissahickon Hospice; and Pennsylvania Hospital -- the nation\'s first hospital, founded in 1751. Additional affiliated inpatient care facilities and services throughout the Philadelphia region include Good Shepherd Penn Partners, a partnership between Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network and Penn Medicine, and Princeton House Behavioral Health, a leading provider of highly skilled and compassionate behavioral healthcare.\n\nPenn Medicine is committed to improving lives and health through a variety of community-based programs and activities. In fiscal year 2017, Penn Medicine provided more than $500 million to benefit our community.']","This release calling on dermatologists to prescribe spironolactone as an alternative to oral antibiotics for acne treatment is missing several key pieces of information including evidence, benefits, cost and potential harms.","Researchers at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania compared about 38,000 records from women treated for acne with two different drugs. They found those who used the diuretic drug spironolactone switched to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who began with antibiotics. Authors of the study viewed the prescription change as a proxy for ineffectiveness, and suggest that switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy or other factors.
The release sends a mixed message. It calls twice for a change in prescribing practices but then states that “the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.”
Another problem with the release is that it doesn’t discuss any of the harms associated with spironolactone.

The Guardian appears to lean heavily on an Imperial College press release that trumpets the benefits of taking statin drugs, which can lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol — and reduce the risk of deadly heart disease. It claims the study showed statins reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 28%.
But that’s a lopsided and potentially misleading way to present the data. When broken down into absolute numbers, the benefits are far less dramatic (see quantified benefits criterion, below). In that light, the advantages compared to the disadvantages of taking statins for many years — risk of muscle pain, liver damage, diabetes, and more — become less clear.
The story also misses a very big red flag when it comes to making clear that most of the authors have a financial relationship with the primary funder of the study: a drug company that makes statins.

It measures CRP in milligrams per liter of blood: less than 1.0 mg/l is considered low risk; 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l is average risk; and greater than 3.0 mg/l is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology both have endorsed the use of hs-CRP for ""intermediate risk"" individuals. And one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late 50s and early 60s should have the test.\n\nWhile inflammation is the body\'s natural response to a variety of physical states, including fever, injury and infection, research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack, sudden death and stroke, Dr. Cho notes.\n\nThose who smoke, have high blood pressure, and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of CRP—and those who are thin and fit have lower levels. But genetic factors can also contribute to elevated CRP in people without traditional risk factors.\n\nResearch shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. A 1997 study of healthy physicians, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated CRP levels. And the Harvard Women\'s Health Study, which looked at 12 different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women, found that after three years CRP was the strongest predictor of risk.\n\nNot-So-Low Risk\n\nWhile some experts don\'t think the hs-CRP test adds much to current cardiovascular risk-prediction strategies, others say a large study known as the Jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble—and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs. The 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of LDL—the bad cholesterol—but high hs-CRP levels, the statin Crestor reduced the risk of heart-related death, heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44% compared with those given placebos.\n\nPaul Ridker, a Harvard University researcher who led the Jupiter study, says, ""We know that those with elevated hs-CRP are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low, and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group."" While the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol, Dr. Ridker says ""the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk.""\n\nHis team has now launched two major clinical trials—one funded by the federal government and one by industry—to address that question. (Dr. Ridker is co-inventor on patents held by Brigham and Women\'s Hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hs-CRP in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.)\n\nSomething to Talk About\n\nDr. Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment.\n\n""If you are 53 and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your CRP is normal, I\'m not sure I would throw the whole kitchen sink at you,"" says Dr. Cho. ""But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results"" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise.\n\nMs. Walters didn\'t have high levels when she was first tested, but they began to rise in later screenings. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. She also joined Weight Watchers to drop a few pounds and runs with friends for exercise.\n\nA former teacher who is now a stay-at-home mom, Ms. Walters says, ""I have a little girl, and I plan to be here for everything.""\n\nMs. Landro is an assistant managing editor for The Wall Street Journal and writes the paper\'s Informed Patient column.

However, its use is being researched for a number of conditions, including epilepsy, depression and bipolar disorder. Francisco Ponce, MD, Director of the Barrow Center for Neuromodulation, believes there are potential applications for Alzheimer\'s disease - the most common form of dementia - as well. Whereas in Parkinson\'s disease and essential tremor, the target for the electrodes are nodes within the motor circuits, the Alzheimer\'s study targeted the fornix, which is part of the memory pathway.\n\n""There are more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer\'s, and yet there are few promising pharmacologic treatment options for this progressive disease,"" says Dr. Ponce.

While the study was relatively small, we believe the data suggest that DBS surgery targeting the fornix can be performed safely in this patient population. The hope is that our positive surgical experience will help pave the way for future research into DBS and Alzheimer\'s,"" says Dr. Ponce.\n\nDr. Ponce adds that the next step is evaluating the efficacy and longer-term safety of the treatment, which will not be known until the last patient completes the two-year evaluation later this year.\n\n###']",This release contains a disappointing omission of serious side effects that required patients to have corrective surgery.,"Illustration: Deep brain stimulation electrode placement.

In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights’ sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.\n\nAfter sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.\n\n“We experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,” said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.\n\n“Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email.\n\n“Bright light is alerting,” Mistlberger said.\n\nSleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.\n\nShift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.\n\nFor the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.\n\nThey found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.\n\nExposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.\n\nBeyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.\n\n“There is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,” said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“That said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,” Griffin added by email.\n\nThe proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“Drowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,” Winston said by email.\n\nMore research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nBut there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.\n\n“Safety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,” Redelmeier said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2ghLalo Sleep Medicine, online November 16, 2016.']","Ample independent researchers were included, and the measured benefits of the intervention are stated clearly.","The U.

Patients are prone to infections and progressively lose the ability to breathe.\n\nUntil Tuesday\'s approval of Kalydeco, the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. and 100,000 world-wide could take medicines that only tackled the symptoms of the disease, such as antibiotics to treat the infections. Patients typically spent a few hours each day wearing vibrating vests to dislodge mucus build-up.\n\nThe medicine is a pill meant to be taken twice daily with fat-containing food. It was approved to treat patients who have a mutation in a gene that causes cystic fibrosis in about 4% of CF patients, some 1,200 people in the U.S.\n\nThe mutation, called G551D, is in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The CFTR gene regulates the transport of chloride and water in the body. Kalydeco helps the protein made by the CFTR gene function better, which improves lung function and improves other side effects of cystic fibrosis.\n\n""Now I\'m nervous about growing old,"" said Emily Schaller, a 29-year-old from Trenton, Mich., who has been taking the pills as part of clinical trials since late 2009 and has since run five half-marathons. ""I\'ve never been more hopeful.""\n\nKalydeco comes with one of the most expensive price tags for a medicine, according to Lawrence Marsh, a Barclays Capital analyst. He said more expensive drugs include Soliris, which treats a blood disorder and costs $409,500 a year, and Elaprase, which treats a potentially fatal condition that causes mental retardation and costs $375,000 a year.\n\nLike Kalydeco, these drugs tend to provide significant improvements for a small number of patients.

But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree\n\nMike Albans / NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images PSA blood testing at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nIf you’re wondering why experts still can’t agree on prostate-cancer screening, you’re not alone.\n\nJust two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal.\n\n“Almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,” urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study.\n\nThe new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely.\n\n(MORE: Men Should Forgo PSA Testing, U.S. Panel Advises)\n\nNo one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits.\n\nOn the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years.\n\nStill, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it — surgery, radiation, as well as other options — also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that’s too much risky treatment to justify the results.\n\nSo when the government advisory panel — the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — recommends against routine PSA testing, it’s making a judgment call. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all.\n\n(MORE: Surgery for Early Prostate Cancer Doesn’t Save Lives)\n\nAs for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren’t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we’d get without screening, the study takes today’s population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced — that is, the rates way back in 1983-85.\n\nIn other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the ’80s; it finds we’d have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we’d get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that’s not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s.\n\nOne further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers — but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process. That’s what experts can’t agree about.\n\nMany doctors do have very strong opinions, though. As a patient, if you’re deciding whether to get a PSA test, or whether not to get a PSA test, remember you do have a right to your own opinion too. There’s no easy answer.\n\nMORE: Prostate Cancer Screening: What You Need to Know""]",Too little time spent on the weaknesses of a statistical modeling study.  Independent expert analysis would have helped.,"The thoughtful, conversational tone of this piece helped readers start to sort through the evidence for and against PSA screening, but, unfortunately, it left readers with the impression that this new study was bringing a lot of new evidence to the table. It should have brought in some independent voices to help readers understand the significant weaknesses of this retrospective study – weaknesses that were better described in the WebMD story.  It also fell short in describing the potential harms of treatment as “small.”  We don’t think most men would view the chance of risk as small if given the numbers.

These include physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, and the work of anthropologist Noelle Perez-Christiaens.\n\nBack pain is a tricky beast. Most Americans will at some point have a problem with their backs. And for an unlucky third, treatments won\'t work, and the problem will become chronic.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Esther Gokhale/Gerard Mackworth-Young Courtesy of Esther Gokhale/Gerard Mackworth-Young\n\nBelieve it or not, there are a few cultures in the world where back pain hardly exists. One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs showed little signs of degeneration as people aged.\n\nAn acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain — how they stand, sit and walk. Now she\'s sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.\n\nAbout two decades ago, Esther Gokhale started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. ""I had excruciating pain. I couldn\'t sleep at night,"" she says. ""I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled.""\n\nGokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. ""They wanted to do another back surgery. You don\'t want to make a habit out of back surgery,"" she says.\n\nThis time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn\'t convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: ""Go to populations where they don\'t have these huge problems and see what they\'re doing.""\n\nEsther Gokhale\'s Five Tips For Better Posture And Less Back Pain Try these exercises while you\'re working at your desk, sitting at the dinner table or walking around, Esther Gokhale recommends. 1. Do a shoulder roll: Americans tend to scrunch their shoulders forward, so our arms are in front of our bodies. That\'s not how people in indigenous cultures carry their arms, Gokhale says. To fix that, gently pull your shoulders up, push them back and then let them drop — like a shoulder roll. Now your arms should dangle by your side, with your thumbs pointing out. ""This is the way all your ancestors parked their shoulders,"" she says. ""This is the natural architecture for our species."" 2. Lengthen your spine: Adding extra length to your spine is easy, Gokhale says. Being careful not to arch your back, take a deep breath in and grow tall. Then maintain that height as you exhale. Repeat: Breathe in, grow even taller and maintain that new height as you exhale. ""It takes some effort, but it really strengthens your abdominal muscles,"" Gokhale says. 3. Squeeze, squeeze your glute muscles when you walk: In many indigenous cultures, people squeeze their gluteus medius muscles every time they take a step. That\'s one reason they have such shapely buttocks muscles that support their lower backs. Gokhale says you can start developing the same type of derrière by tightening the buttocks muscles when you take each step. ""The gluteus medius is the one you\'re after here. It\'s the one high up on your bum,"" Gokhale says. ""It\'s the muscle that keeps you perky, at any age."" 4. Don\'t put your chin up: Instead, add length to your neck by taking a lightweight object, like a bean bag or folded washcloth, and balance it on the top of your crown. Try to push your head against the object. ""This will lengthen the back of your neck and allow your chin to angle down — not in an exaggerated way, but in a relaxed manner,"" Gokhale says. 5. Don\'t sit up straight! ""That\'s just arching your back and getting you into all sorts of trouble,"" Gokhale says. Instead do a shoulder roll to open up the chest and take a deep breath to stretch and lengthen the spine.\n\n[Added June 10] So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as Noelle Perez-Christiaens, who analyzed postures of indigenous populations. And she studied physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method.\n\nAnd the original post continues ...\n\nThen over the next decade, Gokhale went to cultures around the world that live far away from modern life. She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.\n\n""I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin — they\'d never seen a white person before,"" she says.\n\nGokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.\n\n""I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts,"" Gokhale says. ""They\'re quite old. But the truth is they don\'t have a back pain.""\n\nShe tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. ""They have this regal posture, and it\'s very compelling.""\n\nAnd it\'s quite different than American spines.\n\nIf you look at an American\'s spine from the side, or profile, it\'s shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.\n\nBut Gokhale didn\'t see those two big curves in people who don\'t have back pain. ""That S shape is actually not natural,"" she says. ""It\'s a J-shaped spine that you want.""\n\nIn fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci — or a Gray\'s Anatomy book from 1901 — the spine isn\'t shaped like a sharp, curvy S. It\'s much flatter, all the way down the back. Then at the bottom, it curves to stick the buttocks out. So the spine looks more like the letter J.\n\n""The J-shaped spine is what you see in Greek statues. It\'s what you see in young children. It\'s good design,"" Gokhale says.\n\nSo Gokhale worked to get her spine into the J shape. And gradually her back pain went away.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Library of Congress Library of Congress\n\nThen Gokhale realized she could help others. She developed a set of exercises, wrote a book and set up a studio in downtown Palo Alto.\n\nNow her list of clients is impressive. She\'s helped YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report. She has given classes at Google, Facebook and companies across the country. In Silicon Valley, she\'s known as the ""posture guru.""\n\nEach year, doctors in the Bay Area refer hundreds of patients to Gokhale. One of them is Dr. Neeta Jain, an internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. She puts Gokhale\'s method in the same category as Pilates and yoga for back pain. And it doesn\'t bother her that the method hasn\'t been tested in a clinical trial.\n\n""If people are finding things that are helpful, and it\'s not causing any harm, then why do we have to wait for a trial?"" Jain asked.\n\nBut there\'s still a big question looming here: Is Gokhale right? Have people in Western cultures somehow forgotten the right way to stand?\n\nScientists don\'t know yet, says Dr. Praveen Mummaneni, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco\'s Spine Center. Nobody has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain, he says. Nobody has even documented the shape of their spines.\n\n""I\'d like to go and take X-rays of indigenous populations and compare it to people in the Western world,"" Mummaneni says. ""I think that would be helpful.""\n\nBut there\'s a whole bunch of reasons why Americans\' postures — and the shape of their spines — may be different than those of indigenous populations, he says. For starters, Americans tend to be much heavier.\n\n""If you have a lot of fat built up in the belly, that could pull your weight forward,"" Mummaneni says. ""That could curve the spine. And people who are thinner probably have less curvature"" — and thus a spine shaped more like J than than an S.\n\nAmericans are also much less active than people in traditional cultures, Mummaneni says. ""I think the sedentary lifestyle promotes a lack of muscle tone and a lack of postural stability because the muscles get weak.""\n\ntoggle caption NPR\n\nEveryone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale\'s success.\n\nIn other words, it\'s not that the J-shaped spine is the ideal one — or the healthiest. It\'s what goes into making the J-shaped spine that matters: ""You have to use muscle strength to get your spine to look like a J shape,"" he says.\n\nSo Gokhale has somehow figured out a way to teach people to build up their core muscles without them even knowing it. ""Yes, I think that\'s correct,"" Mummaneni says. ""You\'re not going to be able to go from the S- to the J-shaped spine without having good core muscle strength. And I think that\'s key here.""\n\nSo indigenous people around the world don\'t have a magic bullet for stopping back pain. They\'ve just got beefy abdominal muscles, and their lifestyle helps to keep them that way, even as they age.']",This story about the “Gokhale Method” for reducing back pain delivers the right bottom-line message but could’ve done so much sooner in the story.,"Will adopting the posture of indigenous peoples help reduce rates of lower back pain?
The story discusses a technique called the “Gokhale Method” for reducing back pain by focusing on exercises that can help to improve posture. It’s clear that a lot of reporting went into the piece. And the story does a good job of highlighting that building up “core” strength in the abdomen is important for limiting or preventing back pain, regardless of whether one uses the Gokhale Method. However, the story seems to dismiss causes of back pain that aren’t related to muscle strength, and it doesn’t address cost at all. Also, while the story does eventually warn us that there’s little if any hard evidence to support the Gokhale approach, we have to wade more than halfway through the 1,200-word story before the first caveat is introduced. Such an important qualifier should be delivered sooner.

Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nTreating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so ""having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,"" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P. Peters, a professor of pulmonary, critical care, allergy, and immunologic medicine at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, NC.\n\n""People are different. Some people will respond to some medications, some respond to others,"" he said.\n\nThe report, funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is published in the Sept. 19 online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal is releasing the data early to coincide with its presentation Sunday at the European Respiratory Society meeting in Barcelona.\n\nFor the study, Peters\' team tried three drug regimens on 210 asthmatics. These included: Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid; a double dose of the inhaled steroid; and an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, a long-acting beta agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airway.\n\nPatients stayed on each regiment for 14 weeks.\n\nThe researchers found that Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid was more effective than giving a double dose of steroids in improving breathing and controlling asthma for these tough-to-treat patients.\n\nIn addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said.\n\nThat\'s important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted.\n\nThe results need to be confirmed in a much larger pool of patients, Peters said, and he noted that the patients were not followed long enough to see if Spiriva was able to reduce the severity of asthma attacks and hospitalizations.\n\nIn addition, Spiriva\'s safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said.\n\nBecause the drug is not yet FDA-approved for use in asthma, Peters was reluctant to recommend it for that use. ""My hope is that in three to five years we will have the drug approved for asthma,"" he said.\n\nDr. Shirin Shafazand, an assistant professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that ""perhaps there is a role for Spiriva in these poorly controlled asthmatics.""\n\nHowever, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn\'t be used in asthma, she said.\n\n""This is a good foundation to design a trial where you would look at Spiriva plus steroids versus doubling the dose of steroids in a large number of asthmatics who are poorly controlled and then you follow them long-term,"" Shafazand said, but right now there is no data on long-term efficacy and safety.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on asthma, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Slightly better than the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3167"" target=""_blank"">AP story</a> – mainly because of the way it emphasized the caveats about this research. </span>","Each tells the tale differently, with different context and subplots.

Of this group, 58 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 24 with bladder cancer and 73 with haematuria or poor stream without cancer. The results of the pilot study using the GC sensor system indicate that it is able to successfully identify different patterns of volatile compounds that allow classification of urine samples from patients with urological cancers.\n\nUrgent need for earlier diagnosis\n\nProfessor Chris Probert from the University of Liverpool\'s Institute of Translational Medicine began work on this project with UWE Bristol when he was working in Bristol as a gastroenterologist with clinical and research interest in inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe research team used a gas chromatography sensor system called Odoreader that was developed by a team led by Professor Probert and Professor Norman Ratcliffe at UWE Bristol. The test involves inserting urine samples into the Odoreader that are then measured using algorithms developed by the research team at the University of Liverpool and UWE Bristol.\n\nProfessor Probert said: ""There is an urgent need to identify these cancers at an earlier stage when they are more treatable as the earlier a person is diagnosed the better. After further sample testing the next step is to take this technology and put it into a user friendly format. With help from industry partners we will be able to further develop the Odoreader, which will enable it to be used where it is needed most; at a patient\'s bedside, in a doctor\'s surgery, in a clinic or Walk In Centre, providing fast, inexpensive, accurate results.""\n\nLike an electronic nose\n\nProfessor Norman Ratcliffe said, ""There is currently no accurate test for prostate cancer, the vagaries of the PSA test indicators can sometimes result in unnecessary biopsies, resulting in psychological toll, risk of infection from the procedure and even sometimes missing cancer cases. Our aim is to create a test that avoids this procedure at initial diagnosis by detecting cancer in a non-invasive way by smelling the disease in men\'s urine. A few years ago we did similar work to detect bladder cancer following a discovery that dogs could sniff out cancer. We have been using the Odoreader, which is like an electronic nose to sense the cancer.""\n\n""The Odoreader has a 30 metre column that enables the compounds in the urine to travel through at different rates thus breaking the sample into a readable format. This is then translated into an algorithm enabling detection of cancer by reading the patterns presented. The positioning of the prostate gland which is very close to the bladder gives the urine profile a different algorithm if the man has cancer.""\n\nMr Raj Prasad, Consultant Urologist at Southmead Hospital, North Bristol NHS Trust, said: ""If this test succeeds at full medical trial it will revolutionise diagnostics. Even with detailed template biopsies there is a risk that we may fail to detect prostate cancer in some cases. Currently indicators such as diagnosed prostatomegaly (enlarged prostate) and unusually high PSA levels can lead to recommendations for biopsy if there is a concern that cancer may be prevalent. An accurate urine test would mean that many men who currently undergo prostate biopsy may not need to do so.""\n\n###\n\nThe pilot trial was funded by the Rotary Club in Bristol who held annual Run for the Future events in Bristol.\n\nThe research team is now looking to fund a full clinical trial.\n\nA video in which Professor Probert explains how the machine works can be found here']",This news release about a sniff test for prostate cancer inflates preliminary findings.,"News video screen grab: Prostate cancer screening sensor developed at the University of Liverpool
This news release summarizes findings from a pilot study on a device that would screen for prostate cancer in men by “smelling” urine samples. The device employs gas chromotography, which separates and detects the presence of certain compounds in the urine, along with computer algorithms. The pilot study of 155 patients included those already diagnosed with prostate, bladder, haematuria or poor stream but without the presence of cancer. The researchers claim the device, which is still under development, accurately identified urological cancers from the samples. The release would have been improved had it given more attention to the device’s benefits and evidence found in the study and placed less emphasis on the “urgency” of early diagnosis.

Tesone, who is now 42, was diagnosed with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy which is a genetic disease that rapidly clouds a patient’s central vision.\n\nTesone, whose brother has the condition as well, told FoxNews.com that she sees “through a dense fog.”\n\n“It’s not as though there is a big black spot. Your peripheral vision begins to take over,” she said, adding, “I get a whole image of a whole room, for example, but what I don’t have is clarity.”\n\nTesone didn’t allow the diagnosis to alter her life plans, and though she was saddened by the news, she was determined to live a successful and fulfilling life.\n\n“You have to decide what accommodations you’re going to make for yourself in your home life and work life and figure them out,” she said.\n\nTesone began to utilize different tools, from talking computers to magnifiers that project images on to a large screen. These large and bulky gadgets served as a modest improvement to her life but it was her husband who found an item that she said makes her life much more efficient.\n\nHer husband, a computer programmer, was attending a conference and heard about a device called the OrCam, which helps those who are visually impaired. He was able to get one for his wife so she can be part of the beta testing.\n\n“OrCam is a portable intuitive smart camera that someone wears on their glasses,” Bryan Wolynski, an optometrist who promotes OrCam to doctors and trains patients on how to use the device, told FoxNews.com.\n\n“It fits on their own right side temple of their glasses, takes a picture and then speaks to the wearer what it sees,” he said.\n\nThe camera, which is about the size of a lighter, is connected by a wire to a power pack that can fit in a pocket or purse. It is activated when a patient points at a subject, or presses a button on the power pack. The camera takes a picture and instantaneously reads what it sees. OrCam can read print on a newspaper or a piece of mail. It also can be trained to recognize a person’s face or any household object.\n\nOrCam costs $3,500, but Wolynski believes the outcome worth the price.\n\n“I have seen a person cry when being able to read for the first time in many years,” he said.\n\nAnother ophthalmologist, Dr. Marc Werner, also believes that OrCam is a useful device, but he said there are some drawbacks.\n\n“It doesn’t always get every word exactly correctly, so if you’re reading a long book, it may not be the best way to do it,” he said, adding “but certainly there is nothing out there as far as I know that lets you read a newspaper or get the gist of the story even if it’s going to miss a few words or a few concepts, it’s still far better than what’s out there right now.”\n\nTesone agrees because of how much more efficient her life is now, both at work and at home. Reading one piece of paper on a magnifier could take her sometimes up to 20 minutes because she almost had to read letter by letter. Now, the OrCam takes about 30 seconds to read, scan and dictate the letter back to her.\n\n“I have time at home with my children because I could just read something and be done. It’s just so amazing to be able to do,” Tesone said.\n\nFor more information about OrCam click here.']",This story is based almost entirely on one woman’s experience with the product being profiled. We don’t think that’s thorough enough.,"The OrCam device
This story is basically a testimonial about a math teacher whose medical condition — Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy — left her with impaired vision.  The teacher was able to use a new product, a camera that fits beside the wearer’s glasses and “reads” to the wearer, restoring at least in part her ability to “see.”
Unfortunately, a description of one woman’s very positive experience with this device isn’t going to give readers the full story here. There’s no discussion of evidence (it’s unclear if there is, in fact, any evidence on this device), and the benefits described by the woman in the story may not be representative of broader experience with it.

But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits.\n\nSince then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective.\n\nIn the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day.\n\nThe number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day. Lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed.\n\nThe hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo.\n\nAlthough the benefit was modest, it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it, the researchers said. The study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes. African-American women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes. The study found none.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">A serviceable job of explaining what happened in a study.

Each machine costs as much as $300,000. Some of the hospitals are aggressively promoting the device in ads and media presentations. One radio ad by the University of Miami\'s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center says NanoKnife offers ""real hope"" to patients with liver, lung or kidney cancer with ""almost no side effects.""\n\nThe NanoKnife has been tested on animals and a small number of human patients, says its manufacturer, AngioDynamics Inc. ANGO -0.63% of Queensbury, N.Y. ""We have not done randomized, controlled clinical trials, the so-called gold-standard studies,"" says company chief executive Jan Keltjens. ""We think this is a very promising technology for treating cancer that is otherwise untreatable.""\n\nRegarding the hospitals\' ads, Mr. Keltjens says, ""We are not part of the whole PR machine. It\'s not something we are happy about."" He declined to elaborate.\n\nThe NanoKnife, which is also available in five hospitals outside the U.S., has so far been used to treat about 300 cancer patients world-wide. Doctors who have used the device say it has saved lives, including among prostate-cancer patients. While complications from the treatment have been reported in a few patients, some doctors say they are mainly concerned about what isn\'t known about the device because of a lack of evidence.\n\nHospitals in the U.S. and overseas are touting a new tumor-zapping medical device for cancer patients called the NanoKnife. The device uses jolts of electricity to remove cancerous tumors, but it\'s effectiveness has never really been proven, WSJ\'s Tom Burton reports.\n\n""There is growing concern in the interventional oncology community [that the NanoKnife] is being widely adopted prior to having gone through the necessary rigors of controlled investigations and clinical trials,"" says Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Chicago\'s Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Northwestern doesn\'t have a NanoKnife, he says.\n\nThe NanoKnife\'s journey from testing in animals to being promoted as a cancer fighter highlights a shortcut the Food and Drug Administration allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices. When a device is deemed similar enough to another already on the market, it can get approved with little or no clinical evidence.\n\nThe shortcut has been around since 1976 when Congress enacted it to encourage innovation in the industry and to get improved products quickly to market. But in an August report, an FDA panel recommended that the regulation be tightened by requiring manufacturers to provide more safety data on new devices and more detail about the connection between new and previously approved devices. Manufacturers were given 60 days to comment.\n\nPride of Ownership Doctors who own their own CT and MRI machines tend to order more scans for patients than doctors who don\'t own such equipment, which can drive up the cost of care. Some examples of how much more Medicare paid for scans to doctors who own their own imaging machines: Condition Additional cost of imaging Strokes 55% higher Spine trauma 53% higher Congestive heart failure 104% higher Minor back disorders 59% higher Source: Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2009 Report to Congress, based on Medicare data\n\nSome products have had problems once on the market after receiving expedited FDA approval. Bausch & Lomb Inc.\'s contact-lens solution Renu with MoistureLoc was removed from the world market in 2006 after being linked to cases of fungal eye infection that can cause blindness. And Medtronic Inc.\'s Sprint Fidelis defibrillator wires were pulled from the market in 2007 after being linked to deaths. Bausch & Lomb had won regulatory approval through the same shortcut that applied to NanoKnife, while Medtronic benefited from a different but similar FDA provision allowing marketing without large clinical studies.\n\nAdvaMed, the medical-device industry association, says products approved through FDA shortcuts ""have an extremely good overall record"" of safety, and that any regulatory changes ""should be directed toward device types where there have been demonstrated issues.""\n\nThe NanoKnife was approved in 2008 because it was shown capable of destroying tissue similar to other existing devices that are used in heart surgery. But the NanoKnife, which isn\'t really a knife, was put to work treating cancer, excising malignant tumors that are near arteries, airways or other vulnerable tissues and thus difficult to remove.\n\nThe device, about the size of a small refrigerator, is connected to disposable electrode needles that are inserted into the tumor. Powerful electrical jolts fire from one needle to the other, creating microscopic holes in the cell membranes of cancer cells that are meant to destroy the tumor.\n\nMedicare doesn\'t specifically pay for use of the NanoKnife, though hospitals and doctors get reimbursement under more general medical-treatment billing codes. Some private insurers, including Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, decline to cover its use because of the lack of ""scientific evidence of effectiveness in improving health outcomes.""\n\nGary Onik, a retired interventional radiologist and the NanoKnife\'s inventor, says he has treated about 30 patients with the device and the result ""was phenomenal."" All but two of the patients were cancer-free two years after the procedure, he says.\n\nAt medical conferences in the U.S. and Europe, some doctors have given similar anecdotal evidence that the NanoKnife has enabled them to treat otherwise untreatable tumors.\n\nSome side effects have been reported. Because the device uses large electrical bursts, it can trigger fast heartbeats. Four such cases out of about three dozen patients were described in a recent report by Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Melbourne, Australia. AngioDynamics says that these cases have all been treatable and that the company has taken technical steps to minimize such future occurrences.\n\nOne case reported to the FDA was of a U.S. patient who in July suffered a serious hemothorax, or blood buildup between the chest wall and lungs. The patient had to stay in the hospital for 16 days, and doctors said an artery ""most likely"" was punctured during the operation. AngioDynamics said in the FDA report that such a puncture is a ""possible complication"" of any such operation.\n\nTim Clark, director of interventional radiology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, which doesn\'t have a NanoKnife, says the device ""has potential to treat cancers next to delicate structures."" But for the time being, he says, ""there\'s a paucity of clinical data.""']","When ads tout ""real hope,"" journalists should ask ""how real?"" and ""what’s the evidence?"" That’s what this story does.","This story shows how ""a shortcut the Food and Drug Administration allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices"" has allowed the NanoKnife, an experimental treatment with very limited evidence, to be touted as the latest cure for cancer. The story hits nearly all of our marks, although we wish there were more detail in areas such as costs, potential benefits, and the overall evaluation of the evidence.

Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. So Choe and colleagues hypothesized that anticlotting drugs may lower the risk of dying among men with prostate cancer.\n\nThe study involved 5,275 men with localized cancer whose disease had not spread beyond the prostate gland; 1,982 of the men were taking anticlotting medications: aspirin, Lovenox, Plavix, and/or warfarin.\n\nBy 10 years after diagnosis, 10% of men not taking one of these medications had died from prostate cancer vs. 4% of those who took an anticlotting medication.\n\nThe risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Also, 43% of men who didn’t take anticlotting medications had a recurrence of their cancer, compared with 33% of men who did take them.\n\nMen who took aspirin gained the greatest benefit, Choe says.\n\nHarvard Medical School\'s Anthony Zietman, MD, president of ASTRO, tells WebMD that the findings are intriguing. However, they need to be confirmed, and the optimal dose, timing, and duration of use needs to be worked out, he says.\n\nAspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says.\n\n""We have to be sure the benefits outweigh the risks before we recommend this to patients.""\n\nThis study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.']",We think that WebMD – ,"



This story, like the Health Day story we reviewed on this study, reports that aspirin may cut the risk of death for some prostate cancer patients; a claim not supported by the study, which simply reported an association, not any cause-and-effect relationship. And the headline and lead don’t tell readers that the study is relevant only to certain men with localized prostate cancer. But at least this story alerts readers right away that the findings are preliminary and should not prompt men to start taking aspirin in hopes it could reduce their risk of prostate cancer death. It also includes a standard caution about medical meeting presentations not having gone through the type of peer review used by leading medical journals.

It did not prove cause and effect.\n\nResearchers for years have investigated vitamin D as a potential anti-cancer tool, but none of the findings have been strong enough to warrant a recommendation, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\n""Everyone comes to the same conclusion -- yes, there may be some benefit, but we really need to study it carefully so we can be certain there aren\'t other factors that make vitamin D look better than it is,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care.""\n\nIn this study, researchers measured blood levels of vitamin D in 1,043 patients enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial comparing three first-line treatments for newly diagnosed, advanced colon cancer. All of the treatments involved chemotherapy combined with the targeted anti-cancer drugs bevacizumab and/or cetuximab.\n\nVitamin D is called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because human bodies produce it when the sun\'s ultraviolet rays strike the skin. It promotes the intestines\' ability to absorb calcium and other important minerals, and is essential for maintaining strong, healthy bones, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\nBut vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. For example, she said it appears to reduce cell growth, promote the death of diseased cells, and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels to feed cancerous tumors.\n\nThe study authors found that certain types of cancer patients tended to have lower vitamin D levels. These included people whose blood specimens were drawn in the winter and spring months, people who live in the northern and northeastern states, older adults, blacks, overweight or obese people, and those who had lower physical activity and were in worse physical condition.\n\nThe patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high. After adjusting for prognosis and healthy behaviors, the researchers found that patients in the group with the highest levels of vitamin D lived about eight months longer on average than those in the group with the lowest levels.\n\n""We had a lot of information on their tumor, their treatment and their survival times, and their diet and lifestyle,"" Ng said. ""That really allowed us to adjust for other potential factors that could influence what we\'re seeing.""\n\nIt also took longer for cancer to progress in people with higher vitamin D levels -- an average 12.2 months compared with about 10 months in the group with the lowest. No significant differences were seen with regard to the type of therapy the patients received.\n\nThis increase in progression-free survival is the most compelling evidence indicating that vitamin D makes a difference in colon cancer, said Dr. Smitha Krishnamurthi, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.\n\n""That is interesting because that\'s more of a cancer-specific endpoint as opposed to overall survival, which could be influenced by other factors like heart health,"" Krishnamurthi said.\n\nEveryone should maintain healthy vitamin D levels anyway, to protect their bone health, Ng and Krishnamurthi said.\n\nBased on this new study, Krishnamurthi said she would emphasize the importance of vitamin D for patients with colon cancer.\n\n""They should take supplements to bring it into normal range, because we know it is good for bone health and it may have an anti-cancer effect,"" she said.\n\nHowever, ""if someone has a normal vitamin D level, I wouldn\'t take supplements to increase it because we won\'t know the true effect on cancer until we see the results of a clinical trial,"" she said.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health funded the study. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on vitamin D and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",We applaud the clear effort to solicit several different independent expert perspectives – a strong point with this story.,"This story reports the results of research presented at a symposium showing that metastatic colon cancer patients who had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood before undergoing chemo- and biological therapies survived substantially longer on average than similar patients with lower levels of the vitamin. Let’s be clear about this story’s many strengths: It duly noted the long and checkered history of research into the benefits of vitamin D, and that no advanced cancer patient should begin self-medicating with high-dose supplements. It was properly cautious in noting that the study had not yet undergone peer review and publication, and in quoting the investigators and outside experts about the study’s limitations.
With those strengths firmly in mind, we think this story could have done a few things better:

An early online version of this paper detailing the findings has been published and is scheduled for publication in the July 7 issue of the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is the most common age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that has no cure. Compelling evidence shows that toxic protein aggregates called Aβ oligomers selectively target and disrupt the points of communication between brain cells, impairing memory in people suffering from the disease. Because of this, there is a large consensus that preventing this kind of toxicity would be an effective treatment strategy.\n\nCalcineurin is an enzyme that regulates communication between brain cells and memory formation. The UTMB research team and others have shown previously that this enzyme plays a central role in the harmful effects of the Aβ oligomers and that elevated calcineurin is found in the nervous system of Alzheimer\'s patients.\n\nUsing a mouse model of Alzheimer\'s, the researchers earlier showed that blocking calcineurin restored memory function. However, the question of whether such a strategy would prevent the onset and progression of Alzheimer\'s in people is challenging because treatment with a calcineurin-blocking agent suppresses the immune system.\n\nTo bypass this issue, the UTMB team analyzed data from the medical records of 2,644 patients who received organ transplants and must take calcineurin inhibitor-based medications, such as Tacrolimus or cyclosporine, for the rest of their lives to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. As part of the medical care for transplant recipients, any evidence of memory impairment or dementia is immediately noted and monitored, as it can limit treatment compliance among these patients.\n\nThe participants were separated into groups by age at the time of last visit or death, gender and ethnicity. Eight participants showed evidence of dementia - two were younger than 65, five were in the 65-74 years old group and one was in the 75-84 years old group.\n\nThe UTMB study data was compared with national data obtained from the 2014 Alzheimer\'s Association Facts and Figures dataset on age-matched patients to compare the prevalence of Alzheimer\'s.\n\n""These data clearly show that the prevalence of dementia and Alzheimer\'s in our transplant patient group is significantly lower, in fact almost absent, when compared to national data from the general population,"" said senior author Luca Cicalese, professor in the department of surgery. ""In patients over 65 years, 11 percent of the general population had dementia compared with 1.02 percent of the study subjects. In Americans over 75 years, 15.3 percent of the population had dementia compared with 0.6 percent of the study subjects. Among Americans over 85 years, 32 percent had dementia, although we did not have any patients in this age group with dementia.""\n\nSince the people involved in the study mostly come from Texas, the researchers further compared their over 65 years old group with the prevalence of Alzheimer\'s in the general population of the state and got similar results.\n\n""Taken together, our findings from these people confirm the data obtained with animal models and support, for the first time in human subjects, our notion that calcineurin inhibition has a protective effect on the development and possible progression and even reversal of Alzheimer\'s disease,"" said senior author Giulio Taglialatela, Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the department of neurology and director of UTMB\'s Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases. ""Therefore, we are currently working on devising treatment strategies to obtain the same beneficial effects in AD humans using low doses of calcineurin inhibitors that result in minimal or no immunosuppression, thus limiting possible undesired side effects.""\n\n###\n\nUTMB\'s Cristiana Rastellini, Professor in the departments of Surgery and Microbiology & Immunology also was an author on this paper.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Mitchell Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases.']",The news release is a bit too enthusiastic about the results of a retrospective observational study showing that drugs like cyclosporine are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease.,"This release points to a novel strategy for targeting some of the pathology associated with Alzheimer’s disease that is newsworthy and deserves attention. The study that it describes shows that certain drugs may inhibit a key enzyme that contributes to Alzheimer’s plaque buildup in the brain — and that patients who took these drugs to prevent transplanted organ rejection had lower rates of Alzheimer’s disease compared with people who didn’t take these drugs. But the release’s overly enthusiastic tone may generate more than attention — it could engender false hope. The findings are interesting but preliminary, and the study’s retrospective, observational design has a number of limitations that deserved comment.

Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may “normalize” the child’s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.\n\n“There might be quite a profound neurological benefit,” he said in an interview.\n\nA growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients’ brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, http://www.psychcongress.com/video/are-A.D.H.D.-medications-neurotoxic-or-neuroprotective-16223an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said “we have enough data to say they’re actually neuroprotective.” The pills, he said, help “normalize” the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, “over years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.”\n\nMedication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills — mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.\n\nLeading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.\n\n“Sometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven’t seen it,” said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren’t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.\n\nResearch has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don’t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.\n\nIn arguing for “normalization,” Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107764 which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants “are associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.”\n\nBut other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective “exaggerated,” adding: “The best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications – normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.”\n\nA.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received “any personal income” from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.\n\nAs several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a “gold-standard” study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn’t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063023 co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren’t taking them.\n\nDr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don’t want to, adding that “most kids don’t want to.”\n\nDr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children’s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.\n\n“Eighty percent of them said ‘Love your child.

If a vaccinated addict on the path to recovery slips and indulges in a drug, such as tobacco or cocaine, no pleasure will result.\n\n""You still have to mentally say to yourself, \'I\'m not going to do this,\' but it\'s so much easier to say it when you know if you light a cigarette, you\'re not going to get any pleasure out of it,"" says Stephen Ballou, a 56-year-old banker who got a nicotine vaccine in a 2007 clinical trial to help kick his pack-a-day habit. He says he hasn\'t smoked since.\n\nSome medications currently available to treat addictions typically work by mimicking a drug in the brain. For example, methadone stands in for heroin and the nicotine patch for cigarettes. Other medications block activity in the brain\'s reward system. Alkermes Inc. \'s once-monthly Vivitrol injection does this for alcoholics and opioid addicts, while Pfizer Inc. \'s Chantix pills block the brain\'s pleasure receptors activated when people smoke.\n\nSmall-molecule drugs like Chantix that function inside the brain can raise safety concerns. Chantix carries a federally mandated warning to users of possible depression and suicidal thoughts. A spokesman for Pfizer notes that no causal link between Chantix and such symptoms has been made.\n\nBy contrast, addiction-treatment vaccines work in the bloodstream, not the brain. Clinical trials have so far revealed no significant side effects, though the vaccines would do nothing to combat cravings. They work by tricking the body to reject drugs as if they are foreign pathogens. Normally, tiny drug molecules wend their way through the bloodstream to the brain, unleashing a flood of chemicals involved with pleasure and gratification. The drug molecules are too small to goad the immune system into generating antibodies to fight them off.\n\nScientists have figured out how to attach molecules similar to addictive drugs to much bigger antigens, such as deactivated versions of cholera or the common cold. When injected, these so-called conjugate vaccines spur the immune system to create antibodies to fight the tiny, addictive-drug molecules. These antibodies have in several studies glommed on to molecules of nicotine, cocaine and heroin ingested by lab animals and in some cases people, blocking them from triggering the pleasure centers in the brain.\n\n4% to 7%: Percentage of attempts to quit smoking that are successful long term. Getty Images\n\n""The antibody is like a sponge,"" says Kim Janda, a professor of chemistry and immunology at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. ""The drug comes in and it\'s soaked up, and you try to soak up as much as you can before it crosses the blood-brain barrier.""\n\nIt could be years, if ever, before any vaccines to treat addiction reach the market. Failures have so far outnumbered successes, and big pharmaceutical companies haven\'t lent their research muscle to vaccines for illegal drugs.\n\n""These vaccines have the potential to transform the way we treat drug addiction, but there are challenges,"" says Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nA small Swedish firm, Independent Pharmaceutica AB, put its development of a nicotine vaccine on hold a year ago after it failed to outperform a placebo in trial. Convinced the concept of a nicotine vaccine remains sound, the company is now considering improvements to how the drug is delivered, says Lena Degling Wikingsson, a consultant and the company\'s former chief executive.\n\nAnother quit-smoking vaccine from Switzerland\'s Cytos Biotechnology—which has a licensing agreement with Novartis AG—failed to meet its endpoint in a 2009 trial. Work on that drug continues, however, with a new trial funded by the National Institutes of Health at Duke University in collaboration with Wake Forest University to test the vaccine in 65 smokers, Novartis says.\n\nStephen Evans-Freke, managing general partner of Bermuda-based private-equity firm Celtic Pharma Management, said a 2007 trial of a nicotine vaccine it owns ""failed totally"" because of a manufacturing error. He said the company could turn back to study the nicotine vaccine if a trial currently underway of the firm\'s TA-CD cocaine vaccine proves successful.\n\nUnlike smoking-cessation drugs such as Chantix, which function in a smoker\'s brain, a vaccine could work in the smoker\'s bloodstream. Pfizer Inc.\n\nA vaccine isn\'t viable for treating alcoholism—among the costliest of addictions—because alcohol molecules are far too small to trigger the immune system, says Thomas Kosten, a pioneer of addiction-vaccine research at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nMost commercial vaccine-development efforts are focused on tobacco. Slightly more than a fifth of U.S. adults light up regularly.\n\nNearly half of U.S. smokers try to quit each year, but just 4% to 7% of quit attempts—most of them unaided—are successful long-term, according to American Lung Association estimates.\n\nJust one out of three people trying to quit—at best—ends up kicking the habit for good, even with cessation aids, says Norman Edelman, the Association\'s chief medical officer and a professor of medicine at New York\'s Stony Brook University.\n\nNabi Biopharmaceuticals, a Rockville, Md., biotechnology company, is farthest down the path toward possible regulatory approval for an addiction vaccine, with two Phase III trials underway in several U.S. sites of its NicVAX product to help people quit smoking.\n\n""The relapse is the biggest thing,"" says Raafat Fahim, the company\'s chief executive. ""With antibodies staying a long period of time with you, it then protects you against the relapses.""\n\nNabi in 2009 got a $10 million grant from NIDA, and sealed a licensing pact with the U.K.\'s GlaxoSmithKline PLC that, including a $40 million up-front payment, could be worth up to $500 million, plus possible royalty payments.\n\nNabi\'s Phase II trial—the one Mr. Ballou participated in—found that smokers taking NicVAX were about three times as likely to be off cigarettes 44 weeks after vaccination than subjects given a placebo, Dr. Fahim says. That test was very small, and the results weren\'t as good as Pfizer got from a much larger Phase III trial of Chantix, he says. Subjects in Nabi\'s Phase III trial will get an extra dosage of NicVax compared to those in the Phase II trial.\n\nOne of the possible advantages of a vaccine, which would likely be used alongside psychological therapy and possibly other medications, is that it could require a once-a-month injection, as opposed to current anti-addiction medications that sometimes need to be taken several times a day.\n\n""It\'s a lot easier to take a couple of vaccinations than to put on a patch every day, or keep chewing that nicotine gum, or doing whatever measures you\'re taking,"" says Phil Skolnick, director of the division of pharmacotherapies and medical consequences of drug abuse at NIDA.\n\nRecent results from a test of an anticocaine vaccine in mice at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York were encouraging, researchers say.\n\n""We give intravenous dosages of cocaine that\'s in excess of what humans take and it\'s like water to the mice"" that have received the vaccine, says Ronald Crystal, the study\'s lead investigator and the chairman of genetic medicine at Weill Cornell. ""They don\'t run around and get hyperactive."" The researchers are now studying the vaccine in non-human primates.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Kosten continues work on the TA-CD cocaine vaccine with a 300-subject, randomized, multi-site trial. Dr. Kosten says he hopes to report on the outcome of this trial sometime next year.\n\nWrite to Mark Long at mark.long@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nThomas Kosten researches addiction vaccines at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

But new research indicates that such patients, paradoxically, may live longer if they receive a milder chemotherapy drug.\n\nTreatment with the less intensive drug, decitabine, is not a cure. But surprisingly, AML patients whose leukemia cells carried mutations in a nefarious cancer gene called TP53 consistently achieved remission after treatment with decitabine. Their median survival was just over a year.\n\nThe study, by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published Nov. 24 in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn AML, treatment involves intensive chemotherapy to try to kill the patient’s leukemia cells and put the cancer into remission. If successful, a follow-up bone-marrow transplant can offer a possible cure, but this course of treatment is recommended only for patients with a high risk of relapse because the procedure can cause severe complications, even death.\n\n“What’s really unique here is that all the patients in the study with TP53 mutations had a response to decitabine and achieved an initial remission,” said the study’s senior author, Timothy J. Ley, MD, the Lewis T. and Rosalind B. Apple Professor of Medicine, noting that in AML, TP53 mutations have been correlated with an extremely poor prognosis. “With standard aggressive chemotherapy, we only see about 20 to 30 percent of these patients achieving remission, which is the critical first step to have a chance to cure patients with additional therapies.\n\n“The findings need to be validated in a larger trial,” Ley added, “but they do suggest that TP53 mutations can reliably predict responses to decitabine, potentially prolonging survival in this ultra high-risk group of patients and providing a bridge to transplantation in some patients who might not otherwise be candidates.”\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Elihu Estey, MD, an AML expert at the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, noted that AML is not one disease but many, each driven by different genetic mutations. The results of the current trial, he said, point to the inevitable need to replace large cancer clinical trials evaluating homogeneous drug treatments with smaller trials that involve subgroups of patients, with treatments targeted to their specific mutations.\n\nThe current study involved 116 patients treated with decitabine at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and at the University of Chicago. The patients either had AML – a cancer of the bone marrow – or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a group of blood cancers that often progresses to AML. This year, an estimated 20,000 people living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AML, and at least 11,000 deaths will be attributed to the disease.\n\nDecitabine often is given to older patients with AML or MDS because it is less toxic than standard chemotherapies. But fewer than half of patients who get the drug achieve an initial remission, so the researchers wanted to determine whether specific mutations in the patients’ cancer cells could predict their responses to treatment.\n\nTo find out, they sequenced all the genes in patients’ cancer cells or analyzed select cancer genes. They also conducted standard tests to look for broken, missing or rearranged chromosomes. Then, the researchers correlated these molecular markers with treatment response to identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from decitabine.\n\nAmong the patients in the study, 46 percent achieved a remission with decitabine. But, remarkably, all 21 patients whose leukemia cells carried TP53 mutations went into remission.\n\nPatients also were likely to respond to decitabine if they were deemed to have an “unfavorable risk” prognosis based on extensive chromosomal rearrangements in their cancer cells; many of these patients also had TP53 mutations. Indeed, 66 percent of patients with an unfavorable risk achieved remission, compared with 34 percent of patients who had more favorable prognoses.\n\n“The challenge with using decitabine has been knowing which patients are most likely to respond,” said co-author Amanda Cashen, MD, an associate professor of medicine who led an earlier clinical trial of decitabine in older patients with AML. “The value of this study is the comprehensive mutational analysis that helps us figure out which patients are likely to benefit. This information opens the door to using decitabine in a more targeted fashion to treat not just older patients, but also younger patients who carry TP53 mutations.”\n\nFirst author John Welch, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine, added: “It’s important to note that patients with an extremely poor prognosis in this relatively small study had the same survival outcomes as patients facing a better prognosis, which is encouraging. We don’t yet understand why patients with TP53 mutations consistently respond to decitabine, and more work is needed to understand that phenomenon.”\n\nResponses to decitabine are usually short-lived, however, with remissions typically lasting for about a year. Decitabine does not completely clear all the leukemia cells that carry TP53 mutations, and these cells invariably become resistant to the drug, leading to relapse.\n\n“Remissions with decitabine typically don’t last long, and no one was cured with this drug,” Ley explained. “But patients who responded to decitabine live longer than what you would expect with aggressive chemotherapy, and that can mean something. Some people live a year or two and with a good quality of life, because the chemotherapy is not too toxic.”\n\nRoughly 10 percent of AML patients carry TP53 mutations in their leukemia cells. Among patients in the study with such mutations, median survival was 12.7 months – which is not significantly different from the 15.4 months’ survival seen in patients without the mutations – and is longer than the typical four- to six-month survival observed in such patients treated with more aggressive therapies.\n\nDecitabine was approved by the FDA in 2006 as a treatment for MDS, but oncologists often prescribe it off-label as a treatment for AML, particularly in older patients. AML typically strikes in a person’s mid-60s; the average age of people in the current study was 74.\n\n“We’re now planning a larger trial to evaluate decitabine in AML patients of all ages who carry TP53 mutations,” Welch said. “It’s exciting to think we may have a therapy that has the potential to improve response rates in this group of high-risk patients.”\n\nThe research is supported by an AML-SPORE grant and the Genomics of AML Program Project grant, both from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), grant numbers P50 CA171963 and P01 CA101937.\n\nWelch J, Petti A, Miller C, Fronick C, O’Laughlin M, Fulton R, Wilson R, Baty J, Duncavage E, Tandon B, Lee Y-S, Wartman L, Uy G, Ghobadi A, Tomasson M, Pusic I, Romee R, Fehniger T, Stockerl-Goldstein K, Vig R, Oh S, Abboud C, Cashen A, Schroeder M, Jacoby M, Heath S, Luber K, Janke M, Hantel A, Khan N, Sukanova M, Knoebel R, Stock W, Graubert T, Walter M, Westervelt P, Link D, DiPersio J and Ley T.

Decitabine, a drug usually seen as a milder form of chemotherapy, may be an improved treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who also have mutations in the TP53 gene, according to this news release from Washington University in St. Louis. People with AML who have this gene mutation usually also have a more difficult-to-treat disease. In this study, researchers identified patients with TP53 mutations and then ran a drug trial to see if there was a correlation between the mutations and remission with decitabine. Remission with decitabine lasted about a year, while other remissions for this group following traditional chemotherapy usually average 4 to 6 months. The researchers found a similar response to the drug in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, often a precurser to AML.
The release makes it abundantly clear that this is a preliminary trial result while providing a good description of benefits and an adequate overview of the trial. It would have been stronger with a brief discussion of costs for both decitabine and traditional treatment for AML. And since one of the benefits of decitabine is its lower toxicity, a brief discussion on reduced side effects would have been helpful to patients.

Some researchers have gone as far as to warn that popping them may be harmful.\n\nBut the fact is that most of us cannot get the vitamins and minerals we need from food alone, and multivitamins are vital to bridging that gap. According to a study published in the January 2015 edition of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, roughly 40 percent of adults are deficient in vitamin A, C, D, E, calcium and magnesium. These findings suggest many people may not even have the nutrient levels they need to stave off disease— let alone thrive and live in optimal health. As I see it, everyone needs a multivitamin for disease prevention, and new research agrees.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother study, published in the January 2015 edition of the journal Postgraduate Medicine, suggests that 68,000 cancers per year would be prevented with daily multivitamin use. The study followed only men, but my take is there’s no reason to assume this doesn’t apply to women as well. In the study, multivitamins lowered cancer risk by 27 percent among men with a history of cancer and by 8 percent among men with no history of the disease. This new study used a randomized, controlled trial design— a method that is considered to be the “gold standard” for proof in medical science.\n\nI’ve always recommended targeted vitamin supplementation to my patients because when you boost levels of key nutrients in your body, you give yourself the best chances of preventing cancer, heart disease, dementia and other diseases.\n\nWhile several previous studies failed to prove the benefits of some vitamins, the fact is, many of those studies have been criticized for poor design and are the reason fewer tangible benefits have been proven. At the very least, you should be taking a multivitamin every day. That said, not all multivitamins are created equal— some contain cheaper and less absorbable forms of nutrients, so you won’t get their full benefits, and others have ingredients you should be wary of.\n\nHere are a few tips for selecting a high-quality multivitamin that will help you look and feel your best:\n\nGo for high quality\n\nWhen you look at a typical multivitamin label at the drugstore, you’ll see it has about 100 percent of the daily values recommended for a nutrient. The federal government developed these values during World War II to prevent widespread nutrient deficiency— so while that amount should be enough to make sure you have what you need to survive, it won’t necessarily be enough for optimal health.\n\nIn some of the higher-quality supplements, you\'ll see things like Vitamin B-6 at 2,500 percent of your daily value. That may sound wacky, but keep in mind that 100 percent is just the level for basic survival— and that 2,500 percent is going to give you more of what you actually need to feel good. Look for high-quality brands with these higher doses. Because I know there can be a lot of guesswork when it comes to finding a good multivitamin, I created my own formula specifically designed to provide key nutrients that boost your energy, which is available on my website.\n\nGet one that will be absorbed well by your body\n\nSome forms of vitamins are better absorbed in your body. When scanning the label, look for B12 as methylcobalamin as opposed to cyanocobalamin, and when it comes to folic acid, look for methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) rather than straight folic acid. Both are forms of B9, but MTHF is the form of B9 found in nature. For vitamin A, look for beta carotene and mixed carotenoids, which are derived from plants and are water soluble. And look for vitamin D3 as opposed to D2. Seventy years ago, these two forms of vitamin D were seen as equals, but recent research has shown that D3 is a more potent form of D.\n\nAvoid toxic fillers\n\nSome vitamin companies use colorants and coatings that may be harmful. These include hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide. Magnesium stearate could even compromise your immunity— a study in the journal Immunology found that stearic acid suppresses T cells, a key part of your immune system. The vitamins you take should enhance your health, so be sure to scan the labels for these cheap additives and steer clear of them.\n\nDr. Jennifer Landa is Chief Medical Officer of BodyLogicMD, the nation\'s largest franchise of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy.

And they\'re doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating depression.\n\n""It became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine,"" says David Feifel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who began administering the drug to patients in 2010.\n\nKetamine was developed as an anesthetic and received FDA approval for this use in 1970. Decades later, it became popular as a psychedelic club drug. And in 2006, a team from the National Institute of Mental Health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced ""robust and rapid antidepressant effects"" within a couple of hours.\n\nSince then, thousands of depressed patients have received ""off-label"" treatment with ketamine.\n\nOne of those patients is Paul, 36, who lives in San Diego and is a patient of Dr. Feifel. We\'re not using his last name to protect his medical privacy.\n\nPaul\'s depression began with anxiety. ""I was an extremely anxious child,"" he says. ""I would always make choices based on fear. My life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that I could do.""\n\nAs Paul grew up, his extreme anxiety led to major depression, which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days. ""I lived in pain,"" he says.\n\nPaul managed to get through college and a stint in the Peace Corps. But most days were a struggle. And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief.\n\nHe tried just about every drug used for depression, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and even electroconvulsive therapy, which induces a brief seizure. But nothing worked — at least not for very long.\n\nPaul says he was increasingly haunted by ""this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where I felt the pain the most.""\n\nThen one day, while investigating depression on the Internet, Paul discovered the research on ketamine. ""It was clear to me that this was real,"" he says.\n\nOrdinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn\'t qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. And doctors usually won\'t prescribe a mind-altering club drug to someone with a mental illness.\n\nBut the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors, including Feifel, are bypassing the usual protocols.\n\nBy the time Feifel began hearing about ketamine, he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs. Too often, he says, they just weren\'t helping his patients.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of David Feifel Courtesy of David Feifel\n\nA major study on antidepressant medication published in 2008 seemed to confirm his suspicions. It found that current antidepressants really aren\'t much better than a placebo.\n\nMany psychiatrists criticized that study. But not Feifel. ""I was kind of like, I\'m not surprised,"" he says. ""These really don\'t seem like powerful tools.""\n\nFeifel remembers feeling ""professionally embarrassed"" that psychiatrists didn\'t have something better to offer their depressed patients. Something like ketamine.\n\nHe knew the drug had risks. It could be abused. It could produce hallucinations. And it didn\'t have the FDA\'s OK for treating depression.\n\nBut he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine. It\'s been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing. And ketamine\'s safety record is so good that it\'s often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.\n\nSo in 2010, Feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients. The decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists, including Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""While the science is promising, ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic,"" Insel wrote in his blog a few months ago.\n\n""There are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it\'s ready, which doesn\'t make sense to me,"" Feifel says. It\'s hard to take the wait-and-see approach when you\'re treating patients who are desperate for help, he adds.\n\nPaul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to Feifel in March of 2014. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says.\n\nAnd Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine. ""If there was even a 1 percent chance that this worked, it would have been worth it to me,"" he says. ""My life was hanging in the balance.""\n\nAnd for Paul, the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections.\n\n""I remember I was in my bathroom and I literally fell to my knees crying because I had no anxiety, I had no depression,"" he says\n\nFor the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks. He feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug. The effect on depression and anxiety, though, lasts more than a month.\n\nKetamine doesn\'t always work that well, Feifel says. After treating more than 100 patients, he\'s beginning to understand the drug\'s limitations.\n\nOne is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly. Feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine. But ""we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day,"" he says.\n\nAlso, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don\'t cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental.\n\nEven so, ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket.

Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure ""off-label,"" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer\'s to autism.\n\nNational Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.\n\nIn a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.\n\nElliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association\'s Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.\n\n""Kudos for funding a trial that says, \'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let\'s let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,\'"" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.\n\nIn a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston\'s Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, ""Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.""\n\nYet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.\n\nCardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA\'s most respected heart experts, says he\'s concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.\n\n""This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,"" Nissen says. Chelation ""should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.""\n\nAt least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine.\n\nEven the study\'s lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance.\n\n""A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,"" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. ""The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.""\n\nThe trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.\n\nThe study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation\'s risks.\n\nIn response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms — the documents that explain a study\'s risks and benefits to patients — which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.\n\nFederal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.\n\nStephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he\'s also concerned about the reliability of its findings.\n\nThe overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance — the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke — by only 0.001.\n\nFurther analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances, that\'s not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.\n\nThis study\'s findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.\n\nIn addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says.\n\nThat large of a dropout rate — which is normally no more than about 3% — could skew the study\'s findings, Kopecky says.\n\n""That\'s a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that\'s not highly regulated by the FDA,"" Kopecky says.\n\nKopecky also acknowledges that there\'s no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. ""That is a million-dollar question,"" he said.\n\nMore than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.\n\n""All of these factors call into question the results,"" says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen\'s Health Research Group.\n\nNIH officials say the trial was worthwhile. Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, says the study was a ""breakthrough"" not for proving that chelation works, but for ""establishing that this chelation therapy regimen can be administered in a safe manner in the context of a clinical trial.""']",This story reports on a troubled NIH-funded study of chelation therapy.  The cited experts are extremely strong in their statements that this not be adopted into clinical practice.

There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.\n\n""OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,"" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children\'s teeth, but Manski\'s patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.\n\nSo Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash\'s teeth. ""We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,"" Manski says. ""The fluoride varnish will help that.""\n\nOne way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that\'s naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth\'s natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it\'s so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.\n\nIt takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.\n\n""These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,"" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what\'s making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient\'s risk of getting cavities.\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person\'s risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.\n\n""It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,"" Featherstone says. ""Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn\'t deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth."" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.\n\nTraditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That\'s still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. ""It\'s a little bit like your car is starting to rust,"" he says. ""If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you\'re in good shape.""\n\nLike rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.\n\n""In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it\'s slowly progressive,"" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.\n\nStriking as these results seem, the concept isn\'t new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. ""Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,"" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.\n\n""Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,"" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. ""What we\'re seeing is a generational shift,"" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.\n\nBut cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn\'t give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.\n\nCost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they\'ll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.\n\nAt this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.\n\n""It will happen,"" Featherstone says. ""It\'s just a matter of time.""']","This “better safe than sorry” story about the advantages of more intensive measures to prevent tooth decay is thick with promises, but thin with evidence about who might benefit and by how much.","This “better safe than sorry” story about the advantages of more intensive measures to prevent tooth decay in adults is thick with promises, but thin with evidence about who might benefit and by how much.
The strong points: The reporter did a good job talking to multiple sources, and made an effort to discuss costs and availability, including insurance factors. However, the story quoted only proponents of more intensive preventive dental treatments for adults, producing a story lacking hard-nosed scrutiny of the feel-good claims.

People have been looking for something like this for years,” said Dagan Wells of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Oxford University.\n\nThe average age for menopause is 51, with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age 40 and 60. But it can happen later or earlier, making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait.\n\nTehrani’s team took blood samples from 266 women aged between 20 and 49 who were also taking part in another study called the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, which started in 1998.\n\nThey then measured concentrations of a hormone called the anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) that is produced by cells in women’s ovaries. AMH controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop, and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function.\n\nSTATISTICAL MODEL\n\nThe researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the women’s socioeconomic background and reproductive history.\n\n“We developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of AMH concentration,” Tehrani explained in a report on the study. “Using this model, we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span.”\n\nTehrani said the results showed “a good level of agreement” between predicted and actual age at menopause for the 63 women in the group who reached menopause during the study.\n\nThe average difference between the predicted age and the women’s actual age at menopause was a third of a year, and the maximum margin of error was three to four years.\n\nWells said Tehrani’s team appeared to have hit upon a “fairly accurate algorithm” for predicting menopause.\n\nBut said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends.\n\n“A woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at 50, but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this,” he said. “It will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation.”']","A definitive headline – ""Scientist find way to predict…"" – is far more definitive than the findings of the study reported.  The story fails to explain the many possible limitations of this approach. ","Anti-Mullerian Hormone, or AMH, is a hormone produced by cells in the ovary during reproductive years and can be detected with a blood test. Declining AMH levels has been shown to correlate with poor response to in-vitro fertilization, a marker of poor ovarian reserve. This has led to the idea that the test could be used to predict the start of the menopausal transition. However, because the marker has not been studied systematically, it is unclear what different AMH levels mean. For example, what is a normal AMH level? As a result, AMH levels should be interpreted with some caution.
This story reports on results from a new study whose results are to be presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. The study investigators developed an algorithm using AMH levels to predict onset of menopause. However, the full results of the study have not been made available and have not been evaluated by experts.
This story does little to explain to the reader the limitations of the AMH test. It presents the assertion that the test is reliable as fact and does not discuss any potential downsides. False positive results, for example, could cause unnecessary worry and anxiety and lead to needless fertility treatments. The story also does not say whether the AMH test is new or not. In fact, it is not new and is one of group of tests that are intended to evaluate ovarian reserve. However, the study does not mention any of those other tests that are available.

This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.\n\n“Wars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,"" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. “This is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.""\n\nOther companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.\n\nAdditional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.\n\nThe REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.\n\nA control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.\n\nStein characterized the results of the trial as “pretty dramatic.”\n\nA PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins ""because it\'s unlike any other drug. With statins you get toxicity – with these drugs we don’t see any side effects with the antibody.”\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, authors Dr. Stephen G. Young, and Loren G. Fong, Ph.D. write: “At this point, the status of PCSK9 therapeutics appears to be full speed ahead. Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.”\n\nHowever, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.\n\nThe cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say. But they also note that ""patients who cannot tolerate statins could benefit greatly.""\n\nIf the results are confirmed, “This is game changing science,” said Dr. Richard A. Stein, a spokesman for the American Heart Association who\'s not related to the study author or involved in the research.\n\nStein called the trial results “a very important breakthrough,"" while being careful to note that they represent early science which should be confirmed through larger and longer studies.\n\nHe said the study methodology was thorough because it included people with high cholesterol as well as people with genetic familial high cholesterol, which is proven to be a result of impaired PCSK9 genetic function.']",Emphasizing “dramatic…breakthrough…and game-changing” about results of a Phase I clinical trial is troubling.,"The story was generally fairly complete.  But the cheerleading drowned out the caveats in our view.

Maugh II, Los Angeles Times\n\n5:00 AM PST, November 23, 2010\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a finding that is being widely hailed as the first major prevention breakthrough in the AIDS era, researchers have shown that taking a single daily pill containing two HIV drugs can reduce risk of contracting the virus by an average of 44% — and by more than 70% if the subjects take most of their pills.\n\n\n\nThe study involved nearly 2,500 high-risk gay men, but experts hope that the results will be applicable to other populations considered at risk for contracting the virus. Several studies are already underway to determine if that is the case.\n\n\n\nThe findings, reported online Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, come only a few months after an African study showed that a microbicidal gel can help protect women from contracting the virus and a little more than a year after a vaccine trial suggested that it may eventually be possible to raise antibodies against the virus.\n\n\n\n""To see all these prevention strategies come together, we can begin to see an end to the epidemic,"" said A. Cornelius Baker of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. ""The National AIDS Strategy introduced by the president in July called for reducing the U.S. epidemic by 25%. … If we can prove this works and get this strategy into the communities, we can reach that goal much quicker than we had anticipated and move even further to more goals.""\n\n\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which was the major sponsor of the study, cautioned, however, that ""No single prevention strategy is going to be effective for everyone, and it is important to note that the new findings pertain only to … men who have sex with men.""\n\n\n\nExperts agreed, however, that there is no reason to think that it would not be successful in other groups, although it must be tested.\n\n\n\nThe new strategy is called pre-exposure prophylaxis, and that is an approach that has been used successfully in certain other diseases. Malaria or tuberculosis drugs, for example, are frequently prescribed to people entering areas with high transmission rates. Antiretroviral drugs are also used to prevent transmission of HIV from mothers to infants during and after birth and in an effort to prevent infection after accidental exposure in hospitals and laboratories.\n\n\n\nThe new study, called iPrEx, was conducted by an international team headed by Dr. Robert M. Grant of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology at UC San Francisco and Dr. Javier R. Lama of Investigaciones Medicas en Salud in Lima, Peru. They enrolled 2,499 men and transgender women who have sex with men at 11 sites in six countries.\n\n\n\nHalf were given a daily dose of Truvada, a pill containing the AIDS drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir, and half a placebo. Truvada was chosen because it is effective, has few side effects and is already used by more than 1.5 million people worldwide. Subjects were followed for an average of 14 months, and given counseling about using condoms and safe sex practices.\n\n\n\nThe researchers observed 36 HIV infections in the group taking Truvada, compared to 64 in the control group taking placebo, a reduction of 43.8%. The reduction in risk, however, was very sensitive to how regularly the subjects took the medication. For those who took it on more than 50% of the days, as determined by pill counts and other measures, the risk fell by 50.2%. For those who took it 90% or more of the days, the risk fell by 72.8%.\n\n\n\nSide effects of the drug were mild, and included nausea in the first month, small increases in serum creatinine and unintentional weight loss.\n\n\n\nThe subjects will be followed for another 18 months to monitor for long-term effects. In a separate study now underway, the drug is being tested in women. In separate arms of that study, researchers are also testing tenofovir only and a gel containing tenofovir.\n\n\n\nMore information is available at the trial\'s official website: iPrExNews.com\n\n\n\nthomas.maugh@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The impressive-sounding 70% relative risk reduction figure in the headline is finally tempered a bit deep in this story about an important drug trial for HIV prevention in high risk men. </span>","We could hear the champagne glasses clinking when we read the headline and the top of this story about the potential for a drug to prevent HIV infections.

They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.\n\n“We’ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,” says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization — for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.\n\nBut conventional germicidal lamps aren’t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. “So up until now, they’re only really practical when people aren’t around,” say Brenner. “You can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone’s inside.”\n\nAbout five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can’t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.\n\n“We wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,” says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. “We haven’t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we’ve always seen lots of biological damage,” he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.\n\nNow, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.\n\n“We think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,” says Brenner. “Think about doctor’s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes—any place where there’s a likelihood for airborne viruses.” And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.\n\nBrenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. “The lamp we’re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,” he says. “We don’t see cost as being a limiting factor here.”\n\nGet The Brief.

Researchers in this study wanted to know if “far-UVC” light might kill H1N1, a common strain of flu virus, and therefore be used as a potential disinfectant.
In addition to this TIME Health story, we also looked at coverage of this study by HealthDay. We found Time’s headline to be a bit overreaching given that this study was performed in a small test chamber (smaller than a square foot) and it’s unclear whether the disinfecting results noted would even apply to a larger space.
Most importantly, both the coverage by TIME and HealthDay would have been strengthened by including supporting data from the study, as well as a discussion of the limitations.

Repeat: The benefits of controlled breathing,"['After 12 weeks of daily yoga and coherent breathing, the subjects’ depressive symptoms significantly decreased and their levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a brain chemical that has calming and anti-anxiety effects, had increased. The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention.\n\n“The findings were exciting,” she said. “They show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.”\n\nControlled breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects’ saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group’s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August.\n\nHere are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own.\n\nCoherent Breathing\n\nIf you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.']","While some readers may have welcomed some timely stress management advice, there’s really not much news here.","This election-week story attempts to give readers news you can use: how to calm yourself with deep breathing exercises.

Many experts indicate that there is an association between people with the disorder and the desire to light up.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Newcorn, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of ADHD and Learning Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says that there is indeed a relationship between ADHD and smoking. ""People with ADHD are at somewhat of an increased risk to abuse drugs,"" he says, adding that the drug they\'re more likely to resort to is nicotine because of its role in modulating the neurotransmission of dopamine in the brain.\n\nPeople with ADHD don\'t produce as much dopamine – a neurotransmitter linked to the ability to regulate emotional response – as someone without the disorder. Dopamine is also associated with feelings of reward and pleasure. Research has found a connection between ADHD symptoms and lowered dopamine levels, or issues with the efficiency of the brain\'s dopamine receptors.\n\nNewcorn explains that through the years there have also been some schools of thought that people with ADHD have a harder time quitting the habit. This ultimately drove researchers to think about developing a nonstimulant alternative in the form of a drug that safely mimics the effects of nicotine. However, he says that this hasn\'t yet panned out.\n\nInstead, what has gained more attention, Newcorn says, is research about any possible roles ADHD stimulant medications may play in helping someone with the disorder quit, or at least reduce nicotine use. ""There has been and continues to be a lot of interest in this area,"" Newcorn says.\n\nMore About Smoking Less, Not Stopping Completely\n\nAccording to Scott H. Kollins, professor and vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, there isn\'t a concrete ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether ADHD stimulants can help an ADHD person quit. In fact, he says that rather than this being an issue of quitting the habit altogether, it appears that the focus is more about ADHD stimulants\' role in possibly lessening the number of cigarettes smoked.\n\nIn fact, Kollins was involved in a study – published in the Journal of Attention Disorders – that touched on this very subject. The journal states that ""our findings suggest that among adult regular smokers with ADHD who are interested in quitting, LDX does not increase the probability of smoking cessation more than does placebo, but is associated with a significant overall reduction in the amount of cigarettes smoked and is effective for reducing ADHD symptoms."" LDX stands for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, an ADHD stimulant more commonly known by the brand name Vyvanse.\n\nIn this and other related research Kollins has been involved with, he says that overall, ""stimulants don\'t necessarily help people with ADHD quit smoking; people don\'t really improve any greater than with a placebo."" However, he states that ""the people taking ADHD stimulants smoked less compared to those taking a placebo.""\n\nKollins also points out that this study yielded results comparable other research on the topic. In fact, the LDX study notes that ""findings from this study are consistent with another published trial of osmotic-release methylphenidate in adult smokers with ADHD, which reported no effects of the stimulant drug on smoking cessation outcomes, but reductions in cigarettes smoked/day and significant drug-placebo differences in ADHD symptoms across the study (Winhusen et al., 2010)."" Concerta is an example of an osmotic-release methylphenidate.\n\nAll of this begs the question: What is it about ADHD stimulant medication that may produce this effect? Kollins explains that ""stimulants do similar things from a pharmacologic perspective as nicotine"" suggesting that taking such medication may replace the urge to light up as frequently. Treatment with stimulants may put ""the urge to smoke in check more,"" he speculates.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nSuch research isn\'t to say that taking ADHD stimulants will automatically make a person with the disorder ease up on their habit. ""You certainly couldn\'t say that stimulants could be used for smoking cessation in people with ADHD,"" Newcorn says. ""On the other hand, stimulants are an appropriate treatment for people with ADHD whether they smoke or not."" He explains that currently, thinking about stimulants in terms of helping people with ADHD with smoking cessation means ""talking about something off-label"" – in other words, not for intended use despite the fact that certain positive outcomes may arise by taking it.\n\nBut Newcorn adds that there may be ""reasonable strategies"" such as limiting a medication to a specific group of people and within a specific class of medication. For example, he explains that Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, and Zyban, a drug to help a person stop smoking, are the same drug, but they are marketed for different things. ""Many studies show that Wellbutrin could have a positive effect for people with ADHD,"" he says, making the point that sorting through such labeling and marketing intricacies could play a role in further exploration on the topic.']","When it comes to the ADHD drug Vyvanse helping smokers quit, this article is much ado about nothing.","This US News & World Report story discusses the possibility that some drugs used mainly to control attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be useful in helping people quit smoking.
The story focuses on a very small pilot study where researchers claim an ADHD drug, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, reduced the number of cigarettes a person smoked, although it had no effect on stopping their smoking habit. The story doesn’t mention either the cost of the drug nor any harms that might come from its use. It also doesn’t  provide enough information about the study itself for readers to adequately evaluate its results. Nor does it disclose that the study was funded by a pharmaceutical company and that some members of the research team receive support from pharmaceutical firms.

The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.\n\nKing worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.\n\nIn the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer.\n\nParticipants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional “booster” sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that.\n\nScientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks.\n\nResults of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory.\n\nThe new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008.\n\nThe program is now incorporated in Posit Science’s BrainHQ.com brain training program.\n\nEdwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia.\n\nShe found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit.\n\nPeople who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said.\n\n“At first blush, that’s kind of a big deal,” Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. “This may even be clinically relevant.”\n\nIn 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University’s Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was “little evidence” of such results from brain games. The letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data.\n\nEdwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate, which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published. “I’m sick of our studies being ignored,” she said.\n\nKing said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current Posit Science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia.\n\n“It’s a promising result from an interesting data set,” he said. “I do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed.”']",This is a re-analysis of data from a study that wasn’t powered to detect dementia outcomes. The findings should be interpreted more cautiously than the headline suggests.,"
A preliminary analysis of a 10-year study suggests computer-based cognitive-training software, also known as “brain games,” may lower the risk of dementia among healthy adults. The article exhibits some skepticism as it points out these findings have yet to undergo rigorous peer review. And there’s useful context, including discussion of a previous analysis done on the same dataset which revealed a much less rosy picture. The story also delves into the relationships between past and current investigators, and the company Posit Science which owns BrainHQ.com.
The article would be more complete if a clarification was included on how dementia risk was assessed. The story should also have mentioned — as a competing piece from MedPageToday points out — that the 10-year study wasn’t powered to detect dementia outcomes. In fact, the new secondary analysis presented here could be viewed as an attempt to salvage the 10-year study and show a benefit that wasn’t evident in the primary analysis. This is the drawback of a data mining approach to making statistical inference; if you look hard enough, you will always find something.

Conrad/The New York Times\n\nA new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners. But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.\n\nRunning a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.\n\nTo study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would — in the name of science — be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.\n\nAll of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half — about two to three pints — of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men’s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.\n\nFor the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.\n\nThe men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. “Incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower” in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.\n\nThese effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner’s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn’t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. “It can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)” in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.\n\nJust how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage’s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, “suppress viral replication” and “influence the innate immune system positively,” all beneficial for fighting off a cold.\n\nAlcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too — “even more than nonalcoholic beer,” Dr. Scherr said — but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. “We do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,” he wrote. “Furthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.” We all knew that, right?\n\nOf course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation “is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.”\n\nBut the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.\n\nAll of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, “When I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer ‘Yes.’”\n\nIt’s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. “But with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,” he said, “so nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal” for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race. For that, at least, the beer can be full-potency.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">With this review, we welcome </span>","



The story states that it’s reporting on “a new study” but it never explains that the study is only an abstract of a presentation given at a professional meeting. Thus the data have not been peer-reviewed,  and no detailed methods or results are available.  The only perspective on the research comes from the lead author, and no other alternatives for marathon recovery are discussed.   
The story specifically states that the beer was only effective if it was nonalcoholic. However, this was not tested, so this is unknown. In addition, the properties of the nonalcoholic beer that might be responsible for the beneficial effects are not known, since it’s not clear what placebo beverage was used. The lead researcher is quoted as hypothesizing  that the beneficial effects of the beer might be due to the presence of polyphenols, but there is no evidence to support this. The story then focuses in on polyphenols, discussing other foods that contain large amounts of polyphenols.

People who were taking medication for OCD continued to do so for the trial.\n\nOverall, 38% of the people with the real device responded to the treatment compared with 11% of those with the sham device.

Treatments are needed on an ongoing basis in most cases, and are delivered in a clinical setting by health care specialists. This type of device was first approved by the FDA for use in major depression and some migraine conditions.
The text of the story only thinly describes the very limited clinical trial that informed the new FDA decision, and doesn’t go much beyond a news release from the company.

They cost much more than generic warfarin, roughly $8 a day instead of $1 or less. And Eliquis and Pradaxa require two pills a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, instead of the once-daily warfarin. The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The drug acts on an enzyme that leads to blood clots.\n\nDr. Christopher B. Granger, the study’s lead author and a professor of medicine at Duke University, said, “I think this is a profound trial result that will have a major impact on the practice and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. It combines both greater efficacy in terms of prevention of stroke with a substantial reduction to bleeding risk, and that package is one that will be particularly compelling.”\n\nWall Street has high expectations, too.

As many as 12 million people will have it by 2020 because of an aging population with longer life expectancy. The arrhythmia in the left upper chamber of the heart can cause slow blood flow and clots, raising the risk of stroke by four to six times on average, the government says.\n\nAs many as half of people with the condition, however, are untreated, by varying estimates. Warfarin, a cheap 60-year-old drug sold generically under the brand name Coumadin, requires frequent blood tests to monitor its active level and interacts with some other drugs and foods, including leafy greens. There is great appeal and demand for new drugs that do not vary so much and deliver the same stroke-preventing benefits.\n\nThe first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. In the first seven months on market, about four in five cardiologists and two in five primary care doctors had prescribed it to more than 250,000 people, Wa’el Hashad, Boehringer’s vice president for cardiovascular marketing, said in an interview last week.\n\nPradaxa inhibits thrombin, an enzyme in clot formation.

For visual references inside the brain or body, they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation.\n\nA growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time, without having to move them from the operating table.\n\nThe resulting real-time 3D visuals—known as “intraoperative imaging”—help surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy, reducing risks, such as nicked nerves from an errant knife, and the potential need for repeat surgery. The images also help surgeons spot bleeding, blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision.\n\nIntraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform “significantly better” than conventional surgery, says Sohail Mirza, medical director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system in Lebanon, N.H., affiliated with Dartmouth College’s medical school.\n\n“We still need a surgeon’s training and judgment,” Dr. Mirza says, “but we can use three-dimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and hand-eye coordination.” Dartmouth-Hitchcock opened the $20 million center last year with financing from a National Institutes of Health grant and its own funds. MRI and CT scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms.\n\nThe technology, first developed for use in complex brain surgeries, now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery, biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast, lung, prostate, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases.\n\nDoctors used real-time MRI and CT scan images to remove a complicated tumor last year from the spine of Jack Deliso, 9, center. With him are his parents, Lisa and Michael, and sisters Chloe, left, and Rigney. Photo: Michael Deliso\n\nThe real-time scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation, and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins. In radiation treatment, doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue. The images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight. Studies have found that in 40% of cases, brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative MRI scan.\n\n“This is precision medicine at its best, using an individual patient’s images to guide their procedure,” says Clare Tempany, co-director of the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating Suite program (known as Amigo) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The program is part of the hospital’s federally-funded National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its cost-effectiveness. Since Amigo opened in 2011, 700 patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breast-conserving tumor removal.\n\nThe need for more accuracy is real. As many as 40% of women who have breast-conserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain. At Brigham and Women’s researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons’ ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative MRI followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for re-operations.\n\nDr. Mirza says in the past, during spine surgeries, if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed, he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan. In some cases, he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery, or in other cases accept “slightly imperfect” results to avoid more cutting. Revisions, in addition to adding to the patient’s risks, use up costly operating room and staff time, he says.\n\nLast fall, Jack Deliso, then 8, needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk. An initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive. Dr. Mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon, David Bauer, proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure.\n\nJack’s parents, Michael and Lisa Deliso, were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery, his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired.\n\nThe technology was reassuring. “They explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the MRI while they were operating to make sure they got everything, without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor,” Mr. Deliso says.\n\nJack says he was calm going into surgery “because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it.” He was tired of lying awake at night, when he says he felt “excruciating pain.”\n\nDuring the 12-hour procedure, surgeons could see only the back of Jack’s spine. Because they didn’t know if the tumor was malignant, they were determined to avoid cutting into it, which could spread potentially cancerous cells elsewhere in the body. As they drilled into bones to detach and remove the tumor, they used a CT scan of the spine to help navigate accurately and avoid removing bone that wasn’t directly involved.\n\nNext, they performed an MRI to make sure the nerve roots were unscathed and they hadn’t missed any part of the mass. Toward the end of the procedure, they did a second CT scan, which showed there was enough bone left so Jack wouldn’t need reconstruction with rods, screws and bone grafts. They finished up and closed the incision.\n\nJack was in the hospital for three nights. A week later, pathology tests came back showing the tumor had been benign and the surgeons had gotten all of it. Now 9 years old, Jack says he would like to play soccer or football—and be an orthopedic surgeon when he grows up.\n\nIntraoperative scanning is costly for hospitals. For example, Imris Inc. of Canada makes Visius Surgical Theatre systems found in 87 operating rooms world-wide including at Brigham and Women’s and at Dartmouth. Each system consists of a two- or three-room suite with MRI units costing from about $3 million to $7 million, and CT scanners ranging from about $1.5 million to $3.5 million.\n\nJay Miller, president and chief executive, says over 17,000 procedures have been performed to date with Imris systems.\n\nIntraoperative imaging has its own risks, says Bernadette Henrichs, director of the nurse anesthesia program at Barnes-Jewish College and nurse anesthesia research and education at Washington University School of Medicine, both in St. Louis.\n\nBecause of the strong magnetic force used in MRI, ferrous metal objects and tools must be kept out of the operating room, along with pagers, cellphones, jewelry and hair pins. Anesthesia teams stay with patients during scans and use equipment such as aluminum oxygen tanks and instruments made from plastic, titanium and other materials compatible with MRI.\n\nAt Barnes-Jewish Hospital, OR teams get training before they can work with live MRI imaging. They do annual safety drills including emergency procedures in the event a patient has a cardiac arrest while undergoing a scan.\n\n“These are exciting advances, but we have to be vigilant in making sure patients and health-care workers aren’t harmed and take necessary safety precautions,” Ms. Hendrichs says.']","Another surgical technology story that is long on hypothetical benefits, but short on evidence, quantification, and harms. News organizations owe it to their readers to examine these issues more thoroughly.","The story provides an overview of techniques that incorporate computerized tomography (CT) scans and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into surgeries, giving surgeons “real-time” images of the patient and what is happening during the procedure. The idea is that such real-time imaging makes the surgeries more accurate and reduces the likelihood of repeated surgeries or complications. Though it quotes an expert who says the new technology allows surgeons to perform “significantly better” than with conventional surgery, the story never backs up that assertion. It offers very little information on whether these techniques are actually resulting in better health outcomes for patients or how far these techniques are from widespread adoption.

But in some people HPV leads to genital warts and cancers – notably, cervical cancer.\n\nThe vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix were designed as a prevention for young women who have not yet been exposed to HPV. Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine\'s safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\n\nThe experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water. It uses the immune system of the treated women to fight off cancer, said Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals and study co-author.\n\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with about 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, the study said. HPV causes about 5% of cancers globally.\n\nSome women, because of their particular genetic makeup, can clear precancerous lesions on their own and would not need this vaccine. This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said.\n\nNo one knows why some women have this capability and others do not, but for those who lack it the Inovio vaccine is ""giving our immune system a little boost,"" Kim said.\n\nEighteen women with high-grade precancerous cervical lesions participated in the phase 1 study.\n\nStudy authors say the vaccine is formulated to work against all cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical, anogenital (anal and genital), and head and neck cancers. The researchers did not observe any side effects.\n\nIn the next phase of this research 150 women worldwide are participating, but they are not included in these published results, Kim said.\n\nThe phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. The study was not done as a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than chance. Also, 18 people is a small number for examining the effects of a medication.\n\nGiven those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. Harper contributed to the studies on both HPV vaccines that are currently available, Cervarix and Gardasil, and is not involved with this research.\n\n“Several therapeutic vaccines have shown great promise in phase 1 and then not panned out in phase 2,” she noted in an e-mail.\n\nThe vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them.\n\nInovio is using this technology to develop vaccines for prostate cancer and HIV also, Kim said.\n\n“We certainly have a technology that can change the medical field by being able to program and generate strong immune responses that are specific and effective,” he said.\n\nKim said the next phase results should be out at the end of 2013; then comes a larger phase 3 trial with about 500 patients, to be concluded around 2016 or 2017.\n\nHPV is spread through genital contact, including oral sex, and partners can bounce the virus back and forth between them, making it harder to clear naturally. Kissing is not known to deliver this STD.']",This story outperformed the competing coverage by the ,"In either case, we question the newsworthiness of a Phase I study in 18 women.

CheckMate-025 is an example of how investigators are examining approved immunotherapy drugs to determine potential impact on other tumor types.\n\n""Immunotherapy has long been believed to have the potential to make an impact in kidney cancer, but until now we had not been able to demonstrate such a significant survival benefit. We have a real opportunity to change clinical practice for patients when other therapies have failed,"" said principal investigator Padmanee Sharma, MD, PhD, professor, Departments of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology and scientific director of the Immunotherapy Platform, part of MD Anderson\'s Moon Shots Program.\n\n""Through studies such as CheckMate-025, we are learning to target the patients\' immune systems to fight cancer rather than targeting the tumor itself. This is a new way forward.""\n\nIn the randomized phase III clinical trial, patients whose disease progressed on antiangiogenic therapies were treated with either nivolumab or everolimus. Median overall survival was 5.4 months longer with nivolumab (25 months) compared with everolimus (19.6 months).\n\nThe study included 821 patients with advanced RCC across 151 sites in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, South America and Asia. All had previously been treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies, drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels, a critical component of cancer development. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months with nivolumab and 3.7 months with everolimus.\n\nIn addition to demonstrating increased overall survival, the researchers showed a higher objective response rate - the number of patients who respond to the treatment - with nivolumab. Of the 821 patients enrolled, 25% responded to nivolumab versus 5% of those treated with everolimus.\n\nAmong these patients, partial responses were observed in 24% of those treated with nivolumab and 5% of patients treated with everolimus; complete responses were observed in 1% (four patients) treated with nivolumab and fewer than 1% (two patients) treated with everolimus.\n\nFurther, among patients who showed a response, the impact was ""durable,"" according to Sharma. While median progression-free survival appeared similar between treatments (4.6 months and 4.4 months with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively), when researchers explored a delayed progression-free survival benefit at six months, they reported 15.6 months with nivolumab and 11.7 months with everolimus. This ongoing response was observed among 44% of those treated with nivolumab and 36% of those treated with everolimus. More than 12 months later, 31% and 27% of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively, continued to show a response.\n\nFor some patients, even after treatment with nivolumab ended, response to the drug continued. ""The immune system has a memory, so even when treatment has stopped, the body continues to exhibit a long-term response - meaning these patients can live normal lives without progressive disease.""\n\nFinally, the investigators observed fewer treatment-related adverse events, including fatigue and nausea, and improved quality of life with nivolumab.\n\nTrial halted early; breakthrough therapy designation granted by FDA\n\nThese results led the trial to be halted early in July 2015 when an assessment conducted by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) concluded that the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival in patients receiving nivolumab.\n\nNivolumab blocks a T cell inhibitory signaling pathway known as PD-1 that controls the immune response and can prevent the immune system from attacking cancerous cells. The drug is approved for metastatic melanoma patients who show no response to other treatments and for advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after chemotherapy. Based on the CheckMate-025 findings, earlier this month (September 16) the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to nivolumab for the potential indication of metastatic RCC. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible.\n\n""The next questions are, \'how do we increase the number of patients who respond?\' and \'how do we move immune checkpoint agents into the frontline setting?\' - not just using them when other therapies have failed but intervening earlier,"" said Sharma. ""We\'re studying combination therapies to answer these questions and believe these studies will change the way we treat many cancers.""\n\nEach year, there are 338,000 new cases of RCC diagnosed worldwide; it is the most common type of kidney cancer among adults and approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis, according to the scientific literature. A number of targeted therapies have been approved in recent years for the treatment of advanced RCC, with five antiangiogenic and two mTOR inhibitors (including everolimus; these drugs block a protein that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, etc.), showing benefits in pivotal phase III trials.\n\n""While these treatments have changed the therapeutic landscape for RCC, they are associated with limited survival following emerging resistance to therapy,"" said Sharma. ""The overall survival benefit shown in this study sets a new benchmark for therapeutic strategies for advanced RCC patients in need of a second-line therapy.""\n\nSharma is scientific director of MD Anderson\'s immunotherapy platform, which provides immune monitoring expertise to MD Anderson\'s 85 clinical trials of immunotherapy drugs as single agents or in combinations. Platform investigators conduct research to understand which patients will benefit from immunotherapy, to evaluate effective drug combinations and to identify new molecules that block or stimulate immune response.\n\nThe platform is part of MD Anderson\'s Moon Shots Program, which is designed to harness scientific knowledge and develop new technologies that will dramatically reduce cancer deaths through prevention, early detection and treatment.\n\n###']","Although it has some notable strengths, this release misses some details that would help readers understand the risk/benefit tradeoff involved with this “Breakthrough Therapy.”","News releases from academic centers can fall victim to the hyperbole and excessive optimism often seen in the commercial realm. This release from MD Anderson Cancer Center avoids the worst excesses and we liked much of what was written, including the description of the study design and quantification of the survival benefit. But some important omissions are evident. We can perhaps forgive the release for not including a discussion of cost. But there were other significant deficiencies, including lack of a meaningful discussion on potential harms of the treatment, no mention of the study funding source, and no disclosure that the principal investigator (quoted extensively in the release) is a consultant to the manufacturer of nivolumab. These are important elements to help readers understand the true extent of this “breakthrough.”

Diet has been extensively studied as a modifiable risk factor in the development of breast cancer but epidemiologic evidence on the effect of specific dietary factors is inconsistent.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet is known for its abundance of plant foods, fish and especially olive oil. Miguel A. Martínez-González, M.D., of the University of Navarra in Pamplona and CIBEROBN in Madrid, Spain, and coauthors analyzed the effects of two interventions with the Mediterranean diet (supplemented with extra virgin olive oil [EVOO] or nuts) compared with advice to women to follow a low-fat diet. Study participants in the two intervention groups were given EVOO (one liter per week for the participants and their families) or mixed nuts (30 grams per day: 15 grams of walnuts, 7.5 grams of hazelnuts and 7.5 grams of almonds).\n\nThe study was conducted within the framework of the large PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) trial, which was designed to test the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2009, 4,282 women (ages 60 to 80 and at high risk of cardiovascular disease) were recruited. Women were randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO (n=1,476), the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts (n=1,285) or the control diet with advice to reduce their dietary intake of fat (n=1,391).\n\nThe women were an average age of 67.7 years old, had an average body mass index of 30.4, most of them had undergone menopause before the age of 55 and less than 3 percent used hormone therapy. During a median follow-up of nearly five years, the authors identified 35 confirmed incident (new) cases of malignant breast cancer.\n\nThe authors report that women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with EVOO showed a 68 percent (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.32) relatively lower risk of malignant breast cancer than those allocated to the control diet. Women eating a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts showed a nonsignificant risk reduction compared with women in the control group.\n\nThe authors note a number of limitations in their study including that breast cancer was not the primary end point of the trial for which the women were recruited; the number of observed breast cancer cases was low; the authors do not have information on an individual basis on whether and when women in the trial underwent mammography; and the study cannot establish whether the observed beneficial effect was attributable mainly to the EVOO or to its consumption within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\n""The results of the PREDIMED trial suggest a beneficial effect of a MeDiet [Mediterranean diet] supplemented with EVOO in the primary prevention of breast cancer. Preventive strategies represent the most sensible approach against cancer. The intervention paradigm implemented in the PREDIMED trial provides a useful scenario for breast cancer prevention because it is conducted in primary health care centers and also offers beneficial effects on a wide variety of health outcomes. Nevertheless, these results need confirmation by long-term studies with a higher number of incident cases,"" the authors conclude.\n\nEditor\'s Note: Can Diet Prevent Breast Cancer?\n\nIn a related editor\'s note, Mitchell H. Katz, M.D., a deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, writes: ""Of course, no study is perfect. This one has a small number of outcomes (only 35 incident cases of breast cancer), the women were not all screened for breast cancer with mammography, they were not blinded to the type of diet they were receiving, and all were white, postmenopausal and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, consumption of a Mediterranean diet, which is based on plant foods, fish and extra virgin olive oil, is known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and is safe. It may also prevent breast cancer. We hope to see more emphasis on Mediterranean diet to reduce cancer and cardiovascular disease and improve health and well-being.""\n\n###\n\n(JAMA Intern Med.

The study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which includes two patients, suggests fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy.\n\nThe research, led by Yinghong Wang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition and director of Medication Induced Colitis and Enteritis, was published today in Nature Medicine.\n\n“The resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after FMT treatment,” said Wang. “Based on these results, this should be evaluated even as a first-line therapy for ICI-associated colitis because it’s safe, quick, and the effect is durable - from one treatment.”\n\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors, which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer, have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types. However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities.\n\nColitis, inflammation of the colon, is the second most common side effect from ICIs, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, explained Wang. When ICI-associated colitis is severe, guidelines require a patient to stop ICI treatment until the colitis is in remission.\n\n“If the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy, that means you’ve taken their effective treatment away,” said Wang. “We have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ICI treatment, but I feel that we’ve made great progress in this area.”\n\nThe researchers chose to investigate the potential for FMT as an alternative, compassionate-use therapy for patients suffering from refractory, or unresponsive, ICI-associated colitis. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018.\n\nFMT has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases, such as recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ICI-associated colitis. These conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents, which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy.\n\nBoth patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. The first patient’s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single FMT treatment; the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment, followed by complete recovery after a second FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells.\n\nPre- and post-treatment stool analyses revealed patients’ gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment, with less resemblance to the donor over time. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome. Additionally, distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following FMT compared to pre-treatment samples, including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation.\n\nThe authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort, and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of FMT in treating ICI-associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy. FMT continues to be offered to MD Anderson patients on a compassionate-use basis.\n\nPrevious MD Anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ICI therapy, and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy. The current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ICI-colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly.\n\nThe study was supported by the Andrew Sabin Family Fellowship Program; the American Association for Cancer Research – Stand Up to Cancer; the National Institutes of Health (CA219896-01A1, HL124112); the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas; and the Melanoma Moon Shot™, part of MD Anderson’s Moon Shots Program™, a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save patients’ lives\n\nIn addition to Wang, other MD Anderson authors include: Diana Wiesnoski, Christopher Sanchez, and Chia-Chi Chang, Ph.D., all of Genomic Medicine; Beth Helmink, M.D., Ph.D., and Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan, Ph.D., both of Surgical Oncology; Hamzah Abu-Sbeih, M.D., Gottumukkala Raju, M.D., and John Stroehlein, M.D., all of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition; Edwin Parra, M.D., Ph.D., and Alejandro Francisco-Cruz, Ph.D., both of Translational Molecular Pathology; Matthew Campbell, M.D., Jianjun Gao, M.D., Ph.D., and Sumit Subudhi, M.D., Ph.D., all of Genitourinary Medical Oncology; Dipen Maru, M.D., of Pathology; Jorge Blando, DVM, and James Allison, Ph.D., both of Immunology; Padmanee Sharma, M.D., Ph.D., of Genitourinary Medical Oncology and Immunology; Michael Tetzlaff, M.D., Ph.D., of Translational Molecular Pathology and Pathology; Jennifer Wargo, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Surgical Oncology; and Robert Jenq, M.D., of Genomic Medicine and Stem Cell Transplantation.

While immunotherapy has taken the cancer treatment world by storm, the use of “immune checkpoint inhibitors” can produce debilitating side effects. In about 40% of patients, one of those side effects is severe inflammation of the colon, a problem that brings treatment to a halt until the colon clears up. In this preliminary, “proof-of-concept” study, a team of MD Anderson Cancer Center researchers found that fecal transplants returned the colons of two afflicted cancer patients to a healthy state.  While such results suggest that clinical trials will be a welcome next step, they don’t give oncologists or public information officers carte blanche to tout the effectiveness of the strategy.  Nature Medicine thought the small study deserved a spot in its “Brief Communication” section, but communication professionals at the cancer center should have taken a pass on this one and waited until more robust evidence becomes available.

But their results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit.\n\nThe study’s authors include Dr. Stephen Duffy, an epidemiologist at the University of London, and Dr. Laszlo Tabar, professor of radiology at the University of Uppsala School of Medicine in Sweden, who have long been advocates of mammography screening. Their paper is published online in the journal Cancer and will be presented on Friday at a meeting sponsored by the American Society for Clinical Oncology and five other organizations.\n\nThe study’s conclusions contrast with those of a report last year by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group that issues guidelines on cancer screening, questioning the benefit of screening women younger than 50.\n\nThe new study took advantage of circumstances in Sweden, where since 1986 some counties have offered mammograms to women in their 40s and others have not, according to the lead author, Hakan Jonsson, professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers compared breast cancer deaths in women who had a breast cancer diagnosis in counties that had screening with deaths in counties that did not.

This story includes strong comments from independent experts that can help readers get a broader understanding of the results of a study that compared breast cancer death rates among women in their 40s who lived in areas of Sweden that did or did not offer routine mammography. However, because the story reports only the percentage difference in death rates, without including absolute numbers or the number of women who need to be screened to prevent one death, readers may get the impression that the effect of mammography was larger than what the researchers actually reported.

There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.\n\nProf Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.\n\nSchoolgirls with autism share experiences in young adult novel Read more\n\n“The advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,” he said. “Our findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.\n\n“This is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.”\n\nThe trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.\n\nThe therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at UCL, said called the study ‘a remarkably positive story’. Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/Antonio Olmos\n\nOther experts applauded the work. “I can see why these researchers are excited,” said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.”\n\nDr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered “a hugely cheering message for families”, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it “a remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive”.\n\nThe absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children’s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.\n\n“Parents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,” said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. “Too often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.”\n\nThe researchers said children’s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.\n\nAbout 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe. The lifetime costs to the UK, which include health, social care and education costs as well as productivity losses, are estimated at £1m to £1.5m per child and between $1.4m and $2.4m in the United States.']","Although this study offers some promise that parental training and early intervention can help, care must be taken to reveal all of the findings and keep hyperbole out.","This article in The Guardian reports on a study showing that parents who undergo a training program designed to help them pay rigorous and constant attention to their pre-school autistic children’s communications cues consistently improves the children’s symptoms and behavior.
According to the article, the success of the Pre-school Autism Communication Trial (PACT), conducted by a team of British investigators “surprised even the researchers” who designed the six-year-long, randomized study of 152 children ages two to four with so-called “core” symptom  severe autism. It reports that this “new form” of therapy, one that is parent-child driven rather than therapist-child driven, is a “potential breakthrough” in efforts to moderate the repetitive behaviors, tantrums, outbursts and other core symptoms, and that all of the children whose parents got the training showed significant and measurable improvement at the end of the one-year intervention.
What the article fails to say, however, is that the main outcome measurement — improvement long term at a follow up evaluation after five years — did not show a statistically significant difference between the intervention group and a group whose parents got conventional “parent education.” The intervention group had better results than the control group immediately after the initial treatment period, but both groups had worsened somewhat at the long-term follow-up assessment. Although the intervention group results were still better, this difference could have been due to chance. It’s uncertain, therefore, whether the intervention clearly improves symptom scores more than conventional treatment.
That more cautionary detail should have made its way into the story. We did like that the story mentions this is by no means a cure, and that children will still need plenty of support growing up. But saying that researchers have found a “potential breakthrough” for results that might have been due to chance seems misleading.

The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.\n\nThirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.\n\nThe women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.\n\nAcupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.\n\n""The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,"" Mao said. ""The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.""\n\nThe results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that ""there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,"" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.""\n\nDeng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. ""In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,"" he said. ""The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they\'re getting something.""\n\nNo one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. ""It\'s like psychotherapy,"" he added. ""Why does it work for some people and not others?"" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said ""there is a fertile field for further research.""\n\nSome patients might wonder if acupuncture that\'s helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.\n\nHowever, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. ""Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,"" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.\n\nOne big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.\n\nBut should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?\n\n""For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what\'s most appropriate for them,"" Deng said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health for more on acupuncture.']","Adequate but not outstanding, this report on a trial of hot flash treatments did some things very well and left room for improvement in other areas.","This story is about a small but intriguing study that tests four different methods to manage the kind of hot flashes experienced by women who have been treated for breast cancer. Testing acupuncture, “sham” acupuncture, the drug gabapentin and a placebo pill, it found that real acupuncture was better than the other three. The story includes plenty of interesting commentary on the placebo effect and its role in the treatment of hot flashes. It would have benefited from a bit more detail on what acupuncture and ‘sham’ acupuncture entails, some sense of the magnitude of effects from these treatments, and an explanation of potential study limitations.

The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge.\n\n""We have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation,"" say Dr. Peter Kavsak, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, ""This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.""\n\nPatients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.\n\nIn this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization\'s list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.\n\nThe researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.\n\nThe authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.\n\n""Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors. This could result in the safest laboratory approach for physicians to use at presentation in the emergency department,"" says Dr. Kavsak.\n\n###\n\nThe Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded the study with reagent support from Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics.\n\n""Clinical chemistry score versus high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and T tests alone to identify patients at low or high risk for myocardial infarction or death at presentation to the emergency department"" is published August 20, 2018.']",This release highlights the new scoring system’s high sensitivity — a plus — but neglects to mention potential harm from false positive results which could lead to unnecessary treatments.,"Possible heart attack symptoms require a physician’s attention, but determining who is actually having a heart attack and who is not is challenging.  A global research team combined three commonly used tests into a single laboratory score that appears to do a better job of differentiating between higher and lower heart attack risk than do other diagnostic efforts.  The news release does a nice job of describing the validation study but could have offered more detail about the make-up of the scoring system and about possible conflicts of interest among the researchers.

And there were ""signals"" that it was slowing down two of the patients\' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University\'s Wexner Medical Center.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson\'s disease and certain other brain disorders.\n\nBut it\'s far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer\'s, Scharre stressed.\n\n""This is not ready for prime time,"" he said. ""It\'s not something patients can ask their neurologist for.""\n\nKeith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer\'s Association, agreed.\n\nIt\'s ""much too early"" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.\n\nInstead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is ""a reasonable route"" to study in larger clinical trials.\n\nThe results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.\n\nDeep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a ""brain pacemaker,"" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain ""circuits.""\n\nThe theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer\'s patients, Scharre said, is similar to the ""use it or lose it"" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.\n\nRight now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer\'s target brain chemicals involved in memory.\n\nBut Alzheimer\'s impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.\n\nSo, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer\'s and were on standard medications.\n\nAfter starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer\'s research database.\n\nTwo of the DBS patients declined at a ""meaningfully"" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.\n\nThat patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she\'d regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.\n\nIn a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer\'s has progressed, but more slowly than he\'d expected.\n\n""LaVonne has had Alzheimer\'s disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it\'s really a positive thing because it shows that we\'re doing something right,"" Moore said.\n\nIf DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer\'s, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.\n\nIt would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.\n\nIn the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.\n\nThere is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.\n\nWhat\'s needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.\n\nOn a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: ""Alzheimer\'s disease is more than just amnesia.""\n\nFor caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging. So any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome.\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\'s -- a number that could rise to 16 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\'s Association.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Association offers resources for caregivers.']","To its credit, the story cautions that this is not anywhere close to being a readily available treatment.","This story reports on a “proof of concept” study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to improve behavioral and cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients, which involves implanting an electrical pulse generator under the skin to alter brain activity.
To its credit, the story cautions that this is not anywhere close to being a readily available treatment. However, it neglects significant potential harms of using an implantable device and isn’t completely clear on the lack of a proven benefit. We think this study was one of those that isn’t quite ready for a consumer news audience; it’s just too preliminary and has the potential to stoke false hope.

""We do not want to give anyone false hopes that this is ready for the clinic yet. This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,"" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.\n\nUsing the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.\n\nThe study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior – that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.\n\nCurrently there\'s no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)\n\nThe earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can\'t move during the test).\n\nCarissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. But she cautions that using this method as a true diagnostic tool to detect autism in a child is ""a long way off."" ""What this paper seems to be doing is taking the first steps towards parlaying what we are able to glean from brain imaging into potential diagnostic tools.""\n\nZachary Warren, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), says since there are many types of autism, ""it becomes very challenging to capture all these differences with one test."" Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.']","<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">This was the better of two stories (</span></span>","Both stories relied on journalism tropes.

The story follows through with this more cautious lead by presenting a better — if not complete — analysis of the evidence and using independent sources to bring some much needed perspective on the findings.

Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.\n\nThe research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies’ long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.\n\nSurprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it’s interrupted by a surgical birth.\n\nThe new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.\n\nDr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section “are missing out on.”\n\n“Our thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,” Dr. Black said.\n\nEven attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.\n\n“When you don’t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,” said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “What is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?”\n\nStudies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Scottish study took advantage of the small country’s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.\n\nThe researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.\n\nOver all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.\n\nThe biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.\n\nAll of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.\n\nAlthough all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.\n\nNo one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby’s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.\n\nThe step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.\n\nDuring labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe theory is that maternal microbes “train” the infant’s immune system, so it doesn’t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.\n\n“It’s an education process that says, ‘Calm down, you’re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don’t have to be so aggressive,’” Dr. Neu said.\n\nDr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.\n\nChildbirth and labor are “a physiological process that we’ve evolved to over millions of years,” Dr. Caughey said. “It’s been really well-designed by evolution.”\n\nRelated:']","Despite a 4-star score, this story lets readers down in some important ways, first by not adequately explaining the small size of the effect and by not addressing some key limitations.","In this story, we hear about a long-term comparison of three kinds of birth in Scotland: planned C-section, unplanned C-section and vaginal delivery. This enormous observational study included more than 320,000 children, and followed their health for many years. There was a slight increase in risk of Type 1 diabetes between the scheduled and unscheduled C-sections, which the story uses as a window for interviews with experts about speculation on how vaginal birth benefits babies. But the story misses key points about baseline differences in the women giving birth in three ways, which may have impacted the findings. Additionally, the story only discusses the increased risk (from the hazard ratios given) in relative percent increase, not absolute increase. This results in a misleading description of the findings and the size of the risk. Moreover, the study itself carefully warns that the results don’t prove any causation between the style of birth and the risk. Some readers of the story may mistakenly believe that the limited results prove causation.

Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nIn the study, Sapkota\'s team tested the saliva of 22 people with Alzheimer\'s disease, 25 people with what\'s known as mild cognitive impairment (a decline in memory and thinking that\'s sometimes a precursor to dementia), as well as 35 people whose mental skills were normal for their age.\n\nThey found that the saliva of people with Alzheimer\'s had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment.\n\nExperts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed.\n\n""This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive,"" said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nShe believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as ""coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables"" that could influence what\'s found in the saliva samples.\n\n""There are many gaps in the evidence,"" Reiss said. ""It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer\'s risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.""\n\nStill, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research ""is still in its infancy but very promising.""\n\nIf a saliva test lives up to its promise, one advantage is ""the ease of obtaining a sample,"" he said.\n\nBut that convenience also brings its own problems, Wright added. People might ask for a test even when they don\'t show any signs of dementia, and ""this may result in anxiety and depression if there is a false positive result,"" he said.\n\nFor that reason, ""larger studies are needed to corroborate and validate their findings,"" Wright said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about Alzheimer\'s disease.']","The tone of this story is appropriately calibrated to the preliminary nature of the evidence on offer, with good discussion of study limitations.","This story discusses a small study from the University of Alberta in Canada that looked for differences in the saliva of Alzheimer’s patients, individuals that have shown some mild cognitive impairment, and those whose mental skills are normal for their age.  An analysis of the saliva from these three distinct groups showed specific differences in certain compounds present.  The suggestion is that, if shown to be correct in a much larger controlled trial, a simple saliva test might offer an early warning for those people at higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s.
This story does a nice job of clarifying the small, preliminary nature of the study and describing its significant limitations. It also acknowledges that even a noninvasive saliva test has the potential to cause harm — context that’s not often provided with stories of diagnostic/screening studies.

Mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake. Additionally, some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane, an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation.\n\n""This is the first study to demonstrate positive vascular effects of mango intake in humans,"" said lead researcher Robert Hackman, with the UC Davis Department of Nutrition. He presented the findings today at the American Society for Nutrition annual meeting, Nutrition 2018, in Boston. ""Our results build on previous animal and cell studies that point to the potential benefits of mangos to promote health.""\n\nMangos contain a mix of polyphenols, including mangiferin, quercetin, gallotannins, and gallic acid, that have been the focus of previous investigations exploring the potential health-protecting properties of mangos. Li and colleagues believe the concentration of these bioactive compounds in mangos may be responsible for the favorable response.\n\nMethodology and Results\n\nIn the study, 24 healthy postmenopausal women consumed 330 grams (2 cups) of mango daily for 14 days. The honey mango (also referred to as Ataulfo) was chosen for the study due to the high concentration of polyphenols in this popular variety.\n\nFollowing the 14 days of mango consumption, the study participants resumed their normal daily diet but eliminated mango intake for 13 days. Measurements were taken during each visit, including heart rate and blood pressure, blood samples and breath samples, which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status.\n\nAt the start of the study, blood pressure was not significantly different between the study visits. Yet once mango was consumed, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower two hours after mango intake compared to baseline values. Pulse pressure was also significantly reduced two hours after eating mango.\n\nSystolic blood pressure (the upper number in blood pressure readings) indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic (bottom number) in blood pressure readings. Pulse pressure can be used as an indicator of heart health.\n\nBreath levels of hydrogen and methane were measured, which reflect the amount of these gases that were produced due to microbial fermentation in the intestinal tract. Some study participants produced hydrogen, some produced methane, and others produced both gases or neither of them. Six of the 24 participants produced methane, and of these six, three shown significant reduction after consuming mango, which is considered a favorable outcome for gut health.\n\nThe researchers conclude that mangos may be a heart-healthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Longer-term studies involving other population groups are warranted.\n\n###\n\nThe research was supported in part by funds from the National Mango Board and USDA.\n\nSource: Li X, Vanness MA, Holt RR, Horn WF, Keim NL, Keen CL, Hackman RM. Effects of two weeks of daily mango fruit intake on vascular function, blood pressure and gut fermentation in healthy adult women. The FASEB Journal, June 2018.']","Without a control group in the study to prove otherwise, it’s possible the consumption of two cups of any fruit, or even any food, may affect systolic blood pressure.","The news release focuses on a small, short-term study of healthy women that found consuming two cups of mango a day was associated with reduced systolic blood pressure. However, it is not clear how much the systolic blood pressure was reduced or how the researchers accounted for normal, daily variations in blood pressure. The release also neglects to note how mango consumption would fit into other approaches that can be taken by healthy adults to maintain healthy blood pressure.
Without a control group in the study to prove otherwise, it’s possible the consumption of two cups of any fruit, or even any food, may affect systolic blood pressure. And the phenomenon of post prandial (after eating) drops in blood pressure are very real and affect a significant percentage of the population, especially the elderly. Consequently, it would be quite important to see the impact of consumption of two cups of anything on systolic blood pressure before concluding that it was the mangoes.

It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.\n\nAn editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”.\n\nThe various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.\n\nRival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.\n\nKeytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.\n\nLead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”.\n\nU.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.\n\nMerck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.\n\nCOMBINATION THERAPY\n\nThe second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.\n\nMany experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low.\n\nIn the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.\n\nPatients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.\n\nRoger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.\n\nDrugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.\n\nThey are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.\n\nUp until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.\n\nThe current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nResults of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.\n\nThese showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.\n\nThe failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.\n\nMany now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.']","The story shares the seemingly good news for lung cancer patients without noting that the drug under investigation only amounted to a few extra months of cancer not spreading, compared to standard treatment.","lung cancer illustration
Non-small cell lung cancer is a hard disease to treat.  A newer immunotherapy drug developed by Merck & Co and called Keytruda—which activates a patient’s immune system to fight the disease—has been shown in a clinical trial to stop the disease’s progression for a longer period of time than does standard chemotherapy treatment, but only in a select group of patients with certain biomarkers.  A smaller clinical trial that gave patients (without biomarkers) both drug and chemotherapy treatments and also shrank tumors and slowed disease progression is heralded as the first to demonstrate the relative efficacy of that combination.
This Reuters story shares this good news but didn’t explain the specifics: That Keytruda halted cancer progression by only about four months compared to the chemo group. It also didn’t state how much those extra months will impact the patient–financially and in quality of life; adverse events in the trials are glossed over.
Lastly, its “new day” headline and overall optimistic tone may mislead some people into thinking the drug offers lengthy survival (or even a cure) for anyone with this type of often-lethal cancer; instead this reference is to the fact that patients will now get tested for certain genetic biomarkers to see if immunotherapy is the better targeted therapy. How many people with this type of cancer have these biomarkers–and will therefore benefit–isn’t stated.

In effect, you’re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.\n\nNow, by this latest study’s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of “fair” or “good” quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.\n\nSuffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.\n\nBut the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people’s pain.\n\nWhat the study found\n\nFor the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as “very low” in quality and methodology.\n\nResearchers then identified the studies — none of which were graded as “good” quality — that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the “fair-quality” studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.\n\nThe authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, “such as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.” It’s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what’s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, “a paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.”\n\nOr, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation — “that is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.”\n\nThe findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers — a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.\n\nCrucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.\n\nAs the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality — meaning there’s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it’s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.\n\n“We should be cautious in interpreting the findings,” Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill “important gaps” in our knowledge. He added, “I want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.”\n\nA few pain patients will still benefit from opioids\n\nOne of the study’s implications is that opioids actually aren’t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn’t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.\n\nThat does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.\n\nAs addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. And so on.\n\nIn a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.\n\nThis, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.\n\n“There are people who do well with tapering [opioids],” Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. “There are people who do not do well with tapering.”\n\nBut the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it — and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.\n\nAlternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible\n\nThe reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not — particularly in rural areas — be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.\n\nThis is something the study’s authors readily acknowledge.\n\n“It’s an important part of this challenge,” Frank said. “These non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.”\n\nIn fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer — if ultimately an ineffective one — to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn’t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient’s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)\n\nTo address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.\n\nThese solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn’t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed — or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)\n\n“Not only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,” Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. “One day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.”\n\nOpioid policy is a balancing act\n\nThe findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.\n\nIt’s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs — even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.\n\nThere’s good evidence this happened to many — but not all — opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.\n\nThe fundamental problem is many of these patients don’t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users’ only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn’t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.\n\nBut the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care — and it frequently hasn’t been.\n\nBeyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.\n\n“Who is at higher risk — John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?” Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, “it’s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.”\n\nBut as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients — showing just another way that the US health care system isn’t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.\n\nAll of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn’t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn’t really need.']","Readers are expertly walked through the study’s weaknesses as well as an important related issue: The troubles of trying to treat people for chronic pain without using opioids, and how access to such care is problematic.","This story tackles a study that rounded up dozens of small studies to probe the effectiveness of painkiller “tapering:” a slow, gradual weaning of opioid painkillers for those who are addicted to the drugs. The story is much more than that, however, as it lays out some the core issues with the U.S. opioid epidemic, which gives the study crucial context and potential meaning.
Readers are expertly walked through the study’s weaknesses as well as an important related issue: The troubles of trying to treat people for chronic pain without using opioids, and how access to such care is problematic.

At 59 years old she was 5 foot 2 and weighed 360 pounds. That\'s when she opted for bariatric surgery.\n\nThe surgery worked. Friedman, who is now 70 and lives in Los Angeles, lost 175 pounds. ""It was a miracle,"" Friedman says, not to feel hungry. ""It was the first time in my life that I\'ve ever lost a lot of weight and was able to maintain it.""\n\nFriedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. But then to her dismay she started to gain it back. ""I thought I was cured,"" she says. ""I thought I could eat like regular people.""\n\nShe\'s not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases.\n\nAbout one in three patients regain significant amounts of weight a few years after surgery to reduce the size of the stomach pouch. Bariatric surgery shrinks the stomach to about the size of an egg, so people feel full from eating very little food. The problem is that over the years the stomach stretches, and when that happens, Watson says, ""Patients are able to eat more at one sitting and they feel hungrier more often.""\n\nAt the same time, hormonal changes that reduce the appetite and take effect immediately after the surgery begin to decline. Watson says we don\'t know for sure, but it\'s possible the body begins to adapt to those changes, which is why the weight loss is reversed over time.\n\nFor Fran Friedman, it meant a 20-pound weight gain and a bout of depression. ""The reality hits,"" she says. ""Do I want to go back to where I was or do I want to maintain this level of quality of life?""\n\nSo Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. It\'s called Transoral Outlet Reduction – or TORe for short. It\'s one of several procedures designed to help people maintain the benefits of bariatric surgery. This procedure involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth into the stomach while the patient is under anesthesia. It costs $8,000 to $13,000 and insurance coverage varies.\n\nIf the stomach pouch has stretched, new sutures are put in place to once again reduce the size of the stomach. After the surgery, Watson says, patients report feeling fuller and less hungry and they ultimately gain greater control over what they are eating. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works. There are no significant side effects to the surgery, and patients can return to work the day after they have the procedure.\n\nFor Friedman, it did the trick. She has lost 30 pounds since her second surgery. And now, she says, with the help of a support group she is recommitted to watching what she eats and how much she exercises. She wants to lose another 20 pounds. And more importantly, she wants to keep the weight off.']",Tackling a very interesting topic — weight regain after bariatric surgery — this story could’ve used a bit more scrutiny of the evidence that underlies the claims.,"There were some bright spots in the coverage — the discussion of costs was particularly welcome — but overall this story provides the reader with an incomplete picture of the value of TORe surgery. A single patient anecdote is used as the basis for the majority of the claims. And while a link to a supporting study abstract is provided, the story gives no analysis of the findings and lacks key details such as the study design, the number of patients, and the true burden of the side effects of the procedure.

To alleviate symptoms, steam inhalation and nasal irrigation are widely suggested as an alternative to common treatment with antibiotics, which are often not effective and contribute to antibiotic resistance.\n\nResearchers from the United Kingdom conducted a randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of advice from primary care physicians to use nasal irrigation and/or steam inhalation for chronic sinusitis. The study involved 871 patients from 72 primary care practices in England who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 advice strategies: usual care, daily nasal and saline irrigation supported by a demonstration video, daily steam inhalation, or combined treatment with both interventions.\n\n""We have found that even a very brief intervention of a video showing patients how to use saline nasal irrigation can improve symptoms, help people feel they do not need to see the doctor to manage the problem, and reduce the amount of over-the-counter medication they need to use,"" said Dr. Paul Little, Primary Care and Population Sciences Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\n\nPatients who were instructed to use nasal irrigation showed improvement at 3 and 6 months, as measured by the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index.

""Although there was no significant difference in either physician visits or antibiotic use, as might be expected over only a 6-month follow-up period, our findings concerning consultations are important in the longer term, given antibiotic use increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance.""\n\nSince the impact was less than in previous studies that had used more intensive coaching about nasal irrigation, the authors suggest that further research is needed to understand how much coaching of patients is required.\n\n###']",Some numbers putting the benefits in context would have aided this release from the Canadian Medical Association.,"In this randomized controlled study of 871 patients, researchers found a slight improvement (44.1% for users of nasal irrigation vs. 36.6% for those using another treatment method) based on a measurement of clinical and self-reported symptoms from patients with sinus infections who were given instructions in how to use a salt solution to wash the inside of their nostrils.
Patient volunteers in the study were assigned to one of four groups: those receiving a nasal irrigation solution, steam, a combination of steam and nasal irrigation and “usual care” which referred to medications or referral, at the discretion of the physician. The study found that after six months there was a very modest decrease among nasal irrigation users in the use of over-the-counter medications (59.4% v. 68.0%) and those intending to seek medical consultation for symptom relief in the future.

They also believe improved diets have significantly cut diabetes and heart disease, and even slightly trimmed cancer cases.\n\nThe findings paint a surprising picture of American health. But study author Dong Wang, a graduate student with the departments of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it\'s not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating.\n\n""The overall American diet is still poor,"" he said. ""Huge room exists for further improvement.""\n\nThe researchers wanted to understand how changes in the American diet in the 21st century affected health over time. To get insight into the answer, they analyzed the results of seven health and nutrition surveys including almost 34,000 adults aged 20 and older between 1999 and 2012.\n\nThe researchers ranked diets on a healthy eating scale from 0 (poor diet) to 110 (perfect diet). From 1999 to 2012, the overall rating increased, from 40 to 48.\n\nOn the positive side, over time, Americans ate more fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes and polyunsaturated fatty acids, Wang said. They also ate less trans fats, sugar-sweetened beverages and juice, and red and processed meat. But the intake of salt actually went up.\n\nThe researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that the improvement in diets prevented over one million premature deaths and lowered heart disease cases by almost 9 percent, type 2 diabetes cases by nearly 13 percent and cancer cases by just over 1 percent.\n\nAccording to Wang, the study findings suggest that healthier diets lower the risk of death in a variety of ways. Among other things, improved diets appear to lower the risk of chronic diseases and boost the survival of people who have those conditions. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said.\n\nThe study authors didn\'t analyze whether their estimates match up to actual death rates in the United States. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said.\n\nDr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it\'s ""reasonable"" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way. But, she said, nutrition research like this has limitations because it relies on people\'s memories of what they ate. As a result, she said, it\'s crucial to look at a variety of studies and see if trends hold up.\n\nAccording to study author Wang, trans fats have been almost eliminated from the food supply, so what is needed next is more taxation on sugary drinks and more regulations requiring salt to be reduced in food.\n\nHe also said the government can do more to improve diets for the poor, who haven\'t seen the same level of improvements as other groups. One option, he said, is to increase the number of farmers markets that accept food stamps.\n\nThe study is published in the November issue of Health Affairs.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about healthy eating, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.']","Though it has many strengths, this story should have pushed back against the the claim that one million lives have been saved by better diets. This type of study can’t tell us that.","This news story ably describes a Harvard research team’s effort to evaluate the quality of American diets over time using a composite index of food choices that reflect adherence — or lack thereof — to diets predicted to lower the population risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. The story does a pretty good job of explaining a mind-numbingly complicated collection of disparate data, as well as the research team’s overall conclusion: that improvements in U.S. diet between 1999 and 2012 — notably reduction in trans fats and red meat consumption, along with increased consumption of fruits, nuts and whole grains — may have pushed down the rates of premature deaths and chronic disease burden, although doing little to raise the overall “health” of the American diet. But the story swallows a bit too easily the claim that better diets “have saved more than one million people from dying prematurely.” While that’s certainly possible, the claim is based on modeling from observational studies that can’t prove cause and effect — so it’s inappropriate to suggest, based on these types of studies, that dietary changes “saved” anyone. These are associations but not proof that diets reduced death rates. In addition, the story could have been strengthened by a bit more emphasis on racial and socioeconomic disparities in the improvement rates; by adding some information about the links between public policy and dietary choices; and by delving a little deeper into the study’s limitations, which are outlined in substantial detail by the investigators.

Similar to another WebMD report we reviewed that was also about an article in the Archives of Internal Medicine, this one appears to be cribbed from the journal’s news release.

The story then leaps to the unfounded interpretation that the study results show eating foods rich in antioxidants fights disease. The story fails to point out that this sort of observational study cannot prove cause-and-effect.  (Read our primer on this topic.)

They have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients. This early clinical work is presented at the ECNP conference in Paris on Tuesday 5th September, with later publication in Schizophrenia Bulletin*.\n\n""This is the first controlled trial to precisely determine an anatomically defined brain area where high frequency magnetic pulses can improve the hearing of voices"", said lead researcher, Professor Sonia Dollfus (University of Caen, CHU, France).\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious long-term mental health problem. People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be \'heard\' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.\n\nTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.\n\nThe French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)\n\nAfter 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded (\'significant response\' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).\n\nProfessor Sonia Dollfus said: ""Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or ""hearing voices"" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term"".\n\nCommenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: ""This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important. While response rates were moderate, TMS is a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire especially for patients who do not respond to medication.""\n\nNOTE: The full title of this release is ""Scientists discover brain area which can be targeted for treatment in patients with schizophrenia who \'hear voices\'"" It has been shortened in some versions to comply with Eurekalert title limits.\n\n*This work has been accepted in the peer-reviewed journal Schizophrenia Bulletin: The Journal of Psychoses and Related Disorders. The exact publication date has still to be determined.\n\nNote: Around 220,000 people have been diagnosed as having schizophrenia in England and Wales (https:/ / www. rcpsych. ac. uk/ pdf/ NAS%20National%20report%20FINAL. pdf )\n\n###']",But readers would have been better served if the release had been sent after the relevant research was also publicly available.,"The release focuses on research presented at a conference that found a third of patients who have schizophrenia and experience auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) — meaning they hear voices — responded favorably to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of a specific region of the brain. The release notes that the finding is valuable for two reasons: because it points to a specific region of the brain associated with AVHs in schizophrenia patients; and because it is a controlled trial for a treatment technique that has been discussed for years but was lacking clinical evidence one way or the other.
The release does a fair job of articulating the importance of the new findings and placing them in context. However, more information on related costs and risks would be valuable. More importantly, the release refers to research that is not published, and is therefore not yet publicly available. The public would be better served if the release had been pushed out only when the relevant research was also publicly available, so that interested parties — including healthcare professionals — could assess the research itself.

Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).\n\nDr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.\n\nWhile endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach\'s volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.\n\nThe team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.\n\nWhen examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.\n\n""For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,"" added Dr. Sharaiha. ""Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they\'ve been looking for. It\'s less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.""\n\nObesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than one in three U.S. adults is obese, having a body mass index of 30 or more. The CDC estimated the medical cost of obesity in the U.S. at approximately $147 billion in 2008.

But you can\'t make any conclusions about definite health benefits"" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.\n\nThe study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.\n\nGinger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it\'s ""likely safe,"" although some people may develop mild side effects.\n\nPrevious research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn\'t potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.\n\nIn the new study, Zick\'s team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a ""dummy"" placebo pill each day for 28 days.

But for now, she said, ""if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead,"" but there\'s no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.\n\nDr. Andrew Chan, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said the findings are promising because they hint at how ginger may prevent colon cancer.\n\nIt\'s already clear that people with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of colon cancer, he noted.

Some detected tumors do not become dangerous, and some treatments have harmful side effects.\n\nRegular screenings prevented one death per 1,904 women screened from age 40 to 49. The panel also said women ages 50 to 74 needed mammograms only every two years instead of every year.\n\nMany doctors responded that early detection is key and that no tool is better for earliest detection than the mammogram.\n\nThe question at hand, Hardesty said, is: “If it’s your cancer, and your life, it’s huge, but where are we willing to spend that money?”\n\nResearchers immediately started recording changes caused by the revised guidelines. Hardesty’s patient study started with the fact that 1,327 women in the 40-49 age group sought mammograms at University Hospital in a nine-month period before the guidelines; afterward, the numbers dropped by 205.\n\nThe recession and loss of work-based insurance might explain some decline, Hardesty said, but women in the 50-74 age group had a slight increase.\n\nHealth care cost-reform efforts depend in part on increased funding for evidence-based treatment reviews, which evaluate the effectiveness of everything from antibiotics to spinal procedures to prostate screening.\n\nBut guidelines lead to fears that insurers or governments won’t pay for certain tests and procedures — words such as “rationing” stirred the 2009-10 federal reform debate.\n\n“We want to have the best science out there. We want to have evidence-based practices, but I think this has caused more damage than good,” said Michele Ostrander, executive director of the Denver branch of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nThe revised guidelines “didn’t say, ‘Don’t get a mammogram,’ but that’s what the public heard,” according to the new research, Ostrander said.\n\nColorado advocates said they had not seen evidence that payers were trying to cut out mammograms after the study. The state legislature passed a law last year requiring Colorado insurers to pay for mammograms every year past age 40.\n\nThe cancer-treatment community will watch closely for more studies, said Dr. Colleen Murphy, director of the breast-cancer program at Porter Adventist Hospital.\n\n“I haven’t met too many providers who think these guidelines are a good idea,” Murphy said. “Hopefully there will be more research that supports that side of things.”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is the kind of one-sided reporting on the US Preventive Services Task Force’s mammography recommendations that has occurred so often since November 2009.

Inexplicably, the story includes no response from the Task Force itself.  So a clear imbalance exists in the story. 
Indeed, a flip side to the story that there’s a decline in 40-year old women getting mammograms is that this is a good thing.  But the story never even hints at that possibility.  When given the choice, one of these studies suggests that most women in their 40s continue with mammograms.  The shared decision-making angle to the story is missed.

REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili\n\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania engineered patients’ own pathogen-fighting T-cells to target a molecule found on the surface of leukemia cells.\n\nThe altered T-cells were grown outside of the body and infused back into patients suffering from late-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which affects the blood and bone marrow and is the most common form of leukemia.\n\nTwo participants in the Phase I trial have been in remission for up to a year. A third had a strong anti-tumor response, and his cancer remains in check. The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial.\n\n“We put a key onto the surface of the T-cells that fits into a lock that only the cancer cells have,” said Dr. Michael Kalos, director of translational and correlative studies at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and an investigator on the study.\n\nThe results provide “a tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,” including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said.\n\nThe findings were published simultaneously Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine.\n\nKalos said past efforts to use the technique, known as “adoptive T-cell transfer,” failed either because the T-cell response was too weak or proved too toxic for normal tissue.\n\nNEW METHODOLOGY\n\nThe technique differs from other cancer therapies designed to harness the body’s own immune system to fight tumors — such as therapeutic cancer vaccines.\n\n“We are saying forget about stimulating an immune response. We are going to give you an immune response,” Kalos said.\n\nThe treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. The leukemia patients in the Phase I trial had to be treated with an immunity-boosting drug since the targeted molecule, CD-19, is also present on certain normal immune-system cells.\n\nTo deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. It was used to carry a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD-19 coupled with receptors for two other components of T-cell activity.\n\nAbout two weeks after the gene therapy, patients began to experience “tumor lysis syndrome” — chills, nausea and fever — caused by the break-down products of dying cancer cells.\n\nThe engineered T-cells were detected in patients’ blood for several months afterward, and a portion of them turned into “memory T-cells,” which could provide ongoing protection against cancer recurrence, researchers surmised.\n\nDr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland Oregon cautioned that continued presence of activated T-cells and memory cells might be more of a problem in other types of cancer where toxic effects on normal tissue could be more severe.\n\nIn addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.\n\n“One of the big questions is ... will those persistent T-cells continue to work and prevent that tumor from coming back,” said Urba, who was not involved in the study.\n\nAll of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania’s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive.\n\n“We are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,” Kalos said.\n\nFurther study will show whether the latest results “reflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,” Urba said in an NEJM editorial.""]","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story – and one <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4205"" target=""_blank"">by WebMD</a> – were better <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/2011/08/striking-contrasts-of-hype-versus-rational-reporting-in-leukemia-story.html"" target=""_blank"">than many others we saw</a> as we looked around the media landscape. </span>", ,4,real

Might non-opioid painkillers work just as well as these addictive drugs?\n\nThis study\n\nThe study involved 416 adults (average age, 37) who had gone to an emergency department with an extremity injury causing moderate to severe pain (averaging 8.7 on a scale of 1 to 10).\n\nFor pain, they were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen along with a non-opioid — ibuprofen — or with one of three commonly prescribed opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.\n\nWithin two hours, all participants reported essentially identical declines in pain, about four points on the scale. Even for people who initially had rated their pain as a 10 (for the worst pain possible) or had broken a bone, there was virtually no difference in pain reduction between those who had and had not taken an opioid.\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nAdults with arm or leg pain caused by a sprain, strain or fracture. Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs — partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.\n\nCaveats\n\nData on pain came from the participants\' ratings; no information on side effects was collected.

One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain.
The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers.

This story about how the shingles vaccine performs in the real world takes a somewhat different tack from the HealthDay and Reuters stories we also reviewed.

The story covers many of the basic points on the effectiveness study, though readers are not told what is new and different about this study compared to earlier research. There is a good description of who was included in this study, but little attention to the potential sources of bias inherent in this sort of observational study. In addition to reporting the 55 percent reduction in relative risk and the absolute risk reduction (6 versus 13 cases per 1,000 people per year), we wish this story had noted that the study found that 71 people need to be vaccinated in order to prevent one from having a shingles attack.

The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate — or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n“It reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,” Crawford said. “If you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.”\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco.\n\n“If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,” Crawford said.\n\nThe test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.']",This is one of many stories coming out of the annual American Urological Association meeting.  But the story focused entirely on what a researcher said at this meeting – without shedding any light on what’s been learned from four years of approved use of the test already in Europe.  ," This story reported on a diagnostic test for prostate cancer, indicating how its use improved the ability to distinguish prostate cancer from other prostate issues.  Although it mentioned that the test has been approved for use in Europe since 2006 but not in the US, it didn’t tell us why.  Has the company not submitted it for approval here yet?  What, if any, concerns have been raised?

REUTERS/© 2005 Terese Winslow, U.S. Govt. has certain rights/Handout\n\nThe study sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute is the first to show that people can be screened for lung cancer, akin to mammograms for breast cancer and tests for colon and prostate cancer.\n\n“Nothing has ever shown a 20 percent decrease in mortality in this disease ever before. This is huge,” said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership.\n\nThe researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the “spiral” CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread.\n\n“To me this is a game changer,” Vidaver said in a telephone interview. “We will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors.”\n\nThe researchers have some caveats. They do not know whether the radiation from the CT scans may raise the risk of cancer, and they do not know what the study means for light smokers, younger people, or those who have never smoked.\n\nIt is also possible the scans will turn up tumors that would never have killed the patients, and that some people will undergo unnecessary surgery if they are screened.\n\nIt is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.\n\nFor the study, the middle-aged and elderly smokers were scanned with either a spiral CT or a chest X-ray once a year for three years starting in August 2002. They were followed for five years.\n\nThe researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit.\n\nAs of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study.\n\nEARLY DIAGNOSIS\n\nCaught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread. Only 15 percent of lung cancer patients live 5 years or more.\n\n“No one should come away from this announcement believing that it is safe to continue to smoke,” National Cancer Institute director Dr. Harold Varmus told a news conference.\n\n“This screening does not prevent lung cancer and it does not protect the large majority of subjects from death by lung cancer,” Varmus said.\n\nDr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is on the board of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he doubted most people would see the findings as a green light to smoke.\n\n“The majority of lung cancer diagnoses in the United States now are either in people who never smoked or in people who have quit,” Johnson said.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center caused a stir when she published a study saying that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.\n\nHer ideas were controversial to start with and widely disregarded when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.\n\nAlmost all advanced CT scanners can perform a spiral CT, and about 60 percent of U.S. hospitals have such a machine.

The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods — animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.\n\nBut in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.\n\nThe study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.\n\n(MORE: Study: ‘Good’ Fats Even Better for the Heart Than We Thought)\n\nSo Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.\n\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.\n\n(MORE: Study: Eating Omega-3s May Help Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk)\n\nThe latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. “I wouldn’t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,” he says. “What happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.”\n\nThere has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.\n\n(MORE: Can Olive Oil Help Prevent Stroke?)\n\nRecognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. “One of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,” says Lichtenstein. “Just looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead to unanticipated consequences. We need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components.”\n\nWhether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn’t clear yet, but Ramsden says the results of the latest study “could have important implications” for the way people eat if they want to stay heart-healthy.']",Better in some respects than the competing ,"This story failed to answer the questions that would have made the significance of these findings more readily apparent:

Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.\n\n""The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,"" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF\'s Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.\n\n""This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,"" he said.\n\nIn the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.\n\nMoreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.\n\n""We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,"" Hovorka said during Saturday\'s teleconference. ""What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.""\n\nThese results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. ""We reduced hypoglycemia by half,"" he said.\n\n""Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,"" Hovorka said.\n\nMeanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.\n\n""So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],"" she said during the teleconference.\n\nRitholz\'s team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.\n\nFrustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. ""We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,"" she said.\n\nPeople who were not successful used ""emotion-based coping,"" Ritholz said. ""They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.""\n\nIn addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or ""significant other,"" she added. All patients felt self-conscious wearing the device, Ritholz noted.\n\n""We know that CGM success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology,"" she said.\n\nSpeaking at the Saturday teleconference, Dr. William Tamborlane, chief of pediatric endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine and co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\'s Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group, said the system only works if worn almost every day.\n\nStudies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used CGM were able to reduce their blood sugar levels. However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.\n\nPeople who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.\n\nTo get more people to use CGM, ""the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,"" he said.\n\nArtificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.\n\nThe device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.\n\nHowever, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on type 1 diabetes, visit the American Diabetes Association.']","Like the USA Today story we reviewed, this one missed most of the disclaimers that should come with any coverage of such early research, while failing to provide context for the results.","Not only does this story neglect to provide any caveats regarding research abstracts presented at conferences, it omits the number of subjects in the study. One of the most important pieces of context for this study was that it only had 12 subjects. That needed to be in the article. In general, the term ""artifical pancreas"" builds unrealistic hope for this technology for patients, and some balance and caution would’ve enriched the optimism with realism, doing a greater service to those with diabetes who are very interested in this topic.

More than six million children in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as do more than 330 million children and adults worldwide, according to the Global Asthma Network.\n\nDr. Bisgaard said it was not possible to tell from the study whether pregnant women could benefit from simply eating more fish. Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their consumption of certain types of fish like swordfish and tuna because they contain mercury. But many other types are considered safe, especially smaller fish like sardines that are not at the top of the food chain and therefore not likely to accumulate mercury and other contaminants from eating other fish.\n\nThe results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists bought fish oil from a company that makes it, but they said the company had no role in the study. The research was paid for by the Danish government and private foundations.\n\nAn editorial in the same journal by an expert who was not part of the study praised the research, saying it was well designed and carefully performed. The author of that editorial, Dr. Christopher E. Ramsden, from the National Institutes of Health, said the findings would help doctors develop a “precision medicine” approach in which fish-oil treatment could be tailored to women who are most likely to benefit.']",This story did a lot of things well. The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest.,"This New York Times story looks at a new study showing a reduced risk of asthma in the children of mothers who took high doses of fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy.
The story was strong–it did a lot of things well. We were especially pleased to see the Times use both absolute and relative risk numbers when conveying the measured benefit. We learn, for example, that fish oil reduced the risk of asthma 31 percent, the relative risk benefit. That is tempered by inclusion of the absolute risk reduction–16.9% of mothers who supplemented had children with asthma, compared to 23.7 of mothers taking a placebo. This helps readers keep expectations in check.
The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest. One of the researchers has a financial interest in the genetic testing he advocates in the story — and readers should be aware of that interest as they consider his recommendations.

Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.\n\nProvenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine – meaning it works by training the patient’s immune system to attack the tumor – to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon’s manufacturing capacity has been limited.\n\nWhile Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.\n\n“Not only is C.M.S.’s action contrary to Congress’s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,’’ Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.\n\nWith expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.\n\nMedicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.\n\nSome analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug’s label – those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.\n\nThe Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.\n\nThe F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.\n\nBut the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.\n\nRobyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. “Historically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,’’ she wrote.\n\nDendreon’s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.\n\nThe assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.']","This story does a good job discussing the debate around whether federal funds should pay for this emerging prostate cancer treatment, but it failed in taking a critical look at the evidence, ultimately leaving readers with more certainty about the benefits of Provenge than the evidence warrants.","



This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story.

Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said functional issues resulting from conditions such as birth defects or prostate cancer surgery may warrant penile surgery, but such cases are unusual.\n\n""It\'s a very fragile organ to begin with,"" Kavaler said, ""and if you start to do all these things to it you can disfigure it... They should leave it alone.""\n\nStudy co-author Dr. Paolo Gontero said urologists are constantly approached by men concerned about their penis size, despite the fact that the majority are average, with a flaccid length of 1 to 4 inches.\n\n""However, most men complaining of inadequate penile size do have associated sexual problems even if their penile dimensions fall within the normal range -- so-called dysmorphophobic penis,"" said Gontero, an associate professor of urology at the University of Turin. ""No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category.""\n\nDysmorphophobia ""is a condition consisting of an imaginary flaw in the physical appearance,"" the study noted.\n\nWriting in the April issue of the British Journal of Urology International, Gontero and his colleagues found that penile extenders work better than techniques such as vacuum devices, exercises and Botox injections, and that psychological satisfaction is equally as important as any physical changes.\n\nA review of surgical techniques showed they increased phallus size an average of about a half-inch to 1 inch, but Gontero cautioned that the safest surgery -- which cuts the suspensory ligament of the penis to lengthen it -- often yields poor results.\n\n""On the contrary, more complex lengthening procedures are to be considered experimental and potentially dangerous,"" he said.\n\n""All procedures aimed to increase the penile girth should be considered unsafe, leading to potentially poor cosmetic and functional results,"" Gontero added. ""I have come across such cases that I had to re-operate in order to remove additive substances injected around the penis.""\n\nThe men studied ranged in age from 24 to 56 and were followed between three and 16 months.\n\nMore than 70 of them used penile extenders, with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising, pain and itching. These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction.\n\n""Application of progressive and constant traction forces is a very old-fashioned technique used by the ancestors and currently by some tribal populations to elongate the penis or the neck,"" he said.\n\nGontero noted that cognitive behavioral therapy might help build confidence in some men.\n\nLong-term vacuum treatments did not appear effective, producing no significant physical changes after six months, Gontero said, but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction.\n\nHe and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile-lengthening exercises.\n\nDr. E. Douglas Whitehead, director of New York Phalloplasty and associate clinical professor of urology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said suspensory ligament surgery to increase penis length can be more effective when combined with stretching techniques.\n\n""The human body, even bone, can be stretched,"" he said. ""So stretching the penis, when done long enough, will work. If anything, libido and desire are even better because you look better and feel better about yourself.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about penis size, visit Psychology Today.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Other than the headline and lead of this story, the story refrained from the usual cliches, puns or jokes often associated with stories about sexual health and instead provided good facts from this interesting, if limited, study on penile enhancement.</span>","The lack of cost information was a significant hole in the story, and there was no discussion of the limitations of the study or alternatives to treatment, especially given that the consensus in this story appears to be that most men with dissatisfaction about their penis size are suffering from a perception problem, not a physical problem. With some of these improvements, the story could have provided a much better service to readers.
There’s a lesson in this story for journalists to do a better job checking conflicts of interests in sources.  The story didn’t disclose that one of the authors has conducted research on a penile traction device and is quoted on the company’s advertising materials.

But Tirpak\'s physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.\n\nCord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.\n\n""That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,"" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient\'s relapse while awaiting the transplant.\n\nTraditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry\'s more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.\n\nNathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.\n\n""We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn\'t a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn\'t go that route,"" Mumford said.\n\nAt that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.\n\n""That was an opportunity,"" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin\'s disease as a child. ""That was a chance for me to live. I\'m not a quitter. I\'ve never been a quitter, so I wasn\'t going to quit.""\n\nMumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient\'s body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who\'s now 30, says he\'s never felt better.\n\n""I just feel amazing,"" he said. ""I have a lot of energy, and I\'m just excited about it.""\n\nMumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.\n\nTirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.\n\nNationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child\'s cord blood. If they do, it\'s collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.\n\nPublic blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child\'s blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.\n\nCord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.\n\n""Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,"" Tirpak said.\n\nOn Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife\'s funeral -- at a family wedding.']","This was an unbalanced story touting ""a medical breakthrough that’s saving lives.""  Two rosy anecdotes are the only evidence we get. The online headline also emphasizes a ""minority"" angle that is barely touched on in the story. ","A scan of the comments by readers shows how such journalism can inspire perhaps false hope. In addition, the lack of evidence evaluation and balance in this story prompted several readers, who claim to work with these patients, to describe a bleaker reality and caution against such false hope. One reader, BMTnurse, a self-described transplant nurse, note that patients he/she has seen ""tend to do rather poorly"" in comparison to sibling bone marrow transplant recipients, and that the procedure is a ""last-resort treatment"" and ""certainly not a miracle."" That nurse’s personal assessment of the survival rate among procedures he/she has seen is ""maybe 20 percent tops."" Does that even feel like the same procedure described in this story?
It’s a sad commentary when the commenters inject more balance and raise more important questions than the journalists.

They measured the scrotum-anus distance as well as the penis length of 117 infertile and 56 fertile men visiting an andrology clinic.\n\nThe infertile men had a significantly shorter anogenital distance and penis length than the fertile men, the study found.\n\nDr. Michael Eisenberg, a male reproductive medicine and surgery fellow in the Baylor urology department and the study\'s lead author, said the study has two main implications. ""First, this could represent a noninvasive way to test testicular function and reproductive potential in adult men,"" he said in a Baylor news release. ""And second, it suggests that gestational exposures and development may impact adult testicular function.""\n\nFurther research is needed to compare techniques for measuring anogenital distance and assess their accuracy, he and his colleagues said.\n\nOne expert who\'s done her own research in this area applauded the study.\n\n""This is an important paper showing, once again, that anogenital distance is a strong predictor of semen quality,"" said Shanna H.

At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.\n\nNext — and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these — high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths. And sugary drinks were a factor in 7.4 percent of the deaths.\n\nWe know, it may be tough to cut back on foods you love. Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the \'gateway\' to meat for vegetarians!\n\nBut, here\'s the flip side: The researchers also found there\'s a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.\n\nFor instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.\n\nIn addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Lawson/Belhaven/Getty Images John Lawson/Belhaven/Getty Images\n\n""The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,"" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.\n\nIn 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. ""This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day"" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.\n\nSo, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. ""Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,"" Mozaffarian says.\n\nThe new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.\n\nNow, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people\'s overall lifestyle.\n\nOne challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too — such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.\n\nThe Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it\'s not a perfect science.\n\n""Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,"" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. ""For instance, it\'s possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.""\n\nMozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. ""At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,"" he told us.\n\nHe says the bigger point is this: ""Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.""\n\nPoor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don\'t separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)\n\nIf you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don\'t have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it\'s excessive consumption that drives up the risk.\n\nFor instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. This means that a single 200-calorie sugary drink may be OK for a person who typically consumes a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet.\n\nThe problem: Most Americans consume much more.']","Despite cautioning readers about some of the limits of observational studies, this story makes many claims that observational data just can’t support.","This NPR story is about a study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which attempts to estimate the percentage of deaths from heart disease and diabetes associated with 10 specific dietary factors — things like too much sodium and processed meats, and not enough fruits and vegetables. The authors based their estimates on data from a large federal nutrition survey and other studies, most of which were observational in design.
Here’s the good news: The story puts a price tag on what diabetes costs the health care system, which is a great way to demonstrate why people should care about this kind of research. It also does a very nice job of cataloging the limitations of a study like this. It specifically acknowledges that observational research is subject to confounding bias, and that factors like socioeconomic status and physical activity might have skewed the results.
The bad news? These caveats comes deep into the story, long after a number of untenable claims have been made starting with the clickbait-ish headline: “Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death.” We wrote some tips on how to write better headlines for diet stories last week.    
A complete discussion of the limitations of this study would have informed readers that observational studies cannot prove cause and effect. Thus, the story’s claims that are derived from such studies, including that specific dietary factors “may cut risk” … or “can help raise or lower the risk of death” … or “contribute to about 6-8 percent of deaths,” are an inappropriate overstatement of the evidence. All we can say is that there is a statistical association between these factors and death — not that one caused the other.

(""Primary insomnia"" means that medical problems, medicines, or other substances have been ruled out as a cause of sleep difficulties. The more common type of insomnia is ""secondary insomnia,"" in which medical issues or medications contribute.)\n\nOf the patients with insomnia, the average age was 45 and nine were women. Participants slept for two nights in a sleep lab with no cap; two nights with the cap set at a ""neutral"" temperature (about 86 degrees Fahrenheit); two nights at a moderately cool temperature (72 degrees Fahrenheit); and two nights with the coolest temperature (57 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile the participants slept, researchers monitored their brain electrical activity, eye movements (to determine if someone was in REM, or rapid eye movement sleep) and jaw muscle tone (during REM, the muscles go slack due to \'sleep paralysis\').\n\nIn this preliminary study, about three-quarters of those with insomnia said the cap helped them sleep better when the water temperature was about 57 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAt higher temperatures -- 72 and 86 degrees -- patients reported no benefit, according to the study presented Monday at SLEEP 2011, the Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in Minneapolis.\n\nWhile wearing the cooling cap, it took insomnia patients an average of 13 minutes to fall asleep and they spent 89 percent of their time in bed actually sleeping, about the same as controls who didn\'t have insomnia (the latter group averaged 16 minutes to fall asleep and 89 percent of the time in bed sleeping) .\n\nThe cooling cap was, however, associated with an increased amount of slow-wave sleep -- or the deepest, restorative portion of sleep, the researchers reported.\n\n""What we wanted to find out was: \'Would cooling the surface of the brain of insomnia patients result in lower metabolism and improved sleep? The basic answer in this preliminary study, is yes, it seems to work, and it works in two ways,"" said Buysse. ""It does reduce brain metabolism in the frontal lobes, and it improves sleep.""\n\nDr. William Kohler, medical director of the Florida Sleep Institute, said the concept was exciting and worth further research in larger studies that include body temperature measurements and brain imaging tests.\n\n""The theoretical concept is correct, in that we do know from many previous studies that as the body core temperature cools, our sleep improves, and with warming of the core temperature, we have more restless sleep,"" Kohler said.\n\nChronic insomnia -- which the American Academy of Sleep Medicine attributes to about one out of every 10 Americans -- can be difficult to treat. Medications can help, although many people complain of side effects, Kohler said. The most effective treatment is cognitive behavior therapy, which involves changes such as avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and caffeine before bed, and getting plenty of bright light in the morning but turning off the TV, computer and dimming the lights during a wind-down period, among other techniques for improving ""sleep hygiene.""\n\n""It\'s in the brain where the chemical changes are occurring that lead to sleep,"" he said.\n\nThe cap is not yet available to consumers, although the lead researcher, Dr. Eric Nofzinger, has plans to bring it to market, Buysse said.\n\nBecause this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.\n\nBuysee said there shouldn\'t be any safety issues. If people get too cold, they would likely just wake up and take the cap off, he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on insomnia.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">It is striking how easily such preliminary pilot trial results garner news attention.</span>","This is an interesting story about interesting research for a common problem.  We appreciate the caveat at the end of the story – “Because this study was extremely small and presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal and confirmed in larger studies.”  That would be one of the first things we’d expect in a story about such a small, short-term study.

Healthy cartilage that covers the bone surfaces in the knee joint transfers these high loads from the lower leg to the upper leg. The cartilage covering the bone surface is not able to heal itself when it is damaged and this is why surgical procedures are available to repair the damaged area.\n\nThe case report highlights the journey a 39-year-old female endurance runner took from the end of her post-knee surgery rehabilitation to taking part in her sport again. An eight week return to running programme using the anti-gravity treadmill was individually designed by Dr Hambly.\n\nDevices like the anti-gravity treadmill, enable walking or running without the full weight of the body so reducing the load on the joints in the lower limbs and bridging the gap between rehabilitation and return to sport.\n\nThe air pressure in the treadmill can be adjusted to take the patient from 100 per cent of their body weight to only 20 per cent, the same feeling as walking on the moon, and reducing the impact and pressure on joints during the run.\n\nNot only does the tailored anti-gravity treadmill programme provide a great environment for healing, it also helps the person restore their belief that they can make a successful return to the sport they love.\n\nThe Sports Ready clinic is student-led under supervision of experienced practitioners, with patients self-referring or sent by private clinics and NHS orthopaedic consultants. The team individually tailors rehabilitation programmes to support people in returning to sport and exercise activities after injury or surgery.\n\nA free one day symposium presents Translating Research into Practice on Monday 10 July at the Church Lecture Theatre, Royal Historic Dockyard, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TE from 9.30am-4.30pm.\n\n###\n\nFor further information or interview requests contact Sandy Fleming at the University of Kent Press Office.\n\nTel: 01227 823581/01634 888879\n\nEmail: S.Fleming@kent.ac.uk']","This news release is based entirely on a single case study. Cost, harms, availability and numbers that put the claims in context are all missing, too.","Researchers in the UK presented a single case study of a 39-year-old runner who had surgery on her knee followed by physical therapy using a special treadmill. The release claimed the “anti-gravity” treadmill, which reduces the pressure of weight on the knee, helped this patient reduce fears about re-injury and increase their confidence in their ability to run again. The release did not provide any data to support that claim.
The release would have been stronger had it included a mention of the cost and availability of anti-gravity treadmills. They’re very expensive pieces of equipment but are becoming more widely available through rehabilitation clinics.

This compares with just 33% identified by Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) alone.\n\n""This is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer. The preliminary data from this study showed that Volition\'s panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal high-grade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than PSA alone. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. The next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials"" said Dr. Jake Micallef, Chief Scientific Officer at Volition.\n\nProstate cancer (PCA) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the U.S. after lung cancer2. Currently, PCA is diagnosed through medical history, physical examination and by elevated levels of PSA in the blood. Men suspected of PCA are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer. However, most men with elevated PSA levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have low-grade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment.\n\nIn the Proof of Concept Study, a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three Belgian hospitals. The men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer (most of whom had elevated PSA levels), low-grade cancer or high-grade cancer. The samples were tested with a panel of five assays (PSA, two Nu.Q™ assays and two inflammatory biomarkers).\n\nThe assay results correlated with the Gleason Score, which is one of the main predictors for aggressive PCA determined on biopsy. This suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using PSA tests for men with actual or suspected PCA, leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies.\n\nCommenting on the results, Principal Investigator, Professor Thierry Roumeguere, Head of Urological Services, Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium said ""A non-invasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease. The correlation of the panel blood test results with Gleason Score shows great promise in this regard. We will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pre-treatment risk stratification.""\n\nCameron Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer at Volition commented ""This small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology. If these results are validated in larger trials, they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity. Volition\'s research team is continuing to develop our Nu.Q™ assays and we aim to launch products in 2019.""\n\nDr. Gaetan Michel, Chief Executive Officer of Volition\'s wholly-owned subsidiary, Belgian Volition SPRL, commented, ""We would like to thank the Walloon Region for their continued support of the company. The funding provided by the region has enabled this study and will support our continued research.""\n\n1The Gleason Score is a method used to grade prostate cancers based on how normal or abnormal the prostate biopsy cancer tissue appears under the microscope. 2https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html\n\nAbout Volition\n\nVolition is a multi-national life sciences company focused on developing simple, easy to use, cost effective blood tests designed to help diagnose a range of cancers.

The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.\n\nAccording to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients\' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington\'s is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.\n\nThe results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe study included 437 Huntington\'s disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.\n\nAfter six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.\n\n""Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits.

The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\nThe question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: “Why not induce everyone at 39 weeks?” Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\n[Here’s what’s being done to lower the maternal death rate]\n\n“My original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,” Lockwood said, “was that Dr. Norwitz would take the ‘pro’ side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the ‘con’ side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.”\n\nCharles J. Lockwood found studies suggesting that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce complications in mothers and infants. (University of South Florida)\n\nNorwitz was a vigorous proponent. “There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.\n\n“But Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,” Lockwood said. “Beyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.”\n\nAfter Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.\n\nBefore either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nNorwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.\n\n“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.\n\nAnd, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. “Stillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,” he said. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”\n\n“There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” said Errol Norwitz, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine. (Tufts Medical Center)\n\nLockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.\n\nLabor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.\n\nCristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors’ remarks suggest that all babies need to be “rescued by birth,” creating an anti-woman mentality. “It’s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,” said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.\n\nPascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation “reinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor’s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator — like in the ’50s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.”\n\nConsumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. “It’s disheartening to see how hard that’s going to be for some physicians to do.”\n\nLockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. “I think a lot of this gets very emotional,” Norwitz said.\n\nAlthough both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn’t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that “it’s a very healthy discussion to have.”\n\nDue dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman’s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.\n\nAs he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.\n\nStill, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.\n\n[I didn’t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]\n\nTraditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn’t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with “unfavorable, long and hard cervixes” — as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction — the risk of Caesarean is increased.\n\nRebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it “concerning and rash” for doctors at the meeting to make “broad conclusions” that “could potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.”\n\nNorwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. “This is my interpretation of the published literature,” he said. “This is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.”\n\nLockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.\n\nDekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. “They still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,” she said.\n\nDekker isn’t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.\n\n“It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”\n\nAnd, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.\n\nFor Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.\n\nThere are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital’s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. “We midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,” she told him. “Obstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.”\n\nEsther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. “Since we don’t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?”\n\nHausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)\n\nDekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.\n\nBeverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.\n\n“What changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,” Siegal said. “I would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.”\n\nOf course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.\n\n“Finally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,” he said.\n\n“But obviously our messages — how you talk — does make a difference,” Norwitz said.']","“Should pregnant women be induced at 39 weeks?” After reading this story, it is unlikely readers will be any closer to answering the headline question.","This is a story about whether pregnant women should have labor induced once they reach 39 weeks.
But, the issue is discussed in a confusing way, with the bulk of the story dedicated to statements from a debate on the issue at a recent medical conference. There’s also a strong “he said, she said” undertone: Except for one brief quote, the proponents of inducing at 39 weeks are men and the advocates of waiting longer are women.
Unfortunately, readers are not given any solid grounds to evaluate the competing positions, just vague conflicting claims that ping-pong through the story. The question posed by this story has been studied and considered for many years, and so readers deserve more than a story that just tosses equal portions of opposing arguments at them without providing hard numbers about possible benefits and harms–or any clear sense about the quality of the evidence deployed by each side in the debate.

This approach helps decide ,"['ANN ARBOR, Michigan -- Even as treatment options for laryngeal cancer seemed to improve, survival rates did not. For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.\n\nBut the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.\n\nAfter a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting ""exceptional"" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.\n\n""In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,"" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.\n\n""This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that\'s only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,"" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.\n\nThe Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.\n\nIn a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn\'t just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.\n\n""We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,"" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.\n\nOver 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.\n\nAverage disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.\n\n""This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we\'ll get the best results,"" Wolf says.\n\nThe study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.\n\nWolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.\n\nThe induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.\n\nEven that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients. Wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy.\n\n###\n\nAdditional authors: Emily Bellile, M.S.; Avraham Eisbruch, M.D.; Susan Urba, M.D.; Carol R.

Correlation doesn’t equal causation.","The release focuses on recent research published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery. The research assessed the effectiveness of a treatment technique for laryngeal cancer that exposed patients with advanced (stage 3 or 4) cancer to a one-time chemotherapy treatment that, theoretically, would allow physicians to determine whether patients were responding well to chemotherapy. The idea was that patients who responded well could be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, whereas patients who did not respond well would have surgery to remove the voice box immediately, rather than trying chemotherapy and radiation first. The goal was to improve the five-year survival rate of patients. The researchers reported that this technique — called “induction chemotherapy” — was effective, leading to 79 percent survival rates for patients with advanced laryngeal cancer — which is markedly better than the 66 percent survival rate for those patients who did not receive induction chemotherapy.
The release does a nice job describing the historical context of these therapies, how available the techniques are and how the study was conducted, with one exception.

Too Good to Be True?,"['Corbis\n\nA glass of wine or two a week — and not more than one large glass on any occasion — may be safe during pregnancy, according to a large study just published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked))\n\nBut this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys — after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%.\n\nThe study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children.\n\nThe research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn’t drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I’m Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose)\n\nInterestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.)\n\nYet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women’s self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at “light” levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy — and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they’re pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.\n\nMore on Time.com:\n\nEven More Evidence for the Health Benefits of Drinking\n\nPhotos: What Booze Looks like Under a Microscope\n\nRecipes: Meat-Based Cocktails']",A thoughtful story on a highly-charged topic that provides informative context.

The study itself is a little more complicated, and this story does a nice job of exploring the study’s limitations and the broader scope of the science around alcohol consumption and fetal development.

The 75-year-old retired teacher in Santa Fe, N.M., says she’s had at least eight basal and squamous cell cancers scraped, frozen and surgically excised from her arms, face and shoulders.\n\nWhen a basal-cell cancer reappeared on Mrs. Weiser’s nose last year, her dermatologist suggested a new, painless, nonsurgical treatment and she eagerly agreed. After 16 treatments with a small radiation device held millimeters from her nose, the tumor was gone. “I felt nothing—just some mild itching,” she says. “I much prefer radiation to having something dug out of my nose with a scalpel.”\n\nThe new procedure, called surface electronic brachytherapy, or eBx, is beginning to cause a stir in the world of non-melanoma skin cancers, the most common type of cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology’s official position is that surgery is the most effective treatment, and that more long-term data is needed before the safety and effectiveness of eBx can be determined.\n\nLast month, an editorial in the journal JAMA Dermatology raised other concerns. Noting that use of the procedure has risen 20-fold in recent years, to 24,000 procedures in 2013, the authors said that makers of the eBx equipment are marketing it to “busy people” who “aren’t interested in surgery” and pitching it to dermatology practices as a moneymaking service. Medicare reimbursements can run as high as $24,000 per patient, compared with $200 to $2100 for typical skin-cancer treatments, the authors said.\n\nOfficials for the two companies that make eBx equipment—Xoft Inc. and Elekta Inc. —say they agree that surgery is still the standard of care for non-melanoma skin cancers, but that eBx offers an attractive option for patients who can’t, or don’t want to, have surgery.\n\nToni Weiser, of Santa Fe, N.M., opted for radiation to treat skin cancer on her nose. Photo: Weiser Family\n\nMore than 3.6 million Americans are diagnosed with basal or squamous cell cancers every year—more than all other cancers combined. Unlike melanomas, they are rarely fatal. But they can invade surrounding tissues and become disfiguring. Dermatologists almost always recommend removing them.\n\nStandard treatments depend on the size, type, location and depth of the tumor and the patients age. They range from topical creams to burning, freezing, and Mohs surgery, where layers of tumor-containing skin are progressively removed until no cancer remains.\n\nRadiation has also been used for decades, typically for skin cancers that are hard to reach, for patients who can’t tolerate surgery, or in addition to surgery for high-risk lesions. Those treatments usually take place in a hospital or radiation oncology center, with lead-lined rooms and linear accelerators.\n\nThe new eBx treatment uses a miniaturized X-ray source in a small mobile unit that can be wheeled from room to room in a doctor’s office. Radiation is delivered directly to the cancer site by a mechanical arm with minimal shielding so the therapist can stay by the patient’s side.\n\nRick Cox, of Cave Creek, Ariz., paid $8,000 for radiation instead of having surgery. Photo: Judy Cox\n\nXoft, whose Axxent eBx device is the market leader, estimates that about one-third of patients with non-melanoma skin cancers—more than 1 million a year—are potential candidates for the new treatment, including those whose cancers are in prominent places like the eyes, ears and nose. Tumors must be less than four centimeters wide and no more than five millimeters deep for eBx treatment, Xoft says.\n\n“We have a great, nonsurgical, painless alternative to what can be a very time-consuming and painful procedure, and we are getting very effective clinical outcomes,” says Ken Ferry, CEO of Xoft’s parent company iCAD Inc. He says Xoft has sold about 100 units, mostly to dermatology practices, since 2011, although the company and some states require that a radiation oncologist administer the treatment.\n\nElekta Inc., a large Swedish maker of radiation equipment, has a competing device called the Esteya. It has installed fewer than 25 to date in the U.S., says Jay Hoey, president and CEO of Elekta Holdings, North America.\n\nBoth companies say research from older treatments shows that radiation is safe and effective for non-melanoma skin cancers. Mr. Ferry says that in six studies to date, some 1,300 patients, with 1,900 lesions, have been treated with eBx, and some have been followed for as long as four years. The most common side effects are temporary redness, dryness, itching, soreness and blistering. Only nine recurrences of the skin cancer have been reported.\n\nSome dermatologists say the experience with older radiation treatments isn’t comparable, adding that the median follow-ups in the eBx studies are just a few months. Skin cancer recurrences and severe side effects can take four or more years to appear.\n\nOne concern is that skin subjected to radiation can turn white and develop fibrous tissue that tightens, thickens and blocks blood supply.\n\nRadiation itself can cause secondary cancers decades later. “I have 70- and 80-year-old patients with extensive skin cancers where they had radiation for acne when they were kids,” says Jack Resneck, a professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, who co-wrote the JAMA Dermatology editorial. “The younger you are when you are treated, the longer you have to develop those secondary cancers.”\n\nAjay Bhatnagar, a radiation oncologist in Casa Grande, Ariz., who has led several eBx studies and receives research funds from Xoft, says he turns away patients under age 50 due to the risk of secondary cancers, although he notes the risk is low, at only about 0.1% a year.\n\nMohs has disadvantages, too, including scars and the need for reconstructive surgery in some cases, says Christopher Zachary, a professor of dermatology at University of California, Irvine, whose practice offers both Mohs and eBx.\n\n“There are patients in their 70s and 80s who say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to have any more cutting. I’ve had enough,’ which is not unreasonable,” he says. He is planning to lead a multi-center randomized trial treating 500 patients with either Mohs or eBx with a five-year follow-up.\n\nThe cost issue is more complicated. The eBx treatment has a temporary billing code originally used for breast and brain radiation, for which Medicare pays $770 to $1,600 per treatment. With 8 treatments per skin cancer, plus facility and other fees, practices can earn as much as $24,000 per patient, according to a Xoft analysis provided to inquiring dermatologists.\n\nBy contrast, older forms of radiation for skin cancer are reimbursed as little as $27 a treatment. Medicare reimbursement for Mohs surgery and repair is typically less than $2,000, dermatologists say.\n\nAs of now, Medicare covers eBx in 21 Western and Midwestern states. It covers the treatment on a case-by-case basis in Texas and the South and doesn't cover it in Florida or New England, where it is more difficult to find. Private insurance coverage also varies.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatologists is concerned that such high reimbursement rates for eBx could draw scrutiny from government regulators.\n\nASTRO, the professional organization for radiation oncologists, is also wary. “We think radiation has a valuable role in the treatment of selected skin cancers,” says the group’s president-elect David Beyer. “But you as a consumer should get the treatment that’s best for you, not best for your doctor.”\n\nMrs. Weiser, who paid only $90 for the treatment after Medicare and supplemental insurance, is convinced that eBx was best for her. “If I can possibly avoid Mohs surgery again, I will,” she says.\n\nAnother veteran of many skin cancers, Rick Cox, age 62, of Cave Creek, Ariz., paid $8,000 out of pocket for eBx rather than have surgery, and a possible skin graft, on his nose. He is so happy with the results he now hands out brochures about it to all of his friends.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nApproximately 10,000 patients have had skin cancers treated with Xoft’s eBx to date, including 1,300 followed in six studies, and the risk of secondary cancers is approximately 0.1% per year. An earlier version of this story erroneously said that the 1,300 patients followed had been treated to date, and that the risk of secondary cancers is 1% per year. (April 6, 2015)""]","This is a case where the body text of the story sends one message, but the headline and photos send a different one.","This was a strong overall story about an increasingly popular radiation treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers. Importantly, it cautions readers about the absence of long-term safety data, as well as the high costs of the treatment relative to more standard procedures such as freezing the tumor or surgically removing it. But the story’s heavy reliance on anecdotal testimonials, as well as a headline (“Many patients prefer the new x-ray treatment to surgical procedures”) and smiling patient photos that project undocumented patient enthusiasm for the treatment, may overwhelm these cautions. We encourage you to view the original story to get a sense of what we’re talking about.
Please also note that we gave the benefit of the doubt in a couple of instances which, if we’d swung the other way on our rating, would have brought this down to a 4-star score.

Following this procedure, patients are often prescribed long-term, daily oral anticoagulation medications -- also known as blood thinners. However, a new study shows the use of novel anticoagulants for AF prescribed on an ""as-needed basis"" guided by diligent pulse monitoring, can be a safe and effective alternative to lowering overall risk of stroke. Researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania presented their findings today at the Heart Rhythm Society\'s 37th Annual Scientific Session in San Francisco.\n\nOral anticoagulation therapy is recommended in patients with infrequent AF and high risk of stroke, however, prolonged use of blood thinners is associated with a higher bleeding risk. To determine an alternate but effective therapy, the researchers enrolled 100 patients age 45-78 with significant stroke risk and coupled with diligent pulse monitoring -- manually or by using a smartphone - twice a day with ""as needed"" anticoagulants for the treatment of AF. Patients were provided with novel oral anticoagulants and were instructed to start taking the medication if they suspected or detected an AF episode lasting longer than one hour.\n\n""This kind of approach to anticoagulation therapy requires an open line of communication between the patient and the care team, and calls for a specific type of patient. We call them ""highly motivated patients,"" said lead author Monica Pammer, PA-C, a physician assistant in Electrophysiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. ""These are patients who were actively seeking, preparing for and are committed to the alternate treatment method, and who are informed about how to diligently and effectively monitor their pulse throughout the day.""\n\nResearchers followed the participates for approximately 23 months, during which time 28 patients started taking the blood thinner at least once for a suspected or detected AF episode, and only 10 patients transitioned back to chronic oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent AF. No patients experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack - also called a mini-stroke -- and there was only one mild bleeding incident that required medical attention.\n\n""It is extremely common for patients with AF to seek treatment that does not involve the use of chronic oral anticoagulants therapy, as there are other risks associated with their long term use,"" said co-author Francis E. Marchlinski, MD, FHRS, director of Electrophysiology for the University of Pennsylvania Health System and Richard T. and Angela Clark President\'s Distinguished Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The goal of this study was to find a safe and effected treatment option, and our initial results support \'as-needed\' blood thinners and pulse monitoring as the alternative.""\n\nAll patients enrolled had no AF recurrences during an extended period of telemetry monitoring before the study began, and were willing and able to check their pulses manually or by a smartphone-enabled device twice a day. Of these patients, 84 had been ablated, sixteen were being treated with drug therapy, and three had implanted devices that served as a quality control check.\n\n""While this is an observational study with a relatively small patient sample, further research is certainly needed to better understand alternate treatment options,"" said Pammer. ""And, we stress that \'as-needed\' blood thinners should not be considered unless the patient qualifies as highly motivated.""\n\n###\n\nPenn Medicine is one of the world\'s leading academic medical centers, dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and excellence in patient care.

But they also appear to extend life -- although researchers don’t yet know how they do this.\n\nIn a study of 362 people released Wednesday, Australian scientists found that people taking bisphosphonates -- which include the medications Fosamax, Boniva and Actonel -- gain an extra five years of life compared with people with osteoporosis who were taking other forms of therapy for the illness -- such as calcium, vitamin D or hormone therapy -- and those taking no therapy.\n\nThe death rate for women taking bisphosphonates was 0.8% per 100 person-years, compared with 1.2% for women taking hormone therapy, 3.2% for women taking calcium and vitamin D and 3.5% for women taking no treatment. In men, bisphosphonates also lowered the death rate compared with other therapies.\n\n“In a group of women with osteoporotic fractures over the age of 75, you would expect 50% to die over a period of five years,” a coauthor of the study, Jacqueline Center of Sydney’s Gravan Institute of Medical Research, said in a news release. “Among women in that age group who took bisphosphonates, the death rate dropped to 10%.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt’s not clear what accounts for this benefit. It could be that people taking bisphosphonates are generally healthier or get better overall healthcare. But the researchers suggest that the link is tied to physiology.

Preventing bone loss may prevent the release of these toxic substances and the damage they do.\n\nBisphosphonates do produce side effects such as heartburn, however.

(March 23, 2017)—Statin drugs are widely used to manage high cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But in a new review of more than 50 studies, researchers cite reductions in liver inflammation and improvements in other related factors as reasons why statins make good candidates for treating chronic liver disease. The article is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.\n\nReducing cholesterol can have a positive effect on many chronic liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in biliary disorders. In some studies, the research team found that statins reduced inflammatory molecules that are typically elevated with liver disease and improved inflammation in the endothelium (cells that line the blood vessels). Statin use may also lead to:• Decreased fibrosis (hardening or scarring of tissue),• Less development of fatty liver,• Slowed or halted spread of hepatitis C virus,• Improvement of portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the liver’s blood vessels), • Destruction of existing liver tumor cells, and • Reduced risk of developing liver cancer.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that statin drugs can contribute to liver damage in some people, but for people with advanced liver disease, “[s]tatins are cost-effective, generally well-tolerated by patients and the benefits of statin treatment in most patients outweigh their potential hepatotoxic risk.”\n\nRead the full article, “Rationale for the use of statins in liver disease” published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.

Starting low-dose treatment early in menopause made women feel better and did not seem to raise heart risks during the four-year study.\n\nHowever, the research didn\'t address the risk of breast cancer, perhaps the biggest fear women have about hormones since a landmark study a decade ago. The new one was too small and too short for that.\n\nStill, it is the first fresh research in many years on the sometimes confusing effects of hormones on women\'s health. The advice remains the same: Use hormones only for severe symptoms – not to prevent bone loss or aging-related problems – at the lowest dose for the shortest time possible.\n\n""The benefits outweigh the risks when hormone therapy is used for symptom management with relatively short-term treatment,"" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, preventive medicine chief at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston. She was a study leader and will discuss results Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla.\n\nFor decades, doctors believed hormone pills helped prevent heart problems and were good for bones and minds. That changed in 2002, when a big federal study was stopped because women taking estrogen-progestin pills had higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nCritics pounced on the study\'s limitations. Participants were well past menopause – 63 on average – and most were not seeking symptom relief. Many were overweight and smokers, and at higher risk of heart disease to start with. Only one type of pill in one dose was tested.\n\nWomen who could take estrogen alone – those who had had hysterectomies – did not have the risks that women on the combination hormone pills did. In fact, they had lower rates of breast cancer.\n\nThese factors led many experts to think some hormones might help certain women, and that the type and dose might matter. The new study tested that.\n\nIt enrolled about 700 healthy women ages 42 to 58 within three years of menopause. They were given either low-dose estrogen pills (Premarin, made by Wyeth, now part of Pfizer Inc.), a low-dose estrogen skin patch (Climara, made by Bayer), or a placebo. Women on estrogen also received Prometrium, a progesterone that more closely mimics what the body makes.\n\nAll women received a patch and two types of pills, but some of those were fake treatments and neither they nor their doctors knew who had the real medicine versus placebos until the study ended. That is standard study design to test who is really helped by a medication.\n\nThe main goal was seeing whether hormones made a difference in hardening of the arteries, a precursor to heart disease, as seen on imaging tests. Other health measures also were tracked. After four years, doctors found:\n\n_No effect on blood pressure or artery hardening.\n\n_Both types of estrogen reduced hot flashes and improved bone density, mood and sexual health.\n\n_Estrogen pills raised good cholesterol and lowered the bad form, but also caused triglycerides (another type of fat in the bloodstream) to rise.\n\n_Estrogen patches did not affect cholesterol but improved blood-sugar levels and insulin sensitivity, possibly making them a better choice for overweight women at risk of diabetes.\n\nPatches and pills have different effects, said Dr. S. Mitchell Harman, an endocrinologist and director of the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a Phoenix-based group with no industry ties that paid for the study. Oral estrogen goes straight to the liver, resulting in higher concentrations than when it\'s absorbed through the skin. That raises blood-clotting factors that might be especially harmful to smokers. But higher estrogen levels also cause the liver to make more HDL, or good cholesterol. So estrogen can have good and bad effects depending on the form, he said.\n\nSkin patches account for just 2 percent of hormone use, some studies estimate. Besides Climara, at least one other is on the market – Vivelle-Dot, sold by Novartis and Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. A generic version is expected in about a year.\n\nDr. Sanjay Asthana, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led a separate analysis that found estrogen pills and patches improved depression and anxiety but had no effect on cognition or memory. The National Institute on Aging paid for that study.\n\nWomen need to realize the new study is much less definitive than the big federal one that found more lung and breast cancer deaths among women on estrogen-progestin pills, said one researcher involved in the earlier work, Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. It would be unwise to try to prevent certain health problems by using a treatment ""that increased the two leading causes of cancer deaths in women,"" he said.\n\nManson agreed that hormones should be used only for severe symptoms. Two study participants found they helped.\n\n""My mood leveled out. I found that I was just generally calmer"" on the estrogen patch, said Kathy Smerko, 60, a nurse practitioner from Phoenix.\n\nDianne Fraser, 56, an accountant from suburban Boston, said the patch eliminated the drenching sweats that woke her in the night. She was able to quit treatment after five years and seldom has problems now.\n\n""It was enough to get me through that crazy period"" right after menopause began, she said.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\n___']",The AP story did a much better job than ,"A new trial called the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) contradicts findings from the well-known Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). Despite the new study’s limitations of being “too small and too short,” it still is fresh research that may shed some more light on the effects of hormone replacement therapy on menopausal women. But as the AP story effectively points out, “Women need to realize the new study is much less definitive than the big federal one.”
The take-away from this study should be that FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE BOTHERSOME MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, there is some reassurance that HT is does not seem to promote cardiovascular disease. There’s also a little disappointment that, contrary to the researcher’s hypothesis (which has some decent evidence behind it) estrogen did not seem to protect the arteries from atherosclerotic changes that accompany aging. By the end of the article, these points are made pretty clear.

But up to 20 percent of patients with a high risk of relapse are not cured. That could change with the results from a clinical trial co-led by investigators from NYU Langone Medical Center, which shows giving high doses of a commonly-used chemotherapy drug increases the survival rate for these patients.\n\nThe high-dose methotrexate protocol outlined in the study - along with a parallel finding that the steroid decadron is beneficial for younger (but not older) patients - has quickly become the standard practice for the treatment of high-risk ALL patients in North America, the researchers report in the April XX issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nFor more than 50 years, ALL patients have been treated with a combination of steroids and methotrexate, among other agents. Patients classified as high risk for relapse--those with a high white blood cell count or who are more than 10 years old--are treated with a standard phase of therapy where methotrexate is given in a gradual, escalating dosage. The current study showed that an alternative schedule of high-dose methotrexate was superior. Prior to the release of the initial study results, which were first presented last year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the standard of care for high-risk ALL patients in North America was escalating methotrexate.\n\n""One of the improvements in outcome for ALL overall has been using methotrexate in a more intense fashion, by giving higher doses,"" said senior investigator William L. Carroll, MD, the Julie and Edward J. Minskoff Professor of Pediatrics, director of the Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children\'s Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at NYU Langone and director emeritus of NYU Langone\'s Perlmutter Cancer Center. ""We designed this study to compare high dose and escalating methotrexate to determine the best way to use this drug to increase the survival of high-risk ALL patients.""\n\nThis was a large-scale study involving pediatric cancer centers across the country. More than 3,000 patients with high-risk ALL were enrolled in the randomized clinical trial, which was run by the Children\'s Oncology Group, a multi-institutional clinical trials consortium supported by the National Cancer Institute. The investigators found that patients in either arm responded very well overall to treatments, but those in the high dose group had a significantly better outcome, by 5 to 6 percent, which translated into a significantly decreased relapse rate for these patients.\n\nThe clinical protocol also examined how to best use a steroid formulation called decadron to treat high-risk ALL patients. Steroids as a class of drugs are one of the most effective medications in the treatment of ALL. Previous studies by the Children\'s Oncology Group showed that in standard risk ALL patients--those with low white blood cell counts or under 10 years of age--decadron prevented relapse in both the spinal fluid and in the bone marrow. Decadron, however, can increase the infection rate, particularly in high-risk ALL patients, when given for the full 28-day induction period.\n\nDuring this clinical trial, the investigators decreased the duration of decadron from 28 days to 14 to determine if patients could avoid the side effect of increased infection while still benefiting from the steroid\'s anti-leukemic effects. They found that patients 10 years and older saw no benefit from decadron, and, in fact, were at much higher risk for a debilitating bone condition called osteonecrosis. Patients under 10 years of age, however, did benefit from the shorter decadron exposure with no increased side effects.\n\n""The improvement in cure rates for ALL over the last few decades, for the most part, has not come through the introduction of new medications, but through using existing medications in new ways, in terms of their dose and schedule,"" Dr. Carroll said. ""This clinical trial illustrates that despite what seem to be remarkable outcomes for kids with ALL, we have not reached a plateau. The outcomes are getting better and better.""\n\n###\n\nDr. Carroll\'s co-authors are Eric C.

The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data.\n\nSelvin\'s group analyzed that data, and reported that a positive result for glucose and HbA1c from just a single blood sample can confirm type 2 diabetes.\n\nThis could change care, ""potentially allowing a major simplification of current clinical practice guidelines,"" Selvin said in a university news release. ""Doctors are already doing these [glucose and HbA1c] tests together -- if a patient is obese, for example, and has other risk factors for diabetes, the physician is likely to order tests for both glucose and HbA1c from a single blood sample.\n\n""It\'s just that the guidelines don\'t clearly let you use the tests from that one blood sample to make the initial diabetes diagnosis,"" she explained.\n\nDiabetes is treatable, but about 3 million Americans with the disease don\'t know they have it.\n\n""I\'m hoping that these results will lead to a change in the clinical guidelines when they are revised in early 2019, which could make identifying diabetes a lot more efficient in many cases,"" Selvin said.\n\nDiabetes experts welcomed the findings.\n\n""Diabetes moves fast, and the cost of diabetes has increased more than 20 percent since 2012,"" noted Dr. Robert Courgi. The new study ""helps us move quicker to treat diabetes,"" he said.\n\n""By diagnosing diabetes quicker, we can improve outcomes,"" said Courgi, an endocrinologist at Northwell Health\'s Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. ""The current standard is to delay diagnosis with repeat office visits and blood work. Now we can educate the patient sooner and start treatment earlier to prevent complications of diabetes such as heart attack, dialysis and amputations.""\n\nDr. Gerald Bernstein coordinates the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He agreed that quicker diagnosis could mean better treatment and outcomes for patients.\n\n""The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes,"" Bernstein noted. ""Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin.""\n\nAccording to Bernstein, if only one diagnostic test were needed, ""this would mean that a follow-up visit would be a look at the treatment benefits -- rather than a confirmation of an abnormal glucose.""\n\nThe study was published June 19 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Diabetes Association has more on type 2 diabetes.']","For help understanding medical tests such as these, see our primer: ","This story reported on a study that examined data from a long-running U.S. heart disease study to conclude that testing both a patient’s fasting glucose and A1C from a single blood sample is sufficient to confirm type 2 diabetes. Current guidelines call for performing either test once, followed by a second confirmatory test, thus requiring two separate lab visits and blood draws. The study was reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
The story’s strong point was that it tapped two independent sources. On the downside, it didn’t report that the single-sample testing method could miss many cases of diabetes or explore whether it would lead to better outcomes for patients, like avoiding complications of diabetes.

Pfizer last week announced a deal with Canadian biotech Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp for this type of delivery vehicle for its RNAi drugs, joining Roche and Alnylam.\n\nIn the approach used by Davis and colleagues, once the particles find the cancer cell and get inside, they break down, releasing small interfering RNAs or siRNAs that block a gene that makes a cancer growth protein called ribonucleotide reductase.\n\n“In the particle itself, we’ve built what we call a chemical sensor,” Davis said in a telephone interview. “When it recognizes that it’s gone inside the cell, it says OK, now it’s time to disassemble and give off the RNA.”\n\nIn a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with various types of tumors, the team gave doses of the targeted nanoparticles four times over 21 days in a 30-minute intravenous infusion.\n\nTumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells.\n\nAnd they found evidence that the therapy had disabled ribonucleotide reductase, suggesting the RNA had done its job.\n\nDavis could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors in the patients, but one patient did get a second cycle of treatment, suggesting it might be. Nor could he say if there were any safety concerns.\n\nDavis said that part of the study will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June.']","Tumor samples taken from three people with melanoma were tested.  Is that sufficient to call this ""early proof""…that the approach ""had done its job""?","The story highlights the very early and incomplete results of a Phase 1 study of the use of nanoparticles to deliver small interfering RNA to tumor cells in three subjects with melanoma.  This approach to the treatment of cancer  is new and these early results suggest the model may be of value.  However, the story does not note that the report in the journal Nature was in fact a letter to the editor and not a full study report.  The results are preliminary and have not been presented or subjected to peer review.  As such, some level of conservatism would seem appropriate in reporting.  However, the story uses phrases that provide the reader with an inflated impression of the results to date.

The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by 20%.\n\nIn 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test. And in April 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors. Some men between 55 and 69 years of age might well decide to get their PSA checked, the task force said. After hearing the ledger of pros and cons, however, others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test, the panel concluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, now calls those recommendations into question. The authors of the study, led by biostatistician Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, concluded that screening men over age 55 “can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death.”\n\nWhen men who fit the criteria for screening get the PSA test, the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between 25% and 32%, the new study found.\n\nBut the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen, where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial, and how you crunch the numbers.\n\nIn the end, said Vanderbilt University urological surgeon Dr. Sam Chang, the new analysis “reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along: that PSA screening is helpful.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is helpful, said Chang, only when it focuses on the right men — those between 55 and 70 — and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively.\n\nSometimes, said Chang, who was not involved in the newly published article, a man will get a problematic PSA test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively. But knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing, he added.\n\n“Over the past five to 10 years, there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over-treatment,” Chang said. “You want to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment.”\n\nChang underscored that for two groups in particular — African American men and those with a first-degree relative who died of prostate cancer — knowing is especially important, because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others. Neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis.\n\nIn an editorial published alongside the new analysis, Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also made clear that it’s what patients and their physicians do after the PSA test that matters most.\n\n“Unfortunately, the way screening has been implemented in the United States leaves much to be desired,” Vickers wrote. “The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm,” he added.\n\nProstate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men, affecting 101.6 of 100,000 American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 176,000 got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and 28,000 died of it.\n\nBut a change in a man’s reading on the PSA test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble: approximately 80% of positive PSA test results are thought to produce false-positives, creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies. And treatment, which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function, urination and bowel movements, is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow-growing they will never make a man sick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it, more and more men are skipping the PSA test. And among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding, fewer and fewer are opting to treat it.\n\nEarlier this year, a long-running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose “active surveillance” (sometimes called watchful waiting) were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy']","The headline and lead paragraphs include statements about screening saving lives, without telling readers about key limitations and uncertainties in the new analysis.","This story about a new analysis of data on PSA screening includes many important details about the meaning of the study results. It points out harms of prostate cancer treatment and concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
However, the cautionary statements are pushed down to the bottom half of the story. The headline and lead paragraphs include statements about screening saving lives, without telling readers about absolute risks or about limitations and uncertainties in the new analysis. By reporting a relative risk reduction of up to 32 percent–without also reporting that since fewer than 3 out of 100 men die of prostate cancer the absolute risk reduction is likely less than 1 percent–the story leaves readers with an inflated sense of how many lives might be saved by increased screening.

Daily intake of dried ginger significantly reduced sneezing and other signs of allergy in rodents with induced allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.\n\nA major component in ginger, 6-gingerol, suppresses the activation of T lymphocytes, or T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in sensitizing people to specific allergens, the researchers said.\n\nGinger is a popular spice produced from the root of the ginger plant, Zingiber officinale. Some herbal remedies for nausea and other ailments also contain ginger.\n\nExperiments in Japan involved mice fed a normal diet containing 2% powdered ginger or a control diet without ginger. After two weeks on the diets, the ginger-fed mice received two injections of purified egg proteins called ovalbumin (OVA) to stimulate allergic rhinitis symptoms. Control mice received either OVA or placebo injections.\n\nThe mice underwent an immune challenge two weeks later in which a small amount of OVA was inserted into the nose. Allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing, were counted for the next 10 minutes.\n\nMice in the ginger-fed group sneezed 2.1 times each, on average. This compares with 15.2 sneezes per mouse in the OVA-injected controls and roughly one sneeze in the placebo-injected animals. Fewer nasal rubbing movements were recorded in the ginger-fed mice compared with OVA-injected controls, but not the placebo group.\n\nGinger-fed mice had lower levels of immunoglobulin E, or IgE, a type of allergic antibody, and mast cells, which release chemicals called histamines that cause sneezing and other allergic symptoms, the study showed. T cells stimulate the production of IgE to specific allergens. IgE binds to receptors on mast cells, triggering the release of histamine.\n\nThe study used powdered ginger, the type used in cooking, containing 0.5% 6-gingerol. Previous studies suggest powdered ginger contains higher concentrations of 6-gingerol than fresh ginger, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The antiallergic effects of ginger may vary with the 6-gingerol content, researchers said. Ginger has not been tested on people with allergic rhinitis.\n\nPrevention of allergic rhinitis by ginger and the molecular basis of immunosuppression by 6-gingerol through T cell inactivation']","Clocking in at just over 350 words, this Wall Street Journal brief didn’t provide much context, but it covered the basics pretty well.","A mouse study from Japan showed that rodents that had been fed powdered ginger responded with fewer sneezes and had a lower level of immune response to an allergen. This short piece about the research earns praise for stating clearly in the subheadline and in the lead sentence that the study was conducted in mice. We wish more stories would take that simple step, so crucial to understanding these results. And while the story fell short of our standards by not including any context or independent sources, it did a pretty good job of explaining the science of measuring an allergic response and quantifying rodent sneeze rates. Overall, this was a pretty good effort at briefly summarizing rodent research in a way that’s accessible and useful for readers.

Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. The approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men. The work was completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland and was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“MRI has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring,” said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology. “The technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread, which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.”\n\nThe study, published online in the Aug. 12, 2015, issue of Nature Communications, was led by Zheng-Rong Lu, Ph.D., CWRU M. Frank Rudy and Margaret Domiter Rudy Professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases.\n\n“We showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells,” Lu said, adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries, revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities. “Our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. These are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer.”\n\nOne-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs, with an increased risk of death. Breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone, lung, liver, lymph nodes, and the brain. Since small, early-stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments, screening is an important aspect of follow-up care for breast cancer patients, and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth.\n\nThe earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu’s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging — which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images – and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution.\n\nThe contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide — a chain of just five amino acids — for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell’s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis.\n\nThe researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.\n\n“The primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,” Lu said. “By also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.”\n\nThe researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice.\n\nAnalysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm — the diameter of a very fine pencil lead.\n\nPrior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu’s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.\n\n“The recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,” said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection. “We think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.”\n\nThe team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years. They will then pursue human trials with this approach.\n\nThis work was supported in part by NIH grants EB00489.\n\nAbout the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering: NIBIB’s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.

The release deserves good marks for packing in a great deal of information about how cancer spreads and how this technology might potentially play a role in facilitating earlier detection. Nevertheless, we had some significant concerns with how the findings are presented to readers. Most troubling is that the release fails to note that the work was done in mice until about two-thirds of the way through. It’s simply misleading not to acknowledge that the research involved mice somewhere high up in the release rather than burying it far down in the document.
Another nugget missing from the early paragraphs is that it’s the “enhancement” (i.e. a new contrasting agent) rather than “MRI” itself that is of interest and novelty here. That could confuse readers who at first glance may be led to believe that standard MRI can now help physicians find these early new seeds of cancer, as well as predict their level of severity and presage their conquest.
Surprisingly, there is also no mention of the scientists’ claims that the work was the first demonstration of the effectiveness of this form of molecular MRI/contrast agent technology in the detection of breast cancer micrometastases. And there is little or no real quantification related to the sensitivity and specificity of the detection method, particularly as compared to current gold standard imaging or use of other biomarkers to detect breast cancer spread.
So despite some notable strengths, this release’s omissions and lack of attention to the most important findings and details make it overall a confusing and potentially misleading account of the research.

If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.\n\nTo prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.\n\nDoctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.\n\nUp to now, however, there\'s been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person\'s long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.\n\nIn this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military\'s Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.\n\nResearchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.\n\nAnalysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person\'s major arteries.\n\nPatients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.\n\n""This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,"" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nCalcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.\n\n""Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,"" he said. ""The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.""\n\nThe results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.\n\n""It can be a very potent motivator,"" she said.\n\nPeople with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.\n\nShaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person\'s regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests. They generally cost less than $100, she said.\n\n""I think it\'s headed that way,"" she said. ""We\'re kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted.""\n\nThe findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on coronary calcium scans, visit the U.S. National Institutes of Health.']","It’s one thing to predict risk, and another to show that acting on risk factors leads to improved health outcomes.","This story reports that testing generally healthy people for the presence of calcium deposits on the walls of their coronary arteries may provide clues about who is more likely to die over the following 15 years. That’s an interesting finding that was well worth writing about. However, the story then runs beyond the evidence to feed speculation that coronary artery calcification (CAC) scans could help improve treatments, something this study did not look at. We also have some concerns about the story’s description of the physiological aspects of heart disease.

Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,"" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nThis is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.\n\nResearchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women\'s Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.\n\nAfter adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:\n\n23 percent lower in all women,\n\n48 percent lower in black women,\n\n32 percent lower in Hispanic women,\n\n21 percent lower in white women, and\n\n19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.\n\n""If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,"" Jacobson said.\n\n""Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,"" Jacobson said.\n\nBecause the study was observational, it couldn\'t establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don\'t is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women\'s Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.\n\n""Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,"" Jacobson said.\n\nThe study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women\'s Health Initiative\'s exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.\n\nCurrently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.\n\n###\n\nFrontiers: The Heartland Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and the Wichita Center for Graduate Medical Education-Kansas Bioscience Authority funded the study.

The test, which is called single color digital PCR, requires only a fraction of a tube of blood and can detect as few as three mutation-bearing molecules in a single reaction. According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer.\n\n""For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. Nearly all cancer patients require monitoring by whole body imaging, which can be costly, complex, and time-consuming. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. Moreover, the test\'s rapid turnaround and relatively low cost, especially compared to next-generation DNA sequencing, provide a potential opportunity for universal monitoring of more patients than is currently done,"" explained lead investigator Hanlee P. Ji, MD, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at Stanford University and Senior Associate Director of the Stanford Genome Technology Center.\n\nThe report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients. Five patients were previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer and one with cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nAfter generation of customized mutation detection assays, the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients. In one patient, the assay was able to show the presence of three different mutations. The three patients, whose samples did not show elevated cancer DNA, were undergoing active treatment at the time of collection.\n\nThe single-color digital PCR test offers several advantages over other methods of circulating tumor DNA analysis, compared to next-generation targeted sequencing and fluorescent probe-based digital PCR assays. The main advantage is that the new technique does not rely on pre-amplification, which can introduce errors and biases.\n\n""This test is simple enough to set up and analyze without extensive training, and therefore, it can be implemented by anyone, making it highly accessible to any laboratory. It has been truly motivating to work with a technology that will help transform the way that we monitor and treat individuals with cancer. I am excited to share our findings with the cancer research community,"" noted lead author and researcher Christina Wood Bouwens, of the Stanford Genome Technology Center and the Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.\n\n###']",Sometimes less than 500 words just isn’t enough to give the right health context.,"There are 429 words in this news release.

As we discover new functions for the CDK4/6 target of this medicine, we are likely to use it in combinations to make other anti-cancer agents work better.""\n\nIn addition to inhibiting the cell cycle, palbociclib has been shown, for example to alter several recently described non-cell cycle functions of CDK4/6, a finding expected to expand its therapeutic role, O\'Dwyer added.\n\nAssessing 130 relevant publications in the literature, as well as interpreting their own continuing studies, the all-Penn team found that in addition to its safety and effectiveness in fighting certain types of breast cancer, early trials of palbociclib have shown promise of effectiveness in cases of lymphoma, sarcoma, and teratoma, tumors that while rare, often afflict younger patients.\n\nA phase 2 trial showed that, among 17 patients with previously treated mantle-cell lymphoma, palbociclib resulted in one complete response and two partial responses. Although, median progression-free survival was four months, five patients had progression-free survival greater than one year. Another phase 2 trial with 29 sarcoma patients treated with palbociclib showed a progression-free survival of 66 percent at 12 weeks.\n\nAlso, combining palbociclib with other anti-cancer agents is feasible, and early results in myeloma and some solid tumors have led to more definitive studies.\n\nIn both breast and other cancer trials, palbociclib has been shown to be safe with once-daily dosing, and its main adverse effect is reversible neutropenia, an abnormally low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. The lower their neutrophil count, the more vulnerable patients are to infectious diseases. In such cases the drug is temporarily discontinued and reintroduced at a lower dose. Other side effects included fatigue (33 percent), nausea (30 percent), diarrhea (18 percent), constipation (12 percent), and rash (12 percent).\n\nAt the recommended doses, evidence of the desired drug effect in tumors has been obtained using novel PET imaging at Penn. These tools can help to individualize patient therapy going forward.\n\n###\n\nOther Penn co-authors are Thomas B. Karasic, MD; Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE; David J.Vaughn, MD; Mark O\'Hara, MD; Rodolfo Perini, MD; Paul Zhang, MD; Priti Lal, MD; Michael Feldman, MD, PhD; and Maryann Gallagher, RN.\n\nThe study was funded by Pfizer Inc and the National Institutes of Health (5P30 CA16520-25).']",University of Pennsylvania release on tumor-inhibiting cancer drug shops new applications that haven’t been studied yet.,"This detailed news release from the University of Pennsylvania describes results of a literature review of small clinical trials that suggest far broader treatment possibilities for a type of cell-cycle or checkpoint inhibitor drug already approved by the FDA for its effectiveness against a form of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The drug, palbociclib, interferes with the hallmark rapid division of cancer cells by inhibiting two so-called cyclin-dependent kinases (or CDKs), the enzymes CDK4 and CDK6, which ramp up cell proliferation and are widely present in a variety of malignant tumors. These cell cycle saboteurs are the hot new focus of individualized cancer treatments because of their relatively non-toxic side effects and — alone and in combination with other drugs — their ability to extend progression-free survival. The release does a good job of noting the rapid emergence and track record of palbociclib, which is taken usually once a day by mouth, and its potential use in lymphoma, other forms of breast cancer, sarcomas and teratomas. The release would have been made stronger if it had included more information about the type of breast cancer palbociclib was approved for by the FDA (hormone receptor positive tumors), and about costs, along with more data about prevalence of the cancers it already treats and may have the potential to treat. We also think the release gets ahead of itself when talking in unqualified terms about the drug’s “potentially broad applicability” and “real promise for addressing a variety of cancers.” Those applications may pan out and then again they may not; the release only seems to consider the first possibility.

In a study of mice, the scientists showed that black tea alters energy metabolism in the liver by changing gut metabolites.\n\nThe research is published in the European Journal of Nutrition.\n\nThe study found that both black and green tea changed the ratio of intestinal bacteria in the animals: The percentage of bacteria associated with obesity decreased, while bacteria associated with lean body mass increased.\n\nPrevious studies indicated that chemicals in green tea called polyphenols are absorbed and alter the energy metabolism in the liver. The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver.\n\n""It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,"" said Susanne Henning, the study\'s lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.""\n\n""The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person\'s well-being,"" she said.\n\nIn the study, four groups of mice received different diets -- two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts:\n\nLow-fat, high-sugar High-fat, high-sugar High-fat, high-sugar and green tea extract High-fat, high-sugar and black tea extract\n\nAfter four weeks, the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the low-fat diet throughout the study.\n\nThe researchers also collected samples from the mice\'s large intestines (to measure bacteria content) and liver tissues (to measure fat deposits). In the mice that consumed either type of tea extract, there was less of the type of bacteria associated with obesity and more of the bacteria associated with lean body mass.\n\nHowever, only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called Pseudobutyrivibrio, which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism.\n\nDr. Zhaoping Li, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study\'s senior author, said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits, and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome.\n\n""For black tea lovers, there may be a new reason to keep drinking it,"" she said.\n\nThe findings build on a 2015 UCLA study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a high-fat, high-sugar diet.\n\n###\n\nThe new study also concluded that both green tea and black tea have different effects on liver metabolism. According to Henning, the molecules in green tea are smaller and can more readily be absorbed into the body and reach the liver directly, while black tea molecules are larger and stay in the intestine rather than being absorbed. When black tea molecules stay in the intestinal tract, they enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria and the formation of microbial metabolites involved in the regulation of energy metabolism.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition.']",This release extrapolates far too casually from mouse research to human application.,"This news release was based on a very preliminary four-week study of mice. But readers of the misleading headline — “Black tea may help with weight loss, too” — will assume that the results apply to humans.
The release attempts to quickly clarify the erroneous impression left by the headline, which is good. But then it later quotes a researcher who extrapolates far beyond what a mouse study can tell us when she says: “Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.”
Mice are not people, and the results reported here are very unlikely to apply to humans. We have consistently learned, through mounds of research that’s much more relevant to humans than this study, that there’s no single food or nutrient that yields sustainable weight loss in people.

However, it also has been shown to increase protein in the urine and its long-term safety will need further investigation.\n\nLike aspirin, salsalate is an anti-inflammatory drug derived from salicylate and is often used to treat arthritis. Researchers say the first reports of salicylate-based drugs aiding in the treatment of diabetes were published more than a century ago.\n\nMore recently, inflammation has been implicated in development of the insulin resistance that leads to elevated blood sugar levels associated with type 2 diabetes. Aspirin has also been shown to lower blood sugar levels, but the high doses required are associated with a risk of bleeding, which limits its utility.\n\nThat prompted researchers to take another look at salsalate in reducing blood sugar levels. Salsalate contains the same active ingredient as aspirin but is associated with fewer side effects.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers randomly assigned 108 people with type 2 diabetes to receive 3, 3.5, or 4 grams per day of salsalate or a placebo in addition to their current diabetes therapy for 14 weeks.\n\nThe results showed those who took salsalate at each of the dosage levels experienced a beneficial decrease in blood sugar A1c levels of 0.5% or more. Other markers of glycemic control and heart disease risk also improved in the three salsalate groups compared with the placebo group. No single dose of salsalate seemed safer or more effective than another.\n\nAlthough only minor side effects of salsalate use were reported, researchers say salsalate users tended to develop more protein in their urine. Elevated protein levels in the urine may indicate negative effects on kidney function.\n\nDue to the small size of the study and short follow-up time, researchers say it\'s too soon to recommend use of salsalate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. But the results do merit further research.\n\n""Because of salsalate\'s anti-inflammatory effects, our results suggest that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and that anti-inflammatory therapy may be useful for treating diabetes,"" write researchers Allison B. Goldfine, MD, of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, and colleagues. ""We are conducting a larger trial involving more patients with type 2 diabetes to further establish whether a salsalate dosage of 3.5g/day provides durable and safe control of blood glucose in this population.""']",A 429-word story that had a definite edge over a 240-word HealthDay story we also reviewed.  You can pack a lot more detail and context into those 189 words.  ,"This is the better of two articles we reviewed about a newly published study.

But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.\n\nThe visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.\n\nMs. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3—which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote—captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight’s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.\n\n“Being able to see that people’s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,” she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She’s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.\n\nEfforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.\n\nTo Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind “Next Generation” series character who wore a vision visor. “I remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,” says Ms. Felix, who is 36.\n\nThe eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight—along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes—is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.\n\nThe camera-equipped eSight 3, which weighs less than a quarter of a pound, uses VR-like displays to bring images close to the user's eyes. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen Ms. Felix allowed me to try on her visor, the images I saw were very high contrast, and the screens were positioned to allow me to also make use of my natural peripheral vision. The battery lasts about 6½ hours.\n\nUsing the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.\n\n“There is no device that’s a magic solution for all problems,” says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.\n\nNot everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. “It is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,” he says.\n\nESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn’t cover it.\n\n“That is a battle we are starting to wage,” says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.\n\nThe eSight 3 handheld controller lets the user zoom in or pan across signs and other objects. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal\n\n“Yes, that is an expensive piece of equipment, but it can really do a lot for people,” says Gislin Dagnelie, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins and an adviser to the company. While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight’s tech.\n\nFor an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.\n\nShe recalls the first time she saw “Starry Night” with her eSight visor on, it made her cry. “I saw every little stroke. When I saw the color mixtures and how thick the paint was, it was the most overwhelming moment of my life,” she says. “I thought that never in my life would I be able to see something so beautiful.”\n\nWrite to Geoffrey A. Fowler at geoffrey.fowler@wsj.com""]",This is a story that’s long on anecdote (from a company spokesperson) and short on medical evidence.,"This story takes a look at a purported simple visor, eSight, that can help the legally blind see—or at least 7-8% of them, and for the price of $10,000.
What the story does well: It discussed costs of the device not just in passing, but in depth. (It’s an important criteria many outlets whiff on in our reviews.)
However, what are the measured benefits, as seen from clinical evidence? The story says initial study results are due in May–why not wait until then to do the story?
We acknowledge that this story is categorized as a “personal technology” story, not a health news story. But it’s reviewable because it makes claims about an intervention for people. Such stories need data–not just a gee-whiz discussion of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster.

Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.\n\nA rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, MCC, is 35 times less common than melanoma, but on average, it is about three times more likely to be deadly. Until now, there were no systemic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this cancer, and no approved therapies once the cancer had spread.\n\nTom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. After being diagnosed with MCC in 2013, his cancer jumped from a small pimple on his nose throughout his body, growing until it interfered dangerously with organ function.\n\nBy early 2015, the disease had nearly killed him, despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug – avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared.\n\nBecause of the data from this clinical trial, avelumab (brand name Bavencio) has become the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for MCC, and the first treatment of any kind approved for metastatic MCC.\n\nDr. Paul Nghiem, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch, and the George F. Odland Endowed Chair in Dermatology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is a senior investigator on the clinical trial that led to the FDA approval and the senior author on the Lancet Oncology article that preceded the approval. He is a leading expert on MCC and a pioneer of immunotherapy for the disease.\n\nThe approval as a first- and second-line therapy “is a really big deal,” said Nghiem. His team foundational work on the role of immune cells in MCC paved the way for immunotherapy trials in the disease, including one he leads of another immunotherapy drug with a similar mechanism of action (Merck’s Keytruda), whose results were published last year and changed the field overnight.\n\nA practicing physician, he treats patients with MCC and other skin cancers at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutch’s clinical care partner. He is a consultant for EMD Serono Inc. and receives funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb to perform biomarker studies in MCC clinical trials.\n\n# # #\n\nAt Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first and largest cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network.

Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.\n\nLead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.\n\n""The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.\n\n""Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.\n\n""The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,"" Professor Cunningham said.\n\n""The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.\n\n""This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations.\n\n""What\'s particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.\n\n""We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,"" he said.\n\nShingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.\n\nThe vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.\n\nShingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body\'s natural immunity declines.\n\n""When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That\'s why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,"" Professor Cunningham said.\n\nMost Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox. By age 85, approximately 50% of the population will develop shingles. Vaccination is the only way to protect against shingles.\n\n###\n\nThe full paper is published online by the Journal of Infectious Diseases as Editor\'s choice: https:/ / academic. oup. com/ jid/ advance-article/ doi/ 10. 1093/ infdis/ jiy095/ 4911103\n\nThe Shingrix vaccine is developed by GlaxoSmithKline.']",The news release also omits cost and harms.,"This news release describes the results of a published study that examined how well a new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, provoked immune responses during clinical trials led by researchers in Australia.

Women who had a reduction in their hot flashes saw a benefit beginning after about three to four weeks of weekly treatments.”\n\nThe National Institutes of Health-funded study was designed to examine different patterns of responses to acupuncture. Participants included 209 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women ages 45 to 60 who had on average at least four hot flashes or night sweats per day. Women were randomized to receive up to 20 acupuncture treatments within six months or to a control group.\n\nOf the 170 women who received acupuncture, a small group of women (11.9 percent) had an 85 percent reduction in hot flashes by the eighth week of the study, Avis said. Forty-seven percent of the study group reported a 47 percent reduction over this same time frame. However, 37 percent showed only a minimal reduction of 9.6 percent in frequency of hot flashes, while 4 percent reported a 100 percent increase in hot flashes. “We had hoped to identify some of the characteristics of the women who benefitted from acupuncture, but like so many treatments, we could not really tell ahead of time who would benefit,” Avis said.

Most importantly, the release did not reveal that the study wasn’t blinded and that there was no sham acupuncture given to the control group, making this a weak study. It’s well established that acupuncture can produce beneficial effects on a wide array of health problems; the issue is whether these effects differ from what would be expected with a placebo or sham treatment.

Shapiro, MD, PhD, director of the Early Drug Development Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\nBackground: In February 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) for use in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.\n\nThe oral CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib is a very different molecule from palbociclib, with distinct attributes that contribute to its discrete therapeutic effects, in particular, its single-agent activity, according to Shapiro. For example, abemaciclib has greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with palbociclib, which may explain why it does not affect white blood cell counts as severely, allowing it to be taken on a continuous schedule without treatment holidays, he said. Abemaciclib also penetrates the central nervous system, whereas palbociclib does not, raising the possibility that it could be used to treat primary or metastatic brain tumors, he added.\n\nHow the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. In the dose escalation phase, the researchers determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 200 milligrams (mg) every 12 hours; the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue.\n\nIn the expansion phase, single-agent abemaciclib was administered to 47 patients with breast cancer, 68 with NSCLC, 17 with glioblastoma, 26 with melanoma, and 15 with colorectal cancer. Among these patients, the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, kidney dysfunction, and decreased red and white blood cell counts.\n\nRadiographic responses were observed for some patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. Among the 36 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 11 had a partial response, with four of the 11 responders having continued prior endocrine therapy, and an additional 18 patients had stable disease. Among the 68 patients with NSCLC, two had a partial response and 31 had stable disease; one patient who had a partial response and 12 who had stable disease were known to have KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Among the 26 patients with melanoma, one had a partial response and six had stable disease. Three of the 17 patients with glioblastoma had stable disease, with two of them continuing to receive treatment without disease progression for 19 and 23 cycles, respectively.\n\nAuthor Comment: ""These data show that abemaciclib is an oral drug that can be taken on a continuous schedule and achieve durable clinical activity against multiple tumors including breast and lung cancers,"" said Shapiro.\n\n""The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer,"" added Patnaik.\n\nLimitations: Patnaik explained that because this study included 225 patients with different types of cancer, confirmatory clinical trials in specific patient populations are necessary to precisely define the role of abemaciclib in cancer care. Multiple clinical trials have already been initiated to evaluate abemaciclib as a treatment for certain groups of patients with breast cancer and NSCLC, as well as children with primary brain tumors and adults with brain metastases, she noted.\n\n###\n\nFunding & Disclosures: The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.

This release teeters a bit but ends up making the stick.,"This release about the first set of tests in patients prescribed an experimental cancer drug, abemaciclib, uses language that mostly hews to the careful tone of the researchers’ journal article. It does not make any premature claims of cure or even extended survival. The release includes sections labeled “Limitations” and “Funding & Disclosures” that highlight these vital elements. We would have liked to see at least some discussion of the possible cost of the drug, especially since a similar drug mentioned in the release is priced around $10,000/month. The release could have explicitly noted that the new drug could fail ongoing trials, instead of using language that implies eventual success. Even with expedited status and favorable study results, it would likely be 1-3 years before this drug could be approved for routine use.

An approval for Crohn’s would give the drug entry into an estimated $1.3 billion U.S. market and $2.7 billion market worldwide.\n\nThe intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response — defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) — after six weeks of treatment.\n\nThat compared with a response rate of 23.5 percent of patients who received a placebo.\n\nTwo lower doses of Stelara were also tested in the study of 526 patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who were not helped by, or could not tolerate, treatment with a widely used class of drugs known as TNF antagonists, such as Abbott Laboratories’ Humira.\n\nThose who received 1 mg/kg had a 36.6 percent response rate and the 3 mg/kg dose led to a 34.1 percent response rate.\n\n“To see these kind of outcomes, where you have high response rates in the short term and then good remission rates out toward five or six months of therapy, it shows unequivocally that the drug is effective for treating Crohn’s disease,” said Dr. William Sandborn, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago on Sunday.\n\n“It’s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,” Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs.\n\nHe said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. “They’ll feel measurably better.”\n\n“The patient population was really quite ill and had very high disease activity, and despite that we saw nice response rates,” Sandborn said.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, those who responded to Stelara after six weeks of treatment were given either a 90-mg injection of Stelara at week eight and week 16 or a placebo.\n\nAfter 22 weeks, 69.4 percent of the Stelara patients maintained a clinical response and 41.7 percent were deemed to be in clinical remission. That compared with 42.5 percent who maintained a clinical response and a 27.4 percent remission rate in the placebo group.\n\nClinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said.\n\nCrohn’s is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects an estimated 700,000 Americans. Common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and it can lead to bowel perforations. Many Crohn’s patients require surgery when medicines no longer control symptoms.\n\nThe rate of infections and other serious side effects was similar in the Stelara and placebo groups, researchers said.\n\n“We’ll need more patients and longer-term data to really fully characterize the safety profile in Crohn’s disease, but so far so good,” Sandborn said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story did a nice job with the criteria it covered, but we think what’s missing matters.</span>", ,3,real

University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nIn a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke.\n\n""We\'re very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,"" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn\'s School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. ""For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications.""\n\nThe research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine\'s psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa.\n\nAt Penn\'s Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA\'s director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what\'s commonly called their executive functions.\n\n""They feel fuzzy. They\'re forgetful,"" Ashare said. ""Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further.""\n\nThat\'s when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\n\nIn the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking\'s rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine\'s effects.\n\nSchmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs.\n\nFor both drugs, ""we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,"" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat.\n\n""We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,"" he said. ""We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn\'t because the rats were sick.""\n\nUnlike humans who can verbally report when they don\'t feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs.\n\n""At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,"" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60.\n\nPeople who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers\' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo.\n\n""That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,"" Ashare said.\n\nShe\'s still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she\'ll dig into overall quit data. What she\'s learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don\'t smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently.\n\n""Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,"" she said. ""We know that they\'re effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits.""\n\nThere\'s no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit.\n\nAshare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry.\n\n###']",Generally solid discussion of an early study on repurposing an Alzheimer’s drug to help with smoking cessation.,"This news release describes a report on an ongoing trial of the Alzheimer’s drug galantamine as a smoking cessation aid. The release also notes that the study on which it’s based sought to explore whether the drug would have less of an effect on participants’ “executive functions” while going through withdrawal than other methods since many people in the process of giving up tobacco experience forgetfulness and “fuzziness,” according to the release. The release does a good overall job of describing the researchers’ long-range thinking and goals with the study, and the release is clear that this approach could have downsides and side effects. The release would have been stronger had it talked about about costs and discussed how this approach compares with the alternatives.

As a result, we set out to conduct a systematic search of all the scientific literature.""\n\nThe team\'s review looked at all of the available data including five randomised trials and forty two observational studies of colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.\n\nProfessor Elwood said: ""Our review, based on the available evidence, suggests that low-dose aspirin taken by patients with bowel, breast or prostate cancer, in addition to other treatments, is associated with a reduction in deaths of about 15-20%, together with a reduction in the spread of the cancer.\n\n""The results from six studies of other cancers also suggest a reduction, but the numbers of patients were too few to enable confident interpretation. A mutation - known as PIK3CA - was present in about 20% of patients, and appeared to explain much of the reduction in colon cancer mortality by aspirin.\n\n""One of the concerns about taking aspirin remains the potential for intestinal bleeding. That\'s why we specifically looked at the available evidence of bleeding and we wrote to all authors asking for further data. In no study was serious or life-threatening bleeding reported.""\n\nAs a result of the review, the team say their study highlights the need for randomised trials to establish the evidence needed to support low-dose aspirin as an effective additional treatment of cancer.\n\nProfessor Elwood added: ""While there is a desperate need for more detailed research to verify our review and to obtain evidence on less common cancers, we\'d urge patients diagnosed with cancer to speak to their doctor about our findings so they can make an informed decision as to whether or not they should take a low-dose aspirin as part of their cancer treatment.""\n\nThis is not the only significant study Professor Elwood led research examining ways to improve peoples\' health. In 1974 Elwood\'s team reported the very first randomised trial of aspirin in the prevention of vascular mortality in the British Medical Journal.\n\nProfessor Elwood also led a major study which monitored the health habits of 2,235 men over a 35-year period and found that exercise significantly reduces the risk of dementia. The study was the longest of its kind to probe the influence of environmental factors in chronic disease.\n\nThe study identified five healthy behaviours as being integral to having the best chance of leading a disease-free lifestyle: taking regular exercise, non-smoking, a healthy bodyweight, a healthy diet and a low alcohol intake.\n\n###']",This news release presents findings from a review of dozens of studies on aspirin as a cancer treatment fairly — but left a few holes.,"Aspirin is one of the most well-studied drugs on the planet, in terms of treating headaches, aches, and pains as well as in helping out those who are at risk of heart disease — the biggest killer of people in developed nations. This release promotes a study that looks at the common drug’s effect on the second-biggest killer, which is cancer.
The meta-analysis crunched the data of five randomized trials and 42 smaller studies that focused on colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers and — most importantly — the effect of a low-dose aspirin regimen on the survival of those patients, as well as how their cancer spread over a period of about 5 years.
The correlation is eyebrow-raising, with a reduction in death and cancer spread in the neighborhood of about 20%.
On the downside, this release doesn’t really get into what might be causing this reduction, or even define what “low-dose aspirin” means. It also doesn’t adequately discuss the risks (e.g. bleeding, allergies, and stomach ulcers) and skips over a couple of other basics that would have been helpful to journalists and readers alike.

Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nVitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.\n\n""To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,"" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. ""In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,"" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. ""This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.""\n\nCompared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.\n\n""Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,"" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. ""This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.""\n\nVitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure. Experts recommend vitamin D be obtained through diet whenever possible because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer.\n\n###\n\nArticle: Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk: An International Pooling Project of 17 Cohorts.

The main finding: higher circulating vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer.
The release provides a careful and appropriately cautious overview that explains why the study is newsworthy. This document should set the stage for balanced and informative coverage from news organizations.

Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.\n\nWomen taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.\n\nMiller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.\n\nAbaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.\n\nAlong with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. ""Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,"" Miller said.\n\nHe predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.\n\n""I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,"" he said. ""Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don\'t have insurance."" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.\n\nThe report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.\n\nFor the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.\n\nAmong the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.\n\nIn addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.\n\nThere were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.\n\nDr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.\n\n""Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,"" she said, adding that this is an early study. ""It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.""\n\nAn editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.\n\n""The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,"" the editorial said.\n\nThe editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about osteoporosis, visit the American College of Rheumatology.']",Here’s a case where the primary endpoints should have been closely paid attention to when reporting on the findings.,"The story reports on research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association studying an experimental drug known as abaloparatide and its ability to prevent a new vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
A standout positive for this story is its choice to report the absolute risk, rather than relative risk, of fracture due to low bone density (see Disease Mongering criterion below). Read more on why this matters.
But, there are a few problems concerning the subtleties of the study design. Specifically, the research study was not powered to detect significant differences between abaloparatide and its currently-available competitor, Forteo (teriparatide). Thus, any juxtaposition of quantitative figures comparing the efficacy of the two drugs must be presented with important caveats, which we didn’t see emphasized enough in the news story.
Instead, the story leads with a claim that abaloparatide reduces fracture risk “better” than the competing drug–something the study wasn’t designed to address and which is misleading.
We’d note that a JAMA news release about the study, which we also reviewed, largely sidesteps this issue by avoiding any statements that directly compare the two drugs. But could the release have helped reporters out here by making a clear, unambiguous statement regarding the purpose of the study and its limitations? The researchers include such a statement in the text of the research article itself (see below under the “Evidence” criterion), and in hindsight it seems that the news release would have done well to emphasize this key nuance.
Another way journalists can avoid this problem? Emphasize the findings related to the study’s primary endpoints, and always read the study’s discussion and limitations sections to find important caveats. Accompanying editorials also often have illuminating points to make, too.

REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nEarlier studies had suggested that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help protect against colorectal cancer, but it wasn’t clear how much had to be taken, and for how long, to achieve those benefits.\n\nNow, using data on more than 113,000 individuals, researchers have been trying to sort out the relationship between aspirin and NSAIDs, duration of treatment, and colorectal cancer rates.\n\nIn general, the risk of developing colorectal cancer varies with age, race, ethnicity and lifestyle. More than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people older than 50, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAn online risk calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available here: 1.usa.gov/1DlscTL) indicates that in the U.S., for an average white or black woman in her late fifties, the 10-year risk of developing colorectal cancer is between 1 and 1.4 percent, and her lifetime risk is between 5 and 5.4 percent. For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.\n\nIn the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n“Unless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,” Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.\n\nNonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said.\n\nAspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.\n\nThe study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors’ prescriptions. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can’t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants’ risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.\n\nDr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.\n\n“Self-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,” Dr. Friis said. “The public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.”\n\nDr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.\n\n“Low dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,” he told Reuters Health by email. But “before starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1i46lF7 Annals of Internal Medicine, online August 24, 2015.']",A very effective report that gives readers most everything they need to know about the study.,"A strong story that describes in clear terms the findings as well as the strengths and weaknesses of this study. It covered potential biases that could not be controlled, mentioned harms, and was overall very cautious. It would have been even stronger had it mentioned that the study was observational in nature and therefore not capable of telling us whether the aspirin, or some other factor, is responsible for the benefit that was seen. It also did not mention alternatives for colorectal cancer prevention such as proven effective screening practices. But these are relatively minor omissions in coverage that was otherwise quite exemplary.

The study, ""Pretreatment fasting plasma glucose and insulin modify dietary weight loss success: results from 3 randomized clinical trials,"" found that fasting blood sugar and/or fasting insulin can be used to select the optimal diet and to predict weight loss, particularly for people with prediabetes or diabetes.\n\nThe research analyzed data from three diet clinical trials which collectively looked at more than 1,200 individuals - Diet, Obesity, and Genes (DiOGenes); the OPUS Supermarket intervention (SHOPUS); and the Nutrient-gene interactions in human obesity (NUGENOB). The findings suggest that for most people with prediabetes, a diet rich with vegetables fruits and wholegrains should be recommended for weight loss and could potentially improve diabetes markers. For people with type 2 diabetes, the analysis found that a diet rich in healthy fats from plant sources would be effective for achieving weight loss. These diets could also be effective independent of caloric restriction.\n\nTwo simple biomarkers with a large effect\n\n""Recognizing fasting plasma glucose as a key biomarker enables a new interpretation of the data from many previous studies, which could potentially lead to a breakthrough in personalized nutrition,"" said Arne Astrup, M.D., Head of Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports at University of Copenhagen. ""The beauty of this concept is its simplicity. While we are looking into other biomarkers, it is quite amazing how much more we can do for our patients just by using those two simple biomarkers. We will continue to participate in and support research to explore additional biomarkers such as gut microbiota and genomics approaches, which may offer more insights and help to more effectively customize the right diet for specific individuals.""\n\nThe latest findings, as reported in AJCN, have garnered international support with further analysis conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado, Tufts University, and Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBER OBN). Presented at the American Diabetes Association\'s 77th Scientific Sessions on June 11, 2017, the additional research includes an examination of patients in the Prevencion Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED Study), a Randomized Trial of a Low-CHO Diet for Obesity (CHO Study), and The Healthy Weight for Living Study. The different studies (six in total) employed a variety of nutrition strategies, including caloric restriction and ad libitum diets, varying the contributions of carbohydrate and fat, and increasing fiber intake.\n\nThe study was inspired by a finding in an early trial of Gelesis100, a novel hydrogel which demonstrated pronounced weight loss in people with prediabetes. The latest findings, as published in AJCN, concluded that a personalized nutritional approach based on an individual\'s biomarkers will lead to improved weight loss and maintenance success. The University of Copenhagen will continue to collaborate with the study\'s authors and other experts to advance this research and help find solutions for people around the world who struggle with weight loss.\n\n###\n\nContact:\n\nAssistant professor Mads Fiil Hjorth\n\nDepartment of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen\n\nEmail: madsfiil@nexs.ku.dk\n\nTel.: 45-4097-8366\n\nHead of Department,\n\nProfessor Arne Astrup, MD, DMSc\n\nDepartment of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen\n\nEmail: ast@nexs.ku.dk\n\nTel.: 45-2143-3302\n\nAbout the University of Copenhagen\n\nWith over 40,000 students and more than 9,000 employees, the University of Copenhagen is the largest institution of research and education in Denmark. The purpose of the University - to quote the University Statute - is to \'conduct research and provide further education to the highest academic level\'. Approximately one hundred different institutes, departments, laboratories, centres, museums, etc., form the nucleus of the University.\n\nThe Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports conducts research, education, innovation, and dissemination of information in nutrition, human physiology and sports at the highest international level, and incorporates the humanities as well as health and social sciences.']","If you’re going to claim “a breakthrough in personalized nutrition,” you need the numbers to back it up.","Findings from a trio of clinical trials suggest that fasting blood sugar and fasting insulin levels — two types of “biomarkers” — can be used to customize weight loss diets for people with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes, according to a news release from the University of Copenhagen.
The release doesn’t say how effective the biomarkers, which like surrogate markers are representative stand-ins for actual health outcomes, were in predicting and bringing about weight loss. (Read our explainer on the downsides of surrogate markers here.) The release would have been greatly improved had it included some numbers available from the published report which explained the benefits, provided some cost considerations for this type of personalized treatment, and included information on study funders and potential conflicts of interest.

And it might actually work.","['Every month, some 50 percent of women suffer from monthly period-related pain. And there\'s not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg recently stepped in with a new line of medical marijuana–based edibles and bath products (of questionable effectiveness) aimed at this underserved market.\n\nNow there\'s Livia, a medical device that\'s being marketed as the ""off switch for menstrual pain.""\n\nHere\'s how it works: Users simply attach two electrodes to the areas on their abdomen that hurt and switch on the colorful, palm-size gadget. According to Livia\'s makers, the device immediately sends nerve-stimulating electric pulses through the two electrodes, and poof! — the pain is gone.\n\nLivia has received rave reviews in international women\'s magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia\'s Indiegogo campaign. For now, it\'s only possible to preorder the device (at a cost of $85) and wait six months for it to ship.\n\nAs far as gadgetry for women\'s health goes, this one is novel. But does Livia actually work? There\'s no good way to evaluate that right now, since Livia\'s makers haven\'t made the findings of their studies on the device\'s effects public.\n\nBut there\'s some reason for optimism: The device is basically a repackaging of another (cheaper) technology that has already been proven to help women who suffer with their monthly cycles.\n\nLivia is essentially TENS 2.0\n\nTo learn more about Livia, I reached out to Chen Nachum, the company\'s founder and CEO. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you\'ve probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. (They\'re also available on the internet\'s strip mall, Amazon.)\n\nTENS devices are generally thought to work through the ""pain-gate theory"" of pain. ""The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,"" Nachum explained, ""so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body\'s frequency, but it\'s not something the body knows.""\n\nWhen the frequency from the device hits the brain faster than the pain, the brain takes that signal first and is distracted from the menstrual aches, the company claims.\n\nSo far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials — and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women.\n\n\n\nBased on these studies, Nachum is trying to get Food and Drug Administration approval to market Livia as a menstrual pain reliever.\n\nDoctors already prescribe TENS for period pain\n\nJen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there\'s enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: ""High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.""\n\nIn an email, Gunter said she frequently prescribes high-frequency TENS (pulses between 50 and 120 hertz at a low intensity) to treat patients who suffer through their periods: ""I have done so for more than 15 years. Prescribed one this morning in fact."" They really help some women, she added.\n\nThe benefit here is that, unlike anti-inflammatories and oral contraceptives, TENS is a non-drug intervention, and according to the Cochrane Review, there\'s research that suggests women even take fewer pain relievers when using these devices.\n\nGunter\'s main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. ""Nothing [the CEO] has disclosed makes Livia sound like anything other than a TENS unit,"" she wrote. ""So I guess it\'s an expensive, pink TENS unit?""\n\n\n\n(The company says the device would retail at $149, about the cost of four TENS units. But this assumes Livia will take off enough to justify retailing.)\n\n\n\nGunter also wondered whether Livia will be high frequency enough to be helpful. As that Cochrane review found, low-frequency TENS don\'t seem to do much to cut pain for women.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Nachum about the device\'s frequency, he said, ""We can\'t share this information at this point.""\n\n\n\nAnd while he claims that Livia is more effective at treating period pain than the cheaper, already available TENS units (he said ""its frequency and wave shape are unique and optimized especially for relieving menstrual pain""), without publicly available studies comparing the two, all we have to go on is his word. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn\'t comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)\n\n\n\nFor now, Gunter pointed out, the TENS units that are already available can help women — and raising awareness about that might be Livia\'s biggest benefit.\n\n""If [Livia] gets more women to know about TENS, then great,"" she said. ""[B]ut to call it something new or different seems disingenuous, unless of course they have published ... data that says otherwise.""']","With a dose of healthy skepticism, this story provides the reader with a complete discourse on the merits of this new device.","This is a story about a new device coming to market for menstrual pain. The story is a great example of how the media should deal with claims made about new devices. With a dose of healthy skepticism, the story provides the reader with a complete discourse on the merits of the device and of TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) in general.  We welcomed that skepticism across the board and appreciated the grounding comments of an independent source. Bravo.

Many are tempted to get a CT lung scan, costing $300 to $1,000, to see if something\'s lurking.\n\nA CT scan of the lungs picks up signals of cancer. (iStockphoto.com)\n\nThe idea has obvious appeal. After all, up to 30 percent of lung malignancies have already spread by the time they\'re diagnosed. And CT scans can detect tumors smaller than a pea. Small and early should mean curable, right?\n\nWell, it\'s not so simple. An analysis of lung cancer screening results in 3,200 people from the National Cancer Institute finds that 21 to 33 percent of the suspicious nodules found by CT scans are false alarms. They\'re not really cancer.\n\nThese ""false positives"" cause a good deal of anxiety, of course. To clear up the mystery, seven percent of patients undergo bronchoscopy -- a procedure involving a tube threaded into the lungs -- or have needles stuck into their lungs to retrieve a biopsy sample. Or they undergo exploratory lung surgery.\n\nPatients who undergo screening with conventional chest x-rays have false positives too, but less often -- 15 percent after two rounds of screening.\n\nThese false-positive rates may be under-estimates, say NCI officials, because in the study only lung nodules larger than 4 millimeters across (about an 0.16 inches) are followed up. Smaller ones are thought to pose minimal risk. But in typical medical practice, all suspicious nodules are usually investigated.\n\nThe results appear in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe extra scans and biopsies triggered by a false positive add around $1,100 per patient to the cost of lung cancer screening. They also expose people to additional radiation, which can cause cancer itself.\n\nThe false-positive problem is only one of the issues surrounding lung cancer screening. Experts worry that some malignancies might never pose a risk to patients, leading to unnecessary treatment.\n\nIt\'s also not clear whether the increased survival times reported in some studies among patients whose lung cancer was detected through screening may only reflect that a tumor was found earlier, not that death was really delayed. Experts call this ""lead-time bias.""\n\nThe NCI is running a clinical trial in which 53,000 current and former smokers were randomly assigned to get CT scans or chest x-rays to screen for lung cancer. The National Lung Screening Trial is designed to see if one test is better than another in terms of preventing death from lung cancer.\n\nThe results are expected sometime in the next year or two.']","Accurate, informative and concise.  Solid five-star story. ","An article published in the Annals of Internal Medicine  adds new fuel to the debate over the utility of lung cancer screening. The ongoing results of the National Lung Screening Trial from the National Cancer Institute are highly anticipated and many hope it will bring some clarity to this controversial topic. The full results won’t be available for another year or two, however this week’s publication provides a look at an important drawback of screening: false positive results. Preliminary results show that up to a third of all suspicious nodules found on CT scan were not actually cancer. For the patient, this means unnecessary anxiety, additional follow-up testing, and potentially risky and invasive procedures. Fundamentally, whether or not screening the benefits of screening justify these risks remains to be seen.
This story, in relatively few words, is notably strong in describing these risks, not only in quantitative terms, but in terms that are meaningful to someone considering screening.

The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.\n\nWhile sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.\n\n""While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,"" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.""\n\nClark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.\n\n""We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,"" Clark says.\n\n""Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,"" Clark adds.\n\nThe goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. ""We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,"" he says. ""It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain.""\n\nAt least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.\n\nPhotophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.\n\nIn addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.\n\n""We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,"" Clark says. ""The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting.""\n\n###\n\nAdditional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.\n\nThere was no funding used for this study.']",More data and details would have made for a stronger news release.,"This release offers few details on the actual benefits and evidence of wearing colored lenses to reduce light sensitivity following a concussion. There is no cost information, no comparison to alternatives (although alternatives are mentioned), no specific results on how patients fared in reducing light sensitivity and little in the way of description of the study.
To the casual reader, one might think that there’s a story here. But that’s what makes the lack of information so problematic. One can almost see the headlines: “Have a concussion? Look at life through rose-colored glasses.” With no proof in this release, reporters and readers can be misled into thinking that these findings are a bigger deal than they really are.

If that feels a little onerous, consider new findings out of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb.\n\nSo maybe women who won’t exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby.\n\nThe research in question involved mice, not women. A team led by Robert A. Waterland, an assistant professor of pediatrics, nutrition and molecular and human genetics, selected female mice that enjoyed running, according to a press release. (“Enjoyed”? Did they smile?) Half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy; the other half had no wheels.\n\nThe mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night, decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy. The offspring of those mothers turned out to be about 50 percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadn’t had the exercise wheel option. And that difference persisted into mouse adulthood.\n\nHow does this relate to our own species?\n\nObservational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported “results consistent with ours,” Waterland said. But in the human studies, it wasn’t always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity. The Baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables.\n\n“Our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation,” Waterland said. “I think our results offer a very positive message. If expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies, I think they will be more motivated to get moving.”']",A story on a small mouse study should come with lots of caution on generalizing to humans. This was not the case here.,"
This is a quick story about the findings from a small study of pregnant mice. The study showed that mice given the opportunity to exercise during pregnancy (by running on a wheel) had offspring that were more physically active than the offspring of pregnant mice who were not permitted to exercise.
This story was concerning on several fronts:
We suggest an alternate message for moms:  Wait for larger, controlled human studies before buying into such a link. And we would urge on all of us a greater degree of skepticism for news releases that promote such generalizations on the basis of a small study.

In absolute terms, it meant that vitamin takers developed fewer than two of these cancers on average versus roughly 2.5 cancers for the others.\n\nThe study did not involve melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Instead, it aimed at more common forms — basal and squamous cell cancers. More than 3 million cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.\n\n""These are sort of the run-of-the-mill skin cancers that so many people get,"" said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, an organization of cancer specialists. ""They\'re rarely lethal but they\'re very persistent and they keep coming back,"" and are expensive to remove, usually through surgery, freezing off the spots or radiation.\n\nHe and other doctors with the oncology group said the vitamin, called nicotinamide, could offer a cheap, easy way to lower risk.\n\nHowever, Australia has higher rates of skin cancer than the U.S. and other parts of the world, and some doctors may want more evidence beyond this single study before recommending the pills. Vitamins have long proved elusive for cancer prevention, and some studies have even found certain ones can be harmful.\n\nResearchers also stressed they were not suggesting vitamin use for people who have not yet had one of these cancers.\n\n""At the moment, it\'s not something for the general population,"" said the study\'s leader, Dr. Diona Damian of the Dermatology University of Sydney in Australia.\n\n""We must always remember the basics of sun-sensible behaviors"" — avoiding overexposure and using sunscreen — as the best ways for anyone to lower risk, she said.\n\nThe study involved 386 people who had at least two skin cancers in the previous five years. They took either 500 milligrams of the vitamin or dummy pills twice a day for a year. Neither they nor their doctors knew who got what until the study ended.\n\nBesides reducing the rate of skin cancers, vitamin use also seemed to cut the rate of precancers — scaly patches of skin called actinic keratoses — by 11 percent after three months of use and 20 percent after nine months.\n\nParticipants were tracked for six months after they stopped taking their pills, and the rate of new skin cancers was similar in both groups.\n\n""The benefit wears off fairly quickly,"" Damian said. ""You need to continue taking the tablets for them to continue to be effective.""\n\nNicotinamide (nih-kuh-TEE\'-nuh-myd) is thought to help repair DNA in cells damaged by sun exposure. It is not the same as nicotine, the addictive stuff in tobacco. It\'s also not the same as niacin and some other forms of B3, which can cause flushing, headaches and blood pressure problems. Those problems were not seen with nicotinamide in the study.\n\nNicotinamide is sold over the counter, is easy to take, and ""there are essentially no side effects,"" Schilsky said.']",The story wasn’t content simply to repeat the information that was spoonfed to reporters in a conference call.,"It’s an attractive idea: Take a cheap, harmless, over-the-counter pill twice a day and lower your chance of developing skin cancer. But as this well-balanced Associated Press (AP) news story illustrates, the results of a new study of Australian cancer patients who took nicotinamide — a type of B vitamin — are nowhere near that simple. First, the article explains that the benefit is quite modest in absolute terms and applies only to people who’ve had recurrent basal and squamous skin cancers — not people with more-lethal melanoma skin cancer, nor those without skin cancer who are trying to prevent getting it in the first place. Second, nicotinamide is sometimes confused with niacin, another B vitamin with more side effects. Third, the modest protection tapered off rapidly once study participants stopped taking nicotinamide. The story responsibly indicates that typical preventative methods — limiting exposure, shade, and sunscreen — are tried and true.
Although AP’s coverage is clearly superior to the competing CBS story on the same study, both pieces could have done a better job explaining that the findings — based on a conference abstract that has yet to be presented — haven’t undergone full peer review and should be considered preliminary until they are published in a journal.

Off the campaign trail, there\'s intense debate over using opioid meds to kick opioid addiction.\n\nBraeburn Pharmaceuticals\n\nScott Jernigan became addicted to painkillers after his failed back surgery. His doctor had prescribed a month’s worth of OxyContin, the signature drug of the nationwide painkiller addiction epidemic, and Jernigan followed it to the letter. Soon, the well-off businessman, husband, and father of two from Florida was an addict, buying pills on the street. In the last year of addiction, Jernigan snorted away a house, a boat, and almost his life. Even his dealer told him he needed to cut back. “A drug dealer telling you, ‘Hey man, you really ought to slow down,’” Jernigan, 52, told BuzzFeed News. “Can you imagine?” He’s just one of an estimated 2.1 million people across the United States who are addicted to opioid painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone (sold as OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively). Every day, 44 Americans die from a painkiller overdose. The central irony of the painkiller ""pandemic,"" as Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire called it in a January Senate hearing, is that it’s easy to prescribe painkillers but hard to prescribe medication to treat an addiction. These medications, notably the drug buprenorphine, are not panaceas, but studies have shown that they’re the best choice to help addicts get off painkillers. Trouble is, they’re also opioids themselves, and can result in dependency and highs all on their own, turning into street drugs in the last decade. Partly as a result, relatively few doctors are allowed to prescribe them, and these docs are limited in how many recovering addicts they can treat. In Shaheen’s Feb. 9 primary state of New Hampshire, the drug epidemic ranks as the No. 1 concern of voters in polls. There, presidential candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are calling for treating addiction as “a disease, not a moral failing.” And a move is afoot in Congress and the White House to ease restrictions on medications meant to fight addiction. Last Tuesday, the Obama administration announced that it is seeking $1.1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, including a $920 million boost to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. And on Thursday, the FDA unveiled a new strategy for curbing rampant painkiller prescriptions, which includes making medication treatments more widely available. “I think the situation is sinking in,” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon told BuzzFeed News. “It is so out of control, and there is a real opportunity for action in this Congress.” Pharma, meanwhile, is ramping up its marketing of these medications, pitching them as pain relievers themselves and releasing new forms such as a patch and a mint-flavored tablet. One new option awaiting FDA approval, an implant, Jernigan credits with saving his life.\n\nTwo years into Jernigan’s addiction, at a stage when he was getting high only to stave off withdrawal, listless and miserable, another addict told him about a study a drug company was sponsoring at a nearby rehab center testing buprenorphine pills as a quitting aid. “I called on a Thursday and they said they had no openings. I was crushed,” Jernigan said. “Then they called back and said they had a sudden opening on Monday. I was very lucky.” Indeed, most addicts don’t get that opportunity. At the Senate hearing, politicians from both parties voiced outrage over the statistic that only about 1 in 5 prescription painkiller addicts who want help can gain entrance into a recovery program that offers them both medication and counseling, the best proven way to recover from addiction. (Many instead end up in dodgy rehab centers that quickly detox addicts, but don’t offer them medication or counseling to keep them from relapsing.) “I’m incredibly discouraged that we have more folks signing up for addiction treatment in Vermont now than we did when we started,” Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin testified, decrying the FDA’s recent approval of oxycodone for children. “We simply pass out painkillers like candy in America.” To counteract addictions to prescription painkillers (as well as heroin, their chemical cousin), Shumlin called for allowing nurses and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine, something they can readily do now for painkillers. The idea was seconded by senators from both parties. Since its approval in 2002, buprenorphine has become a leading medication for treating opioid addiction. Although it’s a chemical cousin to opioid painkillers and heroin, it provides less euphoria while saturating the brain’s opiate receptors, making it nearly impossible to overdose or get high off of other opiate drugs, like heroin. Most often it is sold as the drug Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, which blocks the high from other opioids to prevent misuse) in the form of strips that dissolve under the tongue, although it is also sold in generic tablets. Essentially buprenorphine serves as a bridge to stave off the pain of withdrawal. “You can’t quit when you are feeling sick,” said Jernigan, who started taking buprenorphine two years, five months, and a couple of days ago. He counts each day. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine has been slow to catch on: It’s now prescribed about 10 million times a year, typically in a monthlong dose, a fraction of the 200 million–plus prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Partly that’s because the government says that doctors can’t prescribe it to more than 100 patients, and most are limited to 30 or fewer. Even those doctors must take a short course to receive a waiver allowing them to prescribe the drug. Along with many doctors staying away from treating addicts, the restrictions explain why only about 29,000 of the nation’s 916,000 doctors prescribe the drug. In contrast, there are about 320,000 U.S. prescribers of extended-dosage opioid painkillers with unlimited prescribing privileges, according to FDA. Surveys suggest that most of the doctors allowed to prescribe buprenorphine are not psychiatrists or addiction specialists, epidemiologist Hannah Knudsen of the University of Kentucky in Lexington told BuzzFeed News. Their numbers have grown by about 20% in the last two years, however, partly reflecting southern states catching up to northern states in the number of accredited doctors.\n\n\n\nWhere Doctors Prescribe Buprenorphine Hannah Knudsen / University of Kentucky / Via cartodb.com Number of doctors who have received a buprenorphine waiver, per 100,000 residents, as of December 2015.\n\nTraditional detoxification, where a patient is nursed through withdrawal and then returns home after about a month, is a lousy way to treat addiction. It leads to relapse about 90% of the time. But buprenorphine is not a miracle alternative. Of the 24 addicts, including Jernigan, who were in the study testing the drug with counseling, only 3 successfully quit, including him. Across many trials, buprenorphine leads to success in only one-quarter to one-third of addicts, according to FDA survey data presented last month at an advisory committee meeting. Plus, people do get high on buprenorphine. “If you make a drug more available, it will be abused,” R. Terry Furst of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told BuzzFeed News. His own interviews with addicts and dealers suggest that opioid addicts sometimes use buprenorphine as a way to tide their cravings over, until they next binge on heroin. Furst is also worried about recreational drug users who binge on the weekends — he calls them “weekend warriors” — who are finding their way to “bupes.” So he’s not happy about the new moves in Washington to make prescribing buprenorphine easier. Raising the limits on the number of patients who can receive prescriptions or letting nurses prescribe buprenorphine under a doctor’s supervision “is insane,” he said. Not everyone agrees. Addiction specialists such as Gail D’Onofrio of Yale say that restricting buprenorphine prescriptions could hinder full-fledged recovery centers that offer counseling as well as medication. “People need help with a job, with mental issues, with their family, with putting their life together again,” D’Onofrio told BuzzFeed News. Those kind of services cost money, and the doctor becomes a bottleneck on the number of addicts that quality recovery centers can treat.\n\nBrian Snyder / Reuters / Via pictures.reuters.com Suboxone pills\n\nLast month, an FDA scientific advisory committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of a new approach: a six-month implant of buprenorphine for addicts who are “stable” in their recovery from prescription painkiller addiction. Called Probuphine, and developed by Titan Pharmaceuticals of California and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, the implant buried in a patient’s upper arm will in theory deliver a six-month supply of the medication while limiting illicit sales. “It sounds like a reasonably good option for someone in recovery to ‘get it and forget it’ so they don’t have to remember their medication,” addiction treatment expert Marc LaRochelle of Boston Medical Center told BuzzFeed News. “I wouldn’t give it to everyone, but it would be nice to have another option.” The FDA had nixed the implant in 2013, overriding an earlier science panel vote for its approval, out of concern about a lack of safety data. FDA scientists again voiced concerns again at last month’s hearing, which largely debated a Braeburn-funded study finding the implant performed at least as well as the other approved forms of the drug in 176 addicts. Jernigan was one of the study volunteers, and he testified in favor of the implant at the Jan. 12 hearing, his travel paid for by Braeburn. “What the implant does is take away the reminder of how I screwed up every day, and the worry about missing my medication,” he said. “I don’t have to go to the pharmacy to get the look, ‘Oh you are one of those.’” At the same hearing, Braeburn representatives suggested that only 14% of the implant patients relapsed into illicit drug use during the trial, compared with 28% of daily pill users. About 25% of people now prescribed low doses of buprenorphine to treat addiction after about six months of recovery — or about 400,000 addicts — could benefit from implants, the company says. But the implant users ended up taking more medication overall than the daily drug users, pharmacologist Tracy Rupp of the National Center for Health Research testified, in a critique. That’s likely because it might take up to four weeks for the implant’s medication to kick in, she said, and the patients required extra medication until that happened. Doctors mishandling the transition from daily doses of buprenorphine to the implant might leave recovering addicts suddenly vulnerable to relapse. Furst also worries about addicts ripping the implants out of their arms to get high. “Never underestimate the ingenuity of someone addicted,” he said. But Braeburn representatives said at the hearing that little of the drug could be recovered from the implant that way. For Jernigan, an implant’s potential to remove him from the stigma of picking up his prescription counts as much as anything in its favor. “Everyone’s recovery is different, but this stuff saved my life,” Jernigan said to BuzzFeed News. “Not having to worry about forgetting it and reminding my wife of the problems I caused all the time would be wonderful.” “I feel sorry for all the people who didn’t make it,” he added. “I’ve worked hard, harder than I worked when I was young, the last few years. But it is also fun, clearing my mind finally. I can feel myself getting better.”']","Lots of solid reporting on an important topic in this story. The main problems with the piece are the primitive click-bait headline and a lack of hard data from published, peer-reviewed studies.","This substantially reported article mostly reviews and updates the politics, marketing and use of opioid medications–notably buprenorphine–in various forms and drug combinations–to treat opioid addiction. The piece is thoroughly researched, containing lots of anecdotes, comments and opinions, including from governors, other politicians, criminologists, a self-described addict, and physicians knowledgeable about addiction and treatment data. But our review team (which includes a primary care physician who educates other physicians on the clinical management of drug and alcohol problems) thought the story relied on relatively unsubstantiated, unpublished claims of safety and efficacy by a company that makes a buprenorphine implant and very little citation of actual published data or expert attribution of information. To its credit, the article hits most of the sticking points involved in the long history of opioid addiction, highlighting that regulations have promoted liberal prescribing of medications that lead to addiction and also inhibit doctors from prescribing medication to treat addiction. It reviews the lack of well-trained doctors, risks of, and restrictions on, prescription “bupes” and the rising prevalence of heroin addiction well beyond urban settings. But the piece could have benefited from stronger reliance on peer-reviewed studies, and much earlier mention of the limitations of the treatments described. And the headline, “Could This Opoid Implant Really End the Opiate Epidemic?” is catchy but overreaching. This primitive hook misleads the reader because the story is about efforts to improve the lives of people suffering with addiction, not waving a magic wand to end an epidemic.

A new blood test developed by researchers at Lund University in Sweden, Herlev Hospital, Knight Cancer Center and Immunovia AB, can detect pancreatic cancer in the very earliest stages of the disease. The results have been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nDue to diffuse symptoms, pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed very late in the disease progression. Therefore, despite pancreatic cancer representing less than 3% of all cancer cases, more people currently die from it than breast cancer. By 2030, pancreatic cancer is expected to be the second deadliest type of cancer in the world.\n\n""Our test can detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II, while there is still the possibility of successful surgical intervention. There is currently no cure and few treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer, which is the late stage when pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed"", explains Carl Borrebaeck, professor at the department of Immunotechnology at Lund University.\n\nThe study used samples from patients in both Denmark and the US, at different stages of the disease.\n\nThe blood test is developed on a so-called antibody microarray that consists of hundreds of recombinant antibody fragments. These antibody fragments are specific for a number of immune-regulatory proteins, cancer-associated antigens, and so on.\n\nSince the immune system is the first to respond to threats like complex diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and infections, the microarray was designed to mirror this early response. This provides information about the development of tumours long before being visible on CT or detected by ctDNA. From those hundreds of markers, 29 markers were selected to detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II.\n\nIn the future, the screening method could be used to screen people who are at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer, such as those with a hereditary risk, newly onset diabetes patients and patients with chronic inflammation of the pancreas.\n\nThe next step has already been initiated, which is a large US prospective study for high risk individuals.\n\n###']",Descriptions of the limitations of the research never found their way into this news release.,"The headline of this news release — ‘New blood test detects early stage pancreatic cancer’ — is misleading since the study results are quite preliminary, and the blood test was given to those already known to have cancer. For many readers the headline might suggest there’s a new screening test currently available that can detect this very lethal cancer in anyone, when that’s clearly not the case.
The strength of this news release is that it firmly establishes the need for early diagnosis in this difficult to diagnose condition.
Where it falls short is explaining what the main finding of detecting cancers with “96 accuracy” means, the significant limitations that place this impressive finding in a more appropriate context, and the potential influence of significant conflicts of interest among the authors.

The trial was funded by STEBA Biotech which holds the commercial license for the treatment.\n\nThe new treatment, \'vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy\' (VTP), involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumour tissue in the prostate. The research, published in The Lancet Oncology, found that around half (49%) of patients treated with VTP went into complete remission compared with 13.5% in the control group.\n\n""These results are excellent news for men with early localised prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,"" says lead investigator Professor Mark Emberton, Dean of UCL Medical Sciences and Consultant Urologist at UCLH. ""This is truly a huge leap forward for prostate cancer treatment, which has previously lagged decades behind other solid cancers such as breast cancer. In 1975 almost everyone with breast cancer was given a radical mastectomy, but since then treatments have steady improved and we now rarely need to remove the whole breast. In prostate cancer we are still commonly removing or irradiating the whole prostate, so the success of this new tissue-preserving treatment is welcome news indeed.""\n\nAt the moment, men with low-risk prostate cancer are put under \'active surveillance\' where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.\n\nRadical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and around one in five patients also suffer from incontinence. By contrast, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, and no significant side-effects remained after two years.\n\nIn the trial only 6% of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30% of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance. The chances of cancer progressing to a more dangerous stage were three times lower for patients on VTP, and the treatment doubled the average time to progression from 14 months to 28 months.\n\nThe trial involved 47 treatment sites from ten different European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.\n\n""The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable,"" says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. ""New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011.\n\n""We can now pinpoint prostate cancers using MRI scans and targeted biopsies, allowing a much more targeted approach to diagnosis and treatment. This means we could accurately identify men who would benefit from VTP and deliver treatment more precisely to the tumour. With such an approach we should be able to achieve a significantly higher remission rate than in the trial and send nearly all low-risk localised prostate cancers into remission. We also hope that VTP will be effective against other types of cancer - the treatment was developed for prostate cancer because of the urgent need for new therapies, but it should be translatable to other solid cancers including breast and liver cancer.""\n\nThe VTP therapy approach was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with STEBA Biotech, and the European phase I, II and III trials were all led by UCL. The drug used in the procedure, WST11, is derived from bacteria at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency. This property has been exploited to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.\n\nOne of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. He says:\n\n""When I was diagnosed with early prostate cancer, I had the option of active surveillance but I didn\'t want to wait until it got worse so when I was offered a place on the trial I signed up straight away. Some men prefer to delay treatment, but I couldn\'t live with the fear of the cancer spreading until it either couldn\'t be treated or needed a treatment that would stop me living a normal life.\n\n""The treatment I received on the trial changed my life. I\'m now cancer-free with no side-effects and don\'t have to worry about needing surgery in future. I feel so lucky to be in this position. I\'ve met other men who had surgery - they had to stay in hospital for days whereas I could go home the next day, and one suffered from terrible incontinence which he found very distressing. I had some minor side-effects for a few weeks after the operation, but I\'m back to normal now. I am incredibly grateful to Professor Mark Emberton and his team for the excellent care that I received, and I hope that other patients will be able to benefit from this treatment in future.""\n\nThe VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.\n\n###']","This release downplays harms, offers no discussion of study limitations, and hypes the findings with speculative quotes.","This news release reports the results of a phase 3 trial of a cancer treatment called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP), which involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumor tissue. Researchers in Europe randomized 413 men with low-risk prostate cancer, assigning half to VTP and half to the current standard of care, active surveillance, and tracked their progress over 24 months.
The news release reports quantified benefits and harms and mentions that the research was funded by a company that holds a commercial license for the therapy. However, it does not state the full extent of harms, offers no discussion of study limitations, and hypes the findings with speculative quotes, a faulty comparison with breast cancer treatment, and a patient anecdote that includes scary language.
This poorly done news release was also rehashed nearly verbatim by Reuters. We also reviewed that story, which earned one star.

He added that he views the new procedure as ""a clear simple alternative"" to standard migraine treatments.\n\n""This nasal spray option is safe, convenient and innovative,"" said Mandato.\n\nIn the new study, his team focused on 112 patients averaging about 45 years of age. All had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful (and cyclically occurring) headache known as cluster headaches.\n\nBefore participating in the study, patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10. Pre-treatment pain scores averaged more than 8, Mandato said.\n\nThe participants all underwent a session of ""image-guided therapy,"" in which a spaghetti-sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion. This was then repeated in the opposite nostril, according to the researchers.\n\nMandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe target nerve bundle, explained Mandato, ""resembles a complex highway crossing with many [nerve] signals and exits going in all directions."" And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle\'s headache-causing pathway.\n\nThe day after the procedure, average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4. Pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure, and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month post-procedure mark, according to the study.\n\nThe procedure didn\'t help everyone, though. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. However, 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated. Mandato said his team is continuing to monitor patients to see how well the nasal spray approach holds up six months out.\n\nDr. Richard Lipton, director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very dramatic.""\n\n""Unmet treatment needs in chronic migraine are huge, as is the overuse of medications,"" he noted. ""When a body gets used to having a chronic headache suppressor, the patient can experience a rebound in the absence of that suppressor. So developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable,"" Lipton explained.\n\n""These results sound very promising,"" Lipton added. ""Of course, it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time, and with a bigger group of patients.""\n\nMandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings Sunday at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Atlanta. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they\'ve been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe study received no funding from private industry.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on migraine treatment at the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.']","This story describes a small, ongoing study that touted lidocaine delivered to the back of the nasal cavity as an effective treatment for migraines. Although the story notes that the findings are preliminary, it does not inform us that the study wasn’t randomized or placebo-controlled; these are major drawbacks in interpreting the effectiveness of the procedure.","The story accurately quantifies the potential benefits of delivering lidocaine via a specialized procedure performed by an interventional radiologist, and it rightfully cautions against the limitations of a small, short-term study presented at a scientific meeting. But there’s no discussion of what it costs to thread a spaghetti-sized catheter into your sinuses each month to deliver the drug, nor is it clear how lidocaine compares with the slew of pain medications already out there for migraine sufferers. It’s great that the piece quotes an independent headache expert, who provides some useful context on the procedure, but one wishes he had delivered a bit more critical perspective on the research.

Here’s what the science says.,"['Dear Julia: How well do flu shots actually work?\n\nJust about every influential public health figure urges people to get their flu shots each fall as a necessary precaution during influenza season.\n\nSo over dinner, I asked a couple of respected evidence-based medicine researchers what they thought of the vaccine. I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.\n\nThis posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what\'s going on here. It\'s true that flu vaccines don\'t work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.\n\nWhy the flu vaccine isn\'t always effective\n\nThe flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.\n\nThe challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can\'t just make one kind of vaccine that\'ll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that\'s not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction — based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies — and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won\'t work that well.\n\nThis may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.\n\nIn kids, the highest-quality evidence — a randomized controlled trial — suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.\n\nIn adults, however, the vaccine\'s effects are more modest. ""Depending on the season,"" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, ""you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms."" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.\n\nJefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it\'s hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence suggests that there\'s no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.\n\nThat seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn\'t hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, ""Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.""\n\nOne key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don\'t. Because these aren\'t experiments — ideally we\'d have randomized controlled trials — they\'re more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.\n\nIn the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn\'t get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it\'s impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.\n\nAgain, though, this doesn\'t mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: ""Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.""\n\nWhy people still bother to get the shot\n\nDespite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.\n\nFor one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There\'s also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you\'re sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there\'s little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.\n\nAs Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, ""Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect."" He continued: ""However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.""\n\nWelcome to Dear Julia, a column where readers can submit everyday health questions.

Even individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the so-called “bad” cholesterol, but still at risk, seem to be identified, according to Mayo Clinic research being presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session.\n\nThe test, released commercially by Mayo Medical Laboratories in August 2016, measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides, a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart’s arteries.\n\n“Our research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,” says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study’s lead author.\n\nAccording to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.\n\nIn the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12).\n\nOver the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).\n\nIn patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.\n\n“There is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,” says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.\n\nThe trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.\n\nCo-authors are: Leslie Donato, Ph.D.; Sandra Bryant; Grant Spears; Peter Berger, M.D.; and Linnea Baudhuin, Ph.D., all of Mayo Clinic.\n\n###\n\nAbout Mayo Clinic\n\nMayo Clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice, education and research, providing expert, whole-person care to everyone who needs healing.

This release introduces a new contender, but it’s just one of many that haven’t been proven to make a difference.","The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions.
First, the release should have acknowledged that this test — even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke — may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn’t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven’t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes.
Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment.

As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.\n\nWomen were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.\n\nDuring the study period, 7,489 women died.\n\nDeath rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn’t, researchers report in JAMA.\n\nYounger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn’t.\n\nFor women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.\n\nAfter 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women’s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that the WHI didn’t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.\n\nStill, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women’s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTaking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.\n\nWith additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.\n\n“Hormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,” McNeil said. “The take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2jkqUFE and bit.ly/2jo0piX JAMA, online September 12, 2017.']",A discussion of the costs would have made it even stronger.,"This is a story about a study that follows-up on the long-term effects of hormone therapy on the risk of death.  The findings show that women who took combined hormone therapy (estrogen and progesterone) for approximately 5 years, or who took estrogen alone for 7 years, had the same risk of death 18 years later as those who had taken no hormone therapy.
Thus the small increases in risk of developing breast cancer and (mainly in older women) heart disease with combined hormone therapy did not translate into an increased risk of death.
The story does a good job describing the findings, and how the study was designed. The inclusion of an independent source also strengthened the reporting. A discussion of the costs would have made it even stronger.

These studies will be presented at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, taking place May 5-9 in New York, NY.\n\nData from a study in adults with treatment-resistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.\n\nData from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.\n\nIf approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.\n\n""With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,"" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.""\n\n""There\'s a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.""\n\nClick to Tweet: Janssen announces new Phase 3 data re. treatment-resistant #depression\n\nhttp://po.st/MUWq5V\n\nResults of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression\n\nIn the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients\' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).\n\nSecondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response ≥ 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score ≤12) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.\n\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.\n\nResults of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression\n\nJanssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint\n\nAlthough statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3\n\nSafety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.\n\nEsketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.\n\nThese findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen\'s treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.\n\nAbout the Studies\n\nIn both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 μl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.\n\nThe study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to ≥2 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively. Non-responders were randomized (1:1) to flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=114) or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=109). The primary efficacy endpoint – change from baseline to day 28 in MADRS total score – was assessed among patients who received ≥1 dose of (nasal spray and oral) study medication by mixed-effects model using repeated measures using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. (5.69). For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nThe study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study. Patients ≥ 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), with a weighted combination test to account for an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation, using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.\n\nAbout Esketamine\n\nEsketamine nasal spray is an investigational compound being studied by Janssen Research & Development, LLC as part of a global development program. Esketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It has a novel mechanism of action, meaning it works differently than currently available therapies for depression.\n\nEsketamine received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA in November 2013 for treatment-resistant depression and in August 2016 for the indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.4\n\nAbout Major Depressive Disorder\n\nMajor depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.5 Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.5 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.6\n\nAbout the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson\n\nAt the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are working to create a world without disease.

Both trials focused on patients who had not responded to at least two antidepressant drugs, and both trials used esketamine as a nasal spray, in conjunction with an oral antidepressant. One study focused specifically on patients over the age of 65.
The release provides a great deal of detail about the trial protocols and the specific differences in the depression scale that was used.  But the release, issued by a pharmaceutical company, does not address cost. And while the release does note that the trial in elderly adults produced no statistically significant results, it describes the results anyway. And while there may be promising results to report, the findings are reported in a way that makes it difficult to understand the advances — or even to tell the advances from the things that were inconclusive.

Dr. Nagele\'s work focuses on utilizing autoantibodies as blood-based biomarkers to accurately detect the presence of myriad diseases and pinpoint the stage to which a disease has progressed. By detecting Alzheimer\'s disease long before symptoms emerge, Dr. Nagele hopes those with disease-related autoantibody biomarkers will be encouraged to make beneficial lifestyle changes that may help to slow development of the disease.\n\n""There are significant benefits to early disease detection because we now know that many of the same conditions that lead to vascular disease are also significant risk factors for Alzheimer\'s. People found to have preclinical disease can take steps to improve their vascular health, including watching their diet, exercising and managing any weight and blood pressure issues to help stave off or slow disease progression,"" Nagele said.\n\nWhile the cause of Alzheimer\'s remains elusive, it is clear that maintaining a healthy blood-brain barrier is a critical preventative measure. Diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, stroke and being overweight jeopardize vascular health. As blood vessels in the brain weaken or become brittle with age, they begin to leak, which allows plasma components including brain-reactive autoantibodies into the brain. There, the autoantibodies can bind to neurons and accelerate the accumulation of beta amyloid deposits, a hallmark of Alzheimer\'s pathology.\n\nThe blood test developed by Dr. Nagele has also shown promise in detecting other diseases, including Parkinsons\'s, multiple sclerosis and breast cancer. His team\'s research on the role of autoantibodies explains that:\n\nAll humans possess thousands of autoantibodies in their blood;\n\nThese autoantibodies specifically bind to blood-borne cellular debris generated by organs and tissues all over the body;\n\nAn individual\'s autoantibody profile is strongly influenced by age, gender and the presence of specific diseases or injuries; and\n\nDiseases cause characteristic changes in autoantibody profiles that, when detected, can serve as biomarkers that reveal the presence of the disease.\n\nIn Alzheimer\'s, the brain begins to change years before symptoms emerge. Detecting Alzheimer\'s antibodies at the preclinical stage would give patients an opportunity to work with their physician to make lifestyle changes or receive available treatments before they become symptomatic. Potentially, this early intervention could help those with preclinical Alzheimer\'s avoid or delay the most devastating symptoms.\n\n""As osteopathic physicians, we constantly tell patients that a healthy lifestyle is the best medicine for preventing disease. We also know that many people tune out messages about nutrition and exercise until a health crisis gets their attention,"" said Jennifer Caudle, DO, assistant professor of family medicine at Rowan University. ""I can\'t think of a single patient who wouldn\'t take steps to prevent the progression of Alzheimer\'s if they could directly affect their prognosis.""\n\nToday, there is no definitive FDA-approved blood test for Alzheimer\'s, which affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans. It is among the top 10 causes of death in America.\n\nDr. Nagele\'s research has been supported by grants from the Michael J. Fox Foundation and the Osteopathic Heritage Foundation.\n\n###\n\nAbout OMED 15\n\nOMED 15 is a five-day event offering clinical and research updates in 15 specialties, with an emphasis on osteopathic principles and practices.']",This news release says researchers are closing in – “nearing development” – of a blood test “that can accurately detect the presence of Alzheimer’s disease.” But not a shred of data or evidence is provided to back up any of those claims.,"Those who communicate research results about devastating diseases such as Alzheimer’s should be prepared to present data to help readers assess the scope of the advances that are announced.  This news release failed to deliver any such data.  Worse, it catapulted beyond Alzheimer’s to say that the blood test being researched had shown promise in Parkinson’s, MS and breast cancer – without anything to back that up.

REUTERS/Andrew Biraj\n\nExperts described the study results as phenomenal and said the device, developed by German researchers, could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nThe device — known as a sub-retinal implant — sits underneath the retina and works by directly replacing light receptors that are lost as a result of the disease.\n\nAfter the light detection stage, it uses the eye’s natural image-processing functions to produce a stable visual image.\n\nEberhart Zrenner, chairman of the University of Tuebingen Eye Hospital in Germany and director of a small company called Retinal Implant AG which is developing the device, said the trial results were a “proof of concept” and would now be taken into further trials in around 25 to 50 patients in Europe.\n\n“We have shown that people can be provided with enough useful vision for daily life,” he said in a telephone interview.\n\nAccording to the study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, one blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently.\n\nHe could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.\n\nThe implant device, which sits completely within the eye, is a tiny plate, measuring just 3 mm squared and a 10th of a millimeter thick, which has around 1,500 tiny light sensors connected to amplifiers and electrodes.\n\nOther types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.\n\nRobert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain’s Oxford University and a consultant retinal surgeon at the Oxford Eye Hospital, who was not involved in this trial, said he was “very excited” by Zrenner’s results.\n\n“It proves the concept that in a patient who has been blind for many years and is unable to see anything, the optic nerves can be re-awakened for them to be able to see again. It’s of phenomenal significance in that regard,” he told Reuters.\n\n“To go from being completely blind for many years, to being able to read a few letters and see shapes is an amazing step.”\n\nRetinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.\n\nZrenner said further trials of the implant should be completed in two to three years and if those proved successful the device could be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years’ time.\n\nHe was cautious about possible wider applications, but said that if it was developed further, the device may someday be used to help people with severe cases of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older people.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is an example of almost indefensible hype.

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 15 million adults—approximately 6.7 percent of the population—suffer from major depressive disorder, which is most often treated through a combination of talk therapy and medication. Those who struggle with depression have imbalanced levels of serotonin, which maintains mood, and dopamine, which controls the pleasure and reward zones. The brain’s synapses control how much of these chemicals are released, and drugs like Zoloft effectively prevent the little serotonin being produced from reabsorbing back into the nerve cells from which they were released, resulting in a higher concentration of serotonin. Some pill-averse patients have longed for a natural cure for depression, while others complain that the drugs they’re on aren’t enough. Hope for both groups may have arrived through an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers discovered they can harness the power of magnetism to increase serotonin production and combat depression through a process called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).\n\n“Each [symptom of depression] maps onto a given circuit of the brain,” neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone told NPR in April 2016 about treating patients using TMS. “The reason why that circuit of the brain is not functioning properly...has to do with a deficit of a certain chemical in the brain. But the point is that if we can identify the circuit that causes the symptoms, we can target that circuit and make it function better through brain stimulation. So, in a sense, [TMS is] not a treatment...for the ultimate cause of the disorder, but it’s an intervention that improves how the patient is able to function.”\n\nPHILIPPE GARO/SCIENCE SOURCE\n\nTMS has a lot in common with a traditional MRI scan. In fact, the only clue TMS treatment contains magnets at all is that patients must remove any jewelry and stow their credit cards (to prevent demagnetization) before treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s description of the technique, a coil is fitted to the front of a patient’s head so the electromagnetic pulses can target the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls emotion. A physician then tests the machine to see how much power is needed to affect the patient’s reflexes. Once the patient’s thumb involuntarily twitches, the current is strong enough to affect the patient’s brain activity. At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs.\n\nThe biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Though it was approved by the FDA in 2008, its use is federally restricted with exemptions only for those with severe depression, autism or Parkinson’s. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. Its efficacy varies from patient to patient and, like most prescriptions for depression, TMS has its own set of side-effects. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. Although one-third of patients have reported experiencing painful scalp sensations and facial twitching, these tend to fade after several treatments.\n\nDespite these setbacks, researchers are optimistic about TMS—and not just as a form of treatment for depression. Experiments treating Parkinson’s and autism, the other two conditions for which TMS is approved, have seen some success among neurologists. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.\n\nThis article was excerpted from Newsweek's Special Edition: Nature's Remedies—Heal Your Body. For more on the definitive guide to alternative methods of healing the mind, body and soul, pick up a copy today.""]","The story offers little in the way of systematic evidence for the technique’s efficacy, and includes several factual errors.","Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been around for more than a decade, but this story encourages the reader to see the procedure as new by offering virtually no historical context. Additionally, it offers little in the way of systematic evidence for the technique’s efficacy, and includes several factual errors.
Clearly, many physicians embrace TMS, but a 2007 overview article in Nature offers what remains a salient cautionary note: “Although there is good evidence that this technique can modify cortical activity, the rationale for its use in many of the conditions investigated so far is not clear.”

Most stents are made of metal. But Abbott\'s new device, called Absorb, is made from a plastic-like material called polylactide that is commonly used in surgical sutures. The Absorb scaffold—Abbott doesn\'t call it a stent—is designed to completely fade away in two years and to cease supporting arteries at six months.\n\nAbbott won European regulatory approval for Absorb this year, but the company plans only limited marketing there until it gathers more supporting medical evidence next year. The company doesn\'t expect to file an application seeking U.S. regulatory approval until 2015.\n\n""I think it\'s a pretty smart idea,"" said Nick Ruggiero, a cardiologist with the Jefferson Heart Institute in Philadelphia who has no financial connection to Abbott.\n\nAbbott must still convince doctors, used to inserting permanent stents, to consider a dissolvable alternative. But if Abbott delivers evidence to bolster the concept, it will have unique technology and a years-long lead on competitors.\n\nAbbott expects to charge more for the Absorb device than the permanent, medicated stents currently available, which cost around $1,500 to $2,000.\n\nThe global drug-coated stent market is worth about $4 billion. Abbott\'s top competitors include Boston Scientific Corp. and Medtronic Inc.\n\nClinical-study data have shown low rates of complications with Absorb, although it has been tested in a limited number of patients thus far. Abbott expects to release one-year data on 101 patients at a medical conference next month, and hopes to launch randomized trials this year.\n\nStents are inserted into arteries where they are expanded with balloons. Newer versions, including Absorb, use medication to slow tissue growth that could prompt additional procedures. Today\'s top-selling stents, including Abbott\'s market-leading Xience devices, are made of metal.\n\nArteries need only temporary support to relieve a plaque-based clog, Abbott says. But today\'s stents stick around for life, which raises challenges. Arteries with metal cages in them aren\'t flexible and don\'t expand during exercise, says Richard Rapoza, head of research and development for Abbot\'s Absorb program. Stents can also make future bypass surgery trickier, among other potential complications.\n\nAfter six months with a stent in place, ""you are just interfering with the healing process,"" Dr. Rapoza said.\n\nStill, it isn\'t clear if the Absorb device offers a worthwhile trade-off, said Renu Virmani, president and medical director at the CVPath Institute in Maryland, which researches heart disease. Doctors will have to work harder to pick the right device size and implant it carefully with Absorb, compared with metal stents, she says.\n\nThey are also thicker than Xience stents at a time companies are touting slender profiles that may leave less surface exposed to passing blood cells that can clot.\n\nAbsorb hasn\'t shown clot-related issues thus far. But its thickness may mean patients can\'t quickly get off anticlotting drugs that can carry bleeding risks and complicate care, doctors say.\n\nWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@dowjones.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">While this story earned four stars by an honest application of our 10 criteria, the three on which it was judged unsatisfactory are worth noting.  Read on. </span>", ,4,real

It has been shown in numerous studies and clinical trials to reduce mortality from such causes as cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nExperts believe the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits of the foods associated with the diet confer health benefits across a variety of diseases.\n\nIn a new analysis that pooled findings from 50 different studies involving a total of more than 500,000 patients, researchers led by Demosthenes B. Panagiotakos of Harakopio University, Athens, found the diet had beneficial effects against five components of a prediabetic condition called the metabolic syndrome. The analysis found that adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with a 31% reduction in risk of developing the syndrome.\n\nThe constellation of components of metabolic syndrome include waist circumference over 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women, abnormally high blood pressure and blood sugar, very low levels of HDL or good cholesterol and high levels of blood fats called triglycerides. Abnormalities in these risk factors are widespread among the growing numbers of people who are obese or overweight or have diabetes.\n\nHeart experts and public-health officials believe effective approaches to helping people shrink their waistlines and achieve normal blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels would help reduce the devastating toll of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe new study, published online Monday by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, is consistent with other findings of the protective benefit of the Mediterranean diet.\n\nElizabeth Jackson, a cardiologist at University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, said the study suggests that ""when people are able to make improvements through diet, they are preventing the need in the future to go on medication"" to control blood pressure and other risk factors. If doctors make more effort ""to counsel patients on what a general healthy-eating diet is like, we can get a lot of bang for the buck,"" she added.\n\nThere were some limitations to the findings. For one, the benefit against the metabolic syndrome was found mostly in studies conducted in Mediterranean countries, and not in countries outside of that region.\n\nDr. Jackson said different designs of the underlying studies and the duration of follow-up could have influenced the results. She said, for instance, that U.S. studies, including the big Nurses Health Study at Harvard Medical School, have demonstrated the benefits of the diet in a U.S. population.\n\nThe results also reflect changes in recent years in how cardiologists look at the effect of diet on heart risk. For years, heart experts were focused on low-fat diets, but ""we\'ve really shifted our focus to thinking about other components,"" Dr. Jackson said. Research into the Mediterranean diet reflects how dietary fiber can affect measures like triglycerides.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story focused more clearly on results from a newly published study than its <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3707"" target=""_blank"">CNN.com competition</a> – and got at the risk reduction picture more clearly.  The criticisms we made are easily addressed. </span>","For decades, health benefits that may be derived from consuming a ‘Mediterranean diet’ have been reported on.  This remains of general interest to readers.  This story reported the results of a recent meta-analysis which pooled the results from 50 studies to examine the effect on risk factors associated with increased risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.

And it can boost older people\'s strength and balance.\n\nThe sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities.\n\nCompared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate, but as it\'s an outdoor activity, golfers may be more at risk of skin cancer.\n\nGolf is sociable, and gets people outdoors, connecting with nature. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.\n\nWhile around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.\n\nAnd the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.\n\nThis can put people off, says the statement. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says.\n\nMore people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some \'me time\' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.\n\nAnd the sport can do its bit for sustainability by ""practices that prioritise diversity, healthy societies, connection with, and care of, the environment, environmental integrity and health and wellbeing,"" the statement suggests.\n\nAmong its raft of recommendations, the consensus statement says that:\n\nGolfers\n\nShould aim to play for 150 minutes/week, or do less, but couple golf with other physical activity, and walk the course rather than ride a golf cart\n\nDo warm-up/strengthening exercises to cut the risk of injury and use sun-cream and wear collared shirts/blouses to minimise the risk of skin cancer\n\nMake everyone feel welcome\n\nClubs/Industry should:\n\nBuild on existing initiatives to promote inclusivity and develop environments and price structures that will be attractive to everyone\n\nDevelop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play golf\n\nMake every effort to promote equality and diversity, and boost accessibility\n\nPromote sustainability through wildlife conservation and by restricting the use of water, energy, and pesticides\n\nProvide additional facilities at clubs, such as a gym, walking routes, crèches and improve the focus on health and safety, with the provision of healthy foods, defibrillators, and speed limiters on golf carts, for example\n\nPolicy makers should:\n\nPromote the benefits of regular physical activity, including golf, for people of all ages, genders, and income brackets\n\nPromote the specific health enhancing aspects of golf\n\nSupport diversity, equality, and sustainability\n\nWork with industry and national associations to boost take up of the sport, particularly in groups where physical activity levels are low\n\nWork with industry and regulatory bodies to get golf included in the Paralympics\n\n""These outputs, if widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,"" the consensus statement concludes.\n\n###']","There’s no data, no study, no evidence, no news.","This news release touting the health benefits of golf overreaches and employs unjustified language in summarizing the consensus statement of 25 experts who used questionnaires to agree upon “how best to maximize [golf’s] health benefits, promote [its] sustainability, and widen participation.”

The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink\'s inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.\n\nBut more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer\'s Association.\n\nNutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.\n\n""Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer\'s disease with a limited concern about side effects,"" Wurtman said.\n\nPrevious experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.\n\nFor the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer\'s patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.\n\nDuring the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer\'s patients.\n\nWhether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer\'s isn\'t known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. ""I don\'t think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we\'ll see,"" he said.\n\nThe report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease.\n\nThe drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nCholine is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.\n\nThese nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.\n\nNearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.\n\nTo show the drink\'s effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.\n\nSince EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.\n\nAn earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer\'s did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn\'t develop, Wurtman said.\n\nThere are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn\'t been established, company spokesman William Green said.\n\n""Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,"" Green said. ""No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed. It is probable that any introduction would take place first in Europe.""\n\nAn ongoing study will evaluate the product over two years. If it appears to have a positive effect, then it may be something that could benefit patients even before definitive symptoms of Alzheimer\'s appear, Wurtman said.\n\nThies, of the Alzheimer\'s Association, is very cautious about the benefits of Souvenaid.\n\n""Medical foods do not have a requirement for FDA premarket approval, but they do have a requirement for having a scientific foundation and some evidence of efficacy,"" he said. ""But they don\'t have the kind of data we would find for a medication.""\n\nThat makes it difficult to make a clear-cut statement about the value of the product, he said.\n\n""There isn\'t a clear diet that prevents you from getting Alzheimer\'s disease or improves your memory,"" Thies said.\n\nIn addition, medical foods for Alzheimer\'s most likely won\'t be covered by insurance, he said.\n\n""You are making a judgment without the protections you have when dealing with a medication,"" Thies said.

Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.\n\nConsider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn’t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.\n\n“I was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,” Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the “borderline” label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: “Oh God, no.” After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. “I’m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right ‘formula’ of meds.” While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn’t have a concrete diagnosis today.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\nResearch Into Biological Markers\n\nThe problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They’re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. “Diagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients’] experience, looking at patients’ answers both from what they say and how they say it,” says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.\n\nRachel Barrett/Gallery Stock\n\nWithout such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less “real” than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.\n\nDr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.\n\nBahn’s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable—with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.\n\nArmed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will “develop schizophrenia over the next two years.”\n\nBahn’s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder—many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.\n\nChallenging to Bring to Market\n\nDespite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren’t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. “The problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,” says Bahn. “As the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.” For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it’s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That’s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment—no matter what a biological test says.\n\nThose working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. “Psychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,” says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel—and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.\n\nBut, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. “I think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,” Orlando says. “People often need concrete, tangible facts, and that’s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization—they just don’t understand it.”']","Well written, well researched piece could have done more to explain the status of the evidence around biomarkers for mental health disorders.","This is a story looking at the possibilities for developing lab tests for mental illness diagnoses, primarily schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
The story covers a wide array of information, and that’s not a simple task given the topic. Synthesizing years of research can be tough, and we don’t envy the challenge.
However, the story needed a more thorough examination of the quality of the evidence for the various research studies that are mentioned, a better quantification of the benefits that are mentioned, some mention of the risks involved in widespread screening for mental disorders, and a sense of the costs that would be involved.

Specifically, long-term XARELTO® use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Results from the study, which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin, were recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nClick to Tweet: New two-year real-world data show Janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail NVAF patients #JAHA #RWE #AFib https://ctt.ac/z3t2a+\n\nAffecting nearly six million Americans, NVAF increases a person\'s risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokes.i,ii Frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes. People with NVAF are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without NVAF,iii and research has shown frail people with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non-frail people.iv,v,vi\n\n""There is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with NVAF in clinical practice, which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke,"" said Craig Coleman, PharmD, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut. ""These results show long-term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. They also give physicians important insights into a well-tolerated, effective approach to treat their frail patients with NVAF.""\n\nIn the study, researchers used U.S. Truven MarketScan claims data and identified frail patients with NVAF taking XARELTO®, apixaban, or dabigatran. Each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 1:1 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event, insurance disenrollment or end of follow-up occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.\n\nResearchers made the following two-year observations:\n\nXARELTO ® was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin.\n\nwas associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin. XARELTO ® had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32).\n\nhad similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32). Though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes, neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46-1.35 and HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.60-1.45).\n\nRates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.49-1.06) and dabigatran versus warfarin (HR=0.87; 95% CI=0.63-1.19).\n\n""This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of XARELTO® across a broad spectrum of patients with NVAF, which now includes the frail population,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Real-world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients\' cardiovascular diseases.""\n\n\n\nAbout the Frailty Study\n\nA total of 19,077 patients were identified using claims data from U.S. MarketScan databases from November 2011 to December 2016. These patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with XARELTO®, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant. They also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage, and were considered frail. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Claims-based Frailty Indicator scoring algorithm, which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data, including demographics, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive dysfunction.\n\nEach eligible XARELTO®, apixaban, and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 1:1 ratio, which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts. A total of 10,754 patients were included in the retrospective study, with 2,635 taking XARELTO®, 1,392 apixaban, 1,350 dabigatran, and 5,377 warfarin. This study was supported by Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.\n\nReal-world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice; however, they have limitations and cannot be used as stand-alone evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes.\n\nAbout Real-World XARELTO® Research\n\nXARELTO® is the most-studied oral Factor Xa inhibitor in the world today. More than 200,000 people have been evaluated in published real-world research since the approval of XARELTO® across all approved indications in the U.S. Post-marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients. There have been no head-to-head randomized trials directly comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.\n\nOne recent study, REVISIT-US, found XARELTO® is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice. These are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid, given their potential for irreversible harm.\n\nWHAT IS XARELTO®?\n\nXARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.\n\nXARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.\n\nXARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?\n\nFor people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:\n\nPeople with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.\n\nDo not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.\n\nIf you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\nXARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.\n\nYou may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:\n\nAspirin or aspirin-containing products\n\n\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n\n\nWarfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® )\n\n, Jantoven )\n\nAny medicine that contains heparin\n\n\n\nClopidogrel (Plavix ® )\n\n)\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n\n\nOther medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines.

Systemic embolism refers to a blood clot that causes blockage of blood flow. The 2,600-plus patients analyzed in the study all had non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). NVAF refers to irregular heart rhythm that is not caused by valvular heart disease.
The 2-year study looked at insurance claims data to analyze patient outcomes from different drugs. According to researchers, the study showed that the patients experienced fewer strokes and systemic embolism when treated with rivaroxaban (brand name Xarelto, manufactured by Janssen) compared to those taking warfarin or other anticoagulants (apixaban and dabigatran). The news release neglected to mention potential biases in this type of research, such as the lack of randomization among compared medications. Importantly, the scientific paper this release is based on compared three of the newer anti-coagulants to warfarin but did not compare them to each other, thus making it hard to determine if one truly was “better” than the others.

You\'d take a nice big sniff to breathe in the sweet but subtle floral scent. Upon walking into a public restroom, you\'d likely do just the opposite--abruptly limiting the flow of air through your nose. Now, researchers reporting in the Cell Press journal Current Biology on July 2 have found that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) don\'t make this natural adjustment like other people do. Autistic children go right on sniffing in the same way, no matter how pleasant or awful the scent.\n\nThe findings suggest that non-verbal tests related to smell might serve as useful early indicators of ASD, the researchers say.\n\n""The difference in sniffing pattern between the typically developing children and children with autism was simply overwhelming,"" says Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\nEarlier evidence had indicated that people with autism have impairments in ""internal action models,"" the brain templates we rely on to seamlessly coordinate our senses and actions. It wasn\'t clear if this impairment would show up in a test of the sniff response, however.\n\nTo find out, Sobel, along with Liron Rozenkrantz and their colleagues, presented 18 children with ASD and 18 normally developing children (17 boys and 1 girl in each group) with pleasant and unpleasant odors and measured their sniff responses. The average age of children in the study was 7. While typical children adjusted their sniffing within 305 milliseconds of smelling an odor, the researchers report, children on the autism spectrum showed no such response.\n\nThat difference in sniff response between the two groups of kids was enough to correctly classify them as children with or without a diagnosis of ASD 81% of the time. Moreover, the researchers report that increasingly aberrant sniffing was associated with increasingly severe autism symptoms, based on social but not motor impairments.\n\nThe findings suggest that a sniff test could be quite useful in the clinic, although the researchers emphasize that their test is in no way ready for that yet.\n\n""We can identify autism and its severity with meaningful accuracy within less than 10 minutes using a test that is completely non-verbal and entails no task to follow,"" Sobel says. ""This raises the hope that these findings could form the base for development of a diagnostic tool that can be applied very early on, such as in toddlers only a few months old. Such early diagnosis would allow for more effective intervention.""\n\nThe researchers now plan to test whether the sniff-response pattern they\'ve observed is specific to autism or whether it might show up also in people with other neurodevelopmental conditions. They also want to find out how early in life such a test might be used. But the most immediate question for Sobel is ""whether an olfactory impairment is at the heart of the social impairment in autism.""\n\n###\n\nCurrent Biology, Rozenkrantz et al.: ""A Mechanistic Link between Olfaction and Autism Spectrum Disorder"" http://dx. doi. org/ 10. 1016/ j. cub. 2015. 05. 048']","The overall message of this release is accurate, but a lack of contextual details contributed to a mediocre 2-star rating.","This news release describes a recent paper in the journal Current Biology which reports that children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not respond to unpleasant smells in the same way that other children do. Specifically, children with ASD were found not to vary their sniffing behavior regardless of whether they were presented with pleasant or unpleasant smells; whereas children without ASD would sniff less when presented with an unpleasant smell, for example. The release says that this test based on a smell — a nonverbal stimulus — could be used in very young children to diagnose the condition early, when it’s important to begin treatment. The release does a solid job of explaining this intriguing research and laying out the implications in broad terms — particularly that much additional research needs to be done before such a “sniff test” could be used in a clinical setting. The inclusion of a few more contextual details, as discussed below in the review, would have increased the value for readers as well as our star score rating for the release.

""We are very encouraged by the results and the implications for the millions suffering from this common, yet debilitating condition.""\n\nInterventional radiologists perform GAE for knee pain by inserting catheters through a pinhole-sized incision, blocking the very small arteries or capillaries within the lining of the knee, reducing the inflammation caused by osteoarthritis. As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.\n\nThis prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient\'s pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.\n\n""This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,"" said Bagla. ""The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks. But GAE provides another option for patients struggling with pain and may even allow patients to avoid the painful recovery of knee surgery and the need for the kind of opioid pain medications associated with the dangerous epidemic in the United States.""\n\nThis study builds on the growing international research around GAE and osteoarthritis. While preliminary data shows that the treatment does work and is feasible, it has only been used in a clinical trial setting. The study has completed enrollment of 20 patients and final results are expected in summer 2018. A second randomized controlled clinical trial began in February 2018 and will provide further data on what types of patients are the best candidates for this treatment and how it could move toward clinical practice.\n\n###\n\nAbstract 210: Geniculate Artery Embolization (GAE) for Osteoarthritis (OA)-related Knee Pain: Interim Results from a Multicenter US Trial.

(Oct. 29, 2015) - Rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is one of the most dramatic medical emergencies a person can face. It usually strikes without warning, killing approximately 50 percent of those who experience it before they reach a hospital. Of those who do get to a health facility alive, only about 50 percent survive. When diagnosed through screening, aortic aneurysms are carefully monitored for signs of enlargement, and surgical intervention often is needed to prevent rupture of the vessel. Now, University of Missouri researchers have found that patients who took cholesterol-lowering medications before endovascular surgery experienced fewer complications and better outcomes.\n\n""Although this condition usually occurs in men older than 50 with a family history of the disease, anyone can have an abdominal aortic aneurysm,"" said Todd Vogel, associate professor and chief of the Division of Vascular Surgery at the MU School of Medicine, and lead author of the study. ""Most patients with this disease are older and tend to have other health conditions such as high cholesterol. In an effort to prevent cardiovascular disease they take statin medications. These cholesterol-lowering medications protect blood vessels from plaque formation and stress, and in some cases can even slow the progression of aortic aneurysms. We wanted to understand the impact statin use has on surgical outcomes when repairing this type of aneurysm.""\n\nVogel\'s research team reviewed nearly 20,000 cases where patients either had open surgery or an endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to access the aneurysm. The team then identified patients who took cholesterol-lowering medication before surgery.\n\n""Our research showed that patients who took statins before either open or minimally invasive interventions had better outcomes compared to those who did not take statin medications,"" Vogel said. ""The patients who took statins and had endovascular repairs had a 26 percent decrease in mortality up to one year after surgery. Patients who took statins and had traditional open procedures also did better, but the difference was not nearly as significant as with endovascular repair. The bottom line is that patients who used statins were more likely to survive during and after an elective endovascular procedure.""\n\nAdditionally, the study showed that statin use also reduced post-surgical complications for patients with other health issues such as peripheral artery disease, a condition that causes arterial blockages of blood vessels in the limbs.\n\n""This information could be beneficial to patients who are about to have elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"" Vogel said. ""However, further research is needed to assess the benefits of using statins before surgical repair of other types of aneurysms.""\n\n###\n\nThe study, ""The Impact of Preoperative Statin Therapy on Open and Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Outcomes,"" recently was published in Vascular, the official publication of the International Society for Vascular Surgery.\n\nAbout the MU School of Medicine']",A scary opener followed by bold claims followed by just one number adds up to a very misleading release.,"A review of 200,000 cases of individuals who underwent aortic abdominal aneurysm repair using two different repair methods uncovered the fact that patients taking cholesterol-lowering medications fared better than those who did not. Unfortunately, almost none of the abundant data in the study published in the journal Vascular found its way into the news release. Instead of creating a nuanced picture of the impact statins may have on reducing deaths in people who undergo aortic aneurysm surgeries, the release uses scare tactics and overly broad language to make people think that statins will save them from an unexpected and grisly death.

Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges.\n\n“I think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,” Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. “She would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months … any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.”\n\nOakes didn’t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n\n“She was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,” Amy said. “But there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.”\n\nOppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior.\n\nFor Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling— and willing to try anything to control them.\n\n“Initially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,” she said. “We tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.”\n\nMedication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment.\n\n“There were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,” Amy said. “She couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.”\n\nMallory’s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014.\n\n“She wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school … in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,” Amy said.\n\nDesperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That’s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J.\n\n“We went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,” Amy said. “I thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.”\n\nThe specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory.\n\n“What thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,” Melillo told FoxNews.com. “And if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.”\n\nThe program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders.\n\n“If you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,” Melillo said. “The easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.”\n\nThe program also incorporates what Melillo calls “bionutritional” guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids.\n\nMallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014. She has since gone on to complete two more cycles of Brain Balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition.\n\n“She's playing on the basketball team now, she's involved in theatre -- things that she wasn't able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them,” Amy said. “I really felt very hopeless, before we found Brain Balance, so the fact that I just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing, and I think she can do anything she wants to do.”\n\nFor more information, visit BrainBalanceCenters.com.\n\n""]","Riding a single anecdote, this story could easily raise false hopes in parents of children with autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and other diagnoses. Single-source single-anecdote stories do not make good health care journalism.","No data or research results are presented as evidence to back up the family’s story of help for their daughter. This story mistakenly substitutes an anecdote for scientific proof and appears almost to promote the nationally franchised Brain Balance centers. Most news organizations would include more than one source for such a story, and some balancing arguments about other alternative treatments.

Temel, an oncologist and author of the paper. “We thought it made sense to start them at the time of diagnosis. And we were thrilled to see such a huge impact. It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren’t mutually exclusive.”\n\nDr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients’ suffering before death, called the study “amazing.”\n\n“The field was crying out for a randomized trial,” he added.\n\nAlthough the study could not determine why the patients lived longer, the authors and other experts had several theories: depression is known to shorten life, and patients whose pain is treated often sleep better, eat better and talk more with relatives. Also, hospitals are dangerous places for very sick people; they may get fatal blood infections, pneumonia or bedsores, or simply be overwhelmed by the powerful drugs and radiation attacking their cancer.\n\nSaying the study was “of critical importance,” Dr. R. Sean Morrison, president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, said it was the “first concrete evidence of what a lot of us have seen in our practices — when you control pain and other symptoms, people not only feel better, they live longer.”\n\nThere is sometimes tension between medical specialties, since surgeons and oncologists often view cancer as a battle, while palliative care specialists are seen as “giving up.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It includes the options any oncologist addresses: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and their side effects. But it also includes how much suffering a patient wishes to bear, effects on the family, and legal, insurance and religious issues. Teams focus on controlling pain, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath and other side effects; they also address patients’ worries and make sure they have help with making meals, dressing and bathing when not hospitalized.\n\nHospice care is intensive palliative care including home nursing, but insurers and Medicare usually cover it only if the patient abandons medical treatment and two doctors certify that death is less than six months away.\n\nDuring the debate over President Obama’s 2009 health care bill, provisions to have Medicare and insurers pay for optional consultations with doctors on palliative and hospice care led to rumors, spread by talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, that the bill empowered “death panels” that would “euthanize” elderly Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLegislators eventually removed the provisions. In practice, Medicare and private insurers do pay for some palliative care, said Dr. Gail Austin Cooney, a former president of the palliative medicine academy. “But it’s piecemeal,” she said. “The billing is complicated, and for many physicians that’s enough of a deterrent to not bother.”\n\nDr. Cooney herself had such care along with surgery and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in 2008.\n\n“I decided I wanted every drop of chemotherapy they could give me, and it was very painful, dumping the drugs directly into my belly,” she said. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and “energy work” for nausea and fatigue.\n\n“I’m rigid — I had my last chemo treatment on Christmas Eve because I wanted it on the day I was due for it,” she said. “But I couldn’t have completed the program without the psychosocial support.”\n\nPalliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. But the National Institutes of Health is under budget pressure, and the other major source of money for medical research, the pharmaceutical industry, has little incentive to study palliative care. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy.\n\n“Philanthropists tend to focus on curing cancer,” Dr. Temel said. “But we can’t ignore people who need end-of-life care.”""]",An important description of palliative care emphasizing shared decision-making.  Kudos to the NYT for framing it this way.,"Our reviewers were split on one distinctive feature of this story – the discussion of the health care reform bill brought Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin into the story. One reviewer thought that had an uncertain effect and that the space could have been better used to provide more practical information about costs, benefits, and the limitations of this particular study.   The other two reviewers felt it was an appropriate and laudable editorial decision – that because the field of palliative care has been haunted by the ""death panel"" rhetoric of last summer, bringing it to the forefront in this story confronts directly one of the issues that prevent people from accessing palliative care, even when it is available — concern about palliative care hastening death.
We appreciate that the Times’s foray into this issue added some nuance that was missing in other coverage. The Times coverage also is notable for offering the most accessible description of what palliative care actually means, including practical examples of the services and treatment provided to patients. The competing coverage often relied on jargon about ""psychosocial support"" and other vague terminology that will likely be meaningless to many readers.

Pasta consumption was defined as all dry domestic and imported pasta/noodle varieties made with only wheat and no egg.

That’s nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested.\n\n“We really need to pay attention to this,” said Dr. Elaine Urbina, director of preventive cardiology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and a member of the US. expert panel. “It’s reasonable to screen for something that’s common, dangerous and has a treatment that’s effective and safe.”\n\nDr. William Cooper, a pediatrics and preventive medicine professor at Vanderbilt University, called it “an innovative approach” that finds not just kids at risk but also parents while they’re still young enough to benefit from preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.\n\nStatins aren’t recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said.\n\n“We’re not talking about putting all these kids on statins,” she said.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. He and another author founded a company that makes a combination pill to prevent heart disease. The work was funded by the Medical Research Council, the British government’s health research agency. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nResearchers were testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that, untreated, raises the risk of a heart attack by age 40 tenfold.\n\nThey did a heel-stick blood test on 10,059 children ages 1 to 2 during routine immunization visits to check for high cholesterol and 48 gene mutations that can cause the disorder. If a child was found with the disorder, parents were tested.\n\nOne in 270 children had the gene mutations; others were identified through cholesterol levels alone.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.

In the US, cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.\n\n— Marilynn Marchione""]","The story’s framing takes the stance that finding a risk factor very early on in life leads to an overall benefit. That may well be prove to be true, but neither the story nor the study being reported on provide evidence of that.","
This is a story looking at a study that found familial hypercholesterolemia was more common than previously thought. This condition is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and heart attacks in adults under 40. As a result, researchers are proposing that more kids get screened, and possibly start treatment earlier, to reduce this risk.
One commentator noted:  “We really need to pay attention to this” and “It’s reasonable to screen for something that’s common, dangerous and has a treatment that’s effective and safe.” The corollary to this statement is that there is little direct evidence that treating children with medication to lower cholesterol reduces cardiac deaths, and there are plenty of unknowns, such as the costs of screening and labeling very young kids with a disease that may not cause any problems for a long time. The story should have done more to explore both sides of this issue.

REUTERS/Nikola Solic\n\nResearchers studying more than 33,000 Swedish women found that the more chocolate women said they ate, the lower their risk of stroke.\n\nThe results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate.\n\n“Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nWhile she believes chocolate has health benefits, she also warned that eating too much of it could be counterproductive.\n\n“Chocolate should be consumed in moderation as it is high in calories, fat, and sugar,” she said. “As dark chocolate contains more cocoa and less sugar than milk chocolate, consumption of dark chocolate would be more beneficial.”\n\nLarsson and her colleagues, whose findings appear in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, tapped into data from a mammography study that included self-reports of how much chocolate women ate in 1997. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 years.\n\nOver the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk.\n\nAmong those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. That figure was 7.8 per 1,000 among women who ate the least (less than 8.9 grams per week).\n\nScientists speculate that substances known as flavonoids, in particular so-called flavanols, may be responsible for chocolate’s apparent effects on health.\n\nAccording to Larsson, flavonoids have been shown to cut high blood pressure, a risk factor for stroke, and improve other blood factors linked to heart health. Whether that theoretical benefit translates into real-life benefits remains to be proven by rigorous studies, however.\n\nNearly 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, with about a sixth of them dying of it and many more left disabled. For those at high risk, doctors recommend blood pressure medicine, quitting smoking, exercising more and eating a healthier diet — but so far chocolate isn’t on the list.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qhsaZ0 Journal of the American College of Cardiology, October 10, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall, this was a far superior job of reporting on this study than the competing <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=4348"" target=""_blank"">WebMD coverage</a>.</span>","Starting with the headline, this story is careful to explain that the study observed fewer strokes in those who ate more chocolate; it doesn’t suggest that the chocolate prevented strokes.

It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.\n\nRusso says, ""One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.""\n\nWhitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, ""Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.""\n\nFurther, he says, ""We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.""\n\nFor the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.\n\nModerate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, ""We don\'t know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn\'t offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.""\n\nAmong a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, ""We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.""\n\nThe researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.\n\nWhitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, ""We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.""\n\nThe researchers conclude that ""these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy.""\n\n###']",The study relies on a secondary analysis which means it re-purposes earlier research data to retrospectively explore an alternate question distinct from the original research.,"This release summarizes a study that examined the impact of physical activity on a very narrow subgroup of women: those who have had 1-2 miscarriages and hope to become pregnant.
The findings suggest that vigorous activity in these women — and walking over 10 minutes at a time in those who were overweight — increases the chances for getting pregnant.
The news release clearly lays out most of the limitations of the study, the big one being its reliance on secondary analysis. While the release could have put more emphasis on the weaknesses of such evidence, we do note that the news release made it clear that the findings from this very small subgroup may not apply to all women hoping to conceive, and that more research is needed to explain why certain activities (but not all) improve the odds for conception.

Where’s the evidence?,"['Step inside the lounge at Evolved Science and you’ll find a cocktail menu unlike any you’ve ever seen.\n\nThe ritzy Manhattan medical office — which says it serves high-powered clients and celebrities — shakes and stirs up tailored IV infusions using a slurry of vitamins and amino acids. There’s a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for “improving alertness and mental acuity,” and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before.\n\nThe company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, “annihilate toxins,” and stave off headaches. “We put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally — there isn’t any robust evidence to back up their health claims.\n\n“Supplements don’t fix anything and they don’t prevent anything. It’s simple,” said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science\n\nVitamin IV infusions aren’t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They’re part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren’t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.\n\nThe infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers’ cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers’ cocktail — but it’s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.\n\nThe research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other — which was also missing a placebo group — involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms.\n\nSchwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe.\n\n“We’re doing it in a sterile environment, it’s administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,” she said. “The only difference is it’s kind of a beautiful environment.”\n\nCustomers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they’re hooked up to IVs in the “infusion lounge.”\n\n“It doesn’t look like a doctor’s office. It’s very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It’s a SoHo house kind of thing,” said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon.\n\nBut as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation?\n\n“There is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,” said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.\n\nStill, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc — an in-home vitamin infusion service — offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go.\n\nAnd despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions.\n\n“What drives the market is not the science,” said Miller. “In spite of that lack of evidence, there’s still a market for it.”']",This story helps squelch some of the hype around vitamin IV infusions by taking a look at the evidence for its use.,"This short story shines a bright light on a health fad in which nutritional vitamin supplements are delivered directly to people via an intravenous drip.
The story was well-sourced and took a critical look at a health fad that’s trending. We appreciated the story’s probing and use of the word “evidence” in the headline. The story glossed over the potential harms a bit, but was otherwise a solid piece.

The investigational prep is designed to be good-tasting, with no fasting and lower fluid requirements than standard preps. It consists of nutritionally balanced bars and beverages incorporating the standard purgative active ingredient, PEG 3350, which a patient consumes during the 24 hours prior to colonoscopy.\n\nResults from the randomized, single-blind study will be presented today at the American College of Gastroenterology 2016 Annual Scientific Meeting, being held in Las Vegas, NV, by principal investigator, Douglas K. Rex, M.D., Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\n""Approximately 40% of those who ought to have a colonoscopy avoid the procedure, and the top reason cited for their avoidance is the prep,"" said Dr. Rex. ""Results from this study show that this innovative investigational product performed as well as or better at colon cleansing than two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations. Moreover, the higher levels of patient satisfaction reported by those who used the lead ECP formulation in the trial suggest this new approach to colonoscopy prep may have a positive impact on patient willingness to undergo this potentially life-saving colorectal cancer screening procedure.""\n\nThe study tested six formulations of ECP, using different doses of the active ingredients integrated within different meal kit menus, randomized against two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved active comparators. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects with an endoscopic visibility rating of excellent or good based on the Aronchick scale. Secondary endpoints included segment-by-segment endoscopic visibility based on the Ottawa scale, as well as safety, tolerability and reports of patient experience. Fifty-one patients were treated with ECP and 14 with active comparators.\n\nIn the top three most effective formulations of ECP, 90.6% (29 of 32) of patients had a rating of excellent or good. With ColonaryConcepts\' lead formulation, 93.3% (14 of 15) of patients had a rating of excellent or good, with 40 of 45 colon segments rated as excellent or good on the Ottawa scale. For the comparator products, 85.7% (12 of 14) had a rating of excellent or good. There were no serious adverse events across any of the treatment groups. The proportion of patients reporting being satisfied or extremely satisfied with the experience of using the lead ECP formulation was nearly double that for those using the standard preps, 64.3% versus 33.3%.\n\n""We are very pleased with the efficacy and safety results of this study, which clearly support advancing this product to a Phase 3 trial,"" said Corey A. Siegel, M.D., M.S., a co-founder of ColonaryConcepts, and Director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Associate Professor of Medicine at The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.\n\n""The ECP approach allows patients to eat solid food bars and drink palatable low-volume beverages, a patient-friendly design that participants in the study clearly favored over conventional preps,"" comments Dr. Siegel. ""Patients participating in the study were nearly four times more likely to recommend ECP to their friends and family as compared to the standard colonoscopy prep.""\n\n""Colonoscopy is still recognized as the gold standard - the best way to catch this cancer at an early stage. The medical community has called for an increase in colorectal cancer screening overall, both through the recent recommendations of the Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel and the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable\'s call for 80% screening by 2018,"" said Joshua Korzenik, M.D., a co-founder of ColonaryConcepts, and Faculty Member at Harvard Medical School and the Director of the Brigham and Women\'s Hospital Crohn\'s and Colitis Center.

""This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later.""\n\nYounger adolescents in the study showed bigger improvements in their cholesterol and inflammation levels than the older teens. Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.\n\nNearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person\'s obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.\n\nThe findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children\'s Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.\n\n""If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,"" Raghuveer says. ""They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they\'re closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.""\n\nAmong 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center\'s clinical practices.\n\nThe teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person\'s weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.\n\nThe risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person\'s insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.\n\nThree years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.\n\nBefore surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants — 83 percent — had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.\n\n""One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,"" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System\'s Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. ""And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,"" Lenhard says. ""The results were impressive.""\n\nThe study\'s biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it\'s not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the ""odds are very good"" that they would, and Raghuveer ""would be cautiously optimistic"" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.\n\nThe population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.\n\n""Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,"" Lenhard says. ""The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.""\n\nAn estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.\n\n""This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,"" Raghuveer says. ""It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.""\n\nBefore undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.\n\n""Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,"" he adds.\n\nAll three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.\n\nGetting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.\n\n""However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,"" Raghuveer says. ""I\'d be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.""\n\nMichalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.\n\nIdeally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. ""A generational divide"" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.\n\n""The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?"" Raghuveer says. ""The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.""\n\nTara Haelle is the co-author of The Informed Parent: A Science-Based Resource for Your Child\'s First Four Years. She\'s on Twitter: @tarahaelle']","The story did a good job describing the study, the potential harms of the intervention, and limitations to the findings.","This story covers an observational study showing cardiovascular risk factors improved after three years for teens who underwent weight-loss surgery.

Also, it’s always a good idea to point out when surrogate markers are being used as stand-ins for heart health.

""The UroLift System has an excellent safety profile and provides men suffering from an enlarged prostate a beneficial first-line treatment alternative to drug therapy or more invasive surgery. Importantly, the UroLift System provides fast and meaningful relief from BPH symptoms, improving overall quality of life for our patients.""\n\nThe UroLift System\'s permanent implants, delivered during a minimally-invasive procedure, act like window curtain tie-backs to hold the lobes of an enlarged prostate open. Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.\n\nData from clinical trials showed that patients receiving UroLift implants reported rapid symptomatic improvement, improved urinary flow rates, and sustained sexual function. Patients also experienced a significant improvement in quality of life. Most common adverse events reported include hematuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, pelvic pain, and urge incontinence. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.\n\nThe Northwestern Medicine Urology Program ranks amongst the nation\'s most experienced and well respected, providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care, including state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment capabilities for men, women and adolescents.\n\nAbout BPH Treatment\n\nMore than 500 million aging men worldwide have an enlarged prostate. Medication is often the first line therapy but relief can be inadequate and temporary. Side effects of treatment can include sexual dysfunction, dizziness and headaches, prompting many patients to quit using the drugs. For these patients, the classic alternative is surgery that cuts or ablates prostate tissue to open the blocked urethra. While current surgical options, such as the \'gold standard\' surgery, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), can be very effective in relieving symptoms, they can also leave patients with permanent side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (dry orgasm).\n\nAbout UroLift\n\nThe UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Performed through the urethra, an urologist uses the UroLift System to push aside the obstructive prostate lobes and positions small, tailored permanent UroLift implants to hold the prostate lobes in the retracted position. This opens the urethra while leaving the prostate intact. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. The most common adverse events reported during the study included pain or burning with urination, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, urgent need to urinate, and the inability to control urine because of an urgent need to urinate. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.\n\nRead more about urology care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.\n\nSOURCE Northwestern Medicine\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://www.nm.org\n\n']","Short on details, long on promise for an alleged ‘breakthrough’ minimally invasive surgery for enlarged prostates.","This news release was remarkably short on details and long on promise about an apparently new method to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. Sadly this was a missed opportunity to educate readers about how the surgery was studied and how it compares to the other common methods to treat enlarged prostates — including competing minimally invasive approaches. Promotional language describing this procedure as a “breakthrough” and “first line option” isn’t backed up by evidence.

REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro\n\nIn a systematic review published by The Cochrane Library, British scientists found that while cutting salt consumption did appear to lead to slight reductions in blood pressure, that was not translated into lower death or heart disease risk.\n\nThe researchers said they suspected the trials conducted so far were not big enough to show any benefits to heart health, and called for large-scale studies to be carried out soon.\n\n“With governments setting ever lower targets for salt intake and food manufacturers working to remove it from their products, it’s really important that we do some large research trials to get a full understanding of the benefits and risks of reducing salt intake,” said Rod Taylor of Exeter University, who led the review.\n\nThe Cochrane review attracted sharp criticism from nutrition experts. Francesco Cappuccio, head of the World Health Organization’s collaborating center for nutrition at Warwick University, said it was “a surprisingly poor piece of work.”\n\n“This study does not change the priorities outlined worldwide for a population reduction in salt intake to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the greatest killers in the world,” he said in an emailed comment.\n\nSimon Capewell, a professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University, said the review was “disappointing and inconclusive” and did not change public health consensus that dietary salt raises blood pressure.\n\nMost experts are agreed that consuming too much salt is not good for you and that cutting salt intake can reduce hypertension in people with normal and high blood pressure.\n\nMany developed nations have government-sanctioned guidelines calling on people to cut their salt or sodium intake for the sake of their longer-term health. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists reducing salt intake among its top 10 “best buys” for reducing rates of chronic disease.\n\nIn Britain, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Guidance (NICE) has called for an acceleration of the reduction in salt in the general population from a maximum intake of 6 grams(g) a day for adults by 2015 to 3 g by 2025.\n\nU.S. guidelines recommend Americans consume less than 2.3 g of salt daily, or 1.5 g for certain people who are more at risk for high blood pressure or heart disease.\n\nWhile previous trials have found there is a blood pressure benefit from cutting salt, research has yet to show if that translates into better overall heart health in the wider population. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases — the leading causes of death worldwide.\n\nTaylor said he thought it did not find any evidence of big benefits because the numbers of people studied and the salt intake reductions were relatively small.\n\n“The people in the trials we analyzed only reduced their salt intake by a moderate amount, so the effect on blood pressure and heart disease was not large,” he said.\n\nFor this review, Taylor’s team found seven studies that together included 6,489 participants. This gave the researchers enough data to be able to start drawing conclusions, they said. But even so, the scientists think they would need to have data from at least 18,000 people before they could expect to identify any clear health benefits.\n\nElaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland University of Technology in Australia, said that putting a spotlight on single trials and generalizing dietary advice for a single nutrient such as salt was “not helpful.”\n\n“What is helpful is for the food industry to reformulate products to reduce sodium and increase the nutrient quality of foods by using real ingredients,” she said in an emailed comment.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/q09xF8 Cochrane Reviews, July 6, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Good context, good sourcing. Independent perspectives added a great deal to the story. </span>","This is a story about the information published in a recent Cochrane reviewing what has been shown to result from the reduction of dietary salt intake along with the opinions of several diverse thought leaders in the field about the review.  The review found that small reductions in salt intake by people with normal blood pressure, high blood pressure, or a diagnosis of heart failure reduced blood pressure but did not show a demonstrable difference in the risk of developing heart disease or dying prematurely.  The authors of the study indicated that the data available involved too few people and too small a reduction in salt intake to show heart health benefits. The guidelines mentioned and the experts in the field who were interviewed shared the point of view that excess salt was detrimental.

The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients’ willingness to try allergy shots.\n\nSublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.\n\nFor the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.\n\nThe trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.\n\nAcross the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as “modest.”\n\nIn an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is “highly effective in many, but not in all patients.” He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.\n\nDr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.\n\nIn an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nIn addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.\n\nLike allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.\n\nResearch so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year — and not included in the current analysis — found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.\n\nBut longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.\n\nThe ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.\n\nStill, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.\n\nThe most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/sep35n Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, online August 5, 2010.']","A balanced, cautious story that earns a four-star score – nothing to sneeze at.  But it wouldn’t have taken much to boost this to a more complete story and a top score.

Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.\n\nCBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.\n\nWhile studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.\n\nThe study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.\n\nReturning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.\n\nThe study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.\n\n“These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”']",If this kind of program really ,"This is a news story about new findings indicating long-term benefits of cognitive-behavioral therapy for postpartum depression.
We can’t find any evidence that the findings this news story is based upon have been published yet, which is problematic–readers who want to learn more are left to fend to themselves. It appears, instead, that the findings were presented at the UK’s Royal Economic Society Annual conference in April, and perhaps will be published soon. But it’s far from clear where this story is getting its information from beyond a media briefing.
Now for what we do know: In 2008, a large controlled trial showed that a relatively simple form of cognitive-behavioral therapy for mothers diagnosed with depression was effective compared to the control group. In 2015, researchers checked in with the mothers to see how their children were doing. Now, in 2017, it appears, they’ve followed up to see how the mothers are doing–and it appears they’re doing well, still benefiting from the intervention. However, the data on this aren’t out yet.

This genetic test could help,"['During a traumatic divorce, Ronni Shapiro of Westhampton Beach, N.Y., became severely depressed and suicidal. Psychiatrists put her on different antidepressants that only aggravated her situation.\n\n“Within three months, I was on 10 different medications,” Shapiro, 61, said. “It was horrible.”\n\nEventually, she learned about GeneSight, a new type of genetic testing by Myriad Genetics, meant to help avoid the painful trial-and-error process many depression patients endure in the search for the right medicine. After a simple cheek swab, her results showed that pretty much everything she had previously tried was in the “significant gene interaction” category, meaning that based on her genetic makeup, these medicines would adversely affect her or prove ineffective at normal doses.\n\nGuided by her results, her doctor thought that Wellbutrin would be a more promising option. And though the test is better at saying what won’t work than what will, her doctor’s decision proved the right one.\n\n“I can’t tell you that I am footloose and fancy-free,” Shapiro said. “I still suffer. But when I fall into those dark holes, there’s like a ladder that I can see to climb up, as opposed to feeling helpless.”\n\nAs many as two-thirds of people with depression aren’t helped by the first antidepressant they try, leaving many to spend months after they are diagnosed without real help.\n\n>> READ MORE: In despair from major depression, I turned to a last resort: Magnets\n\nIn May, Myriad Genetics released the first large-scale test of whether treatment guided by genetics (pharmacogenomics) would improve overall outcomes for patients with major depression. The study found that patients were 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the company’s GeneSight test. The test uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze 12 different genes to weigh their combined influence on patient response to more than 55 psychotropic drugs. The patient’s color-coded report would read: “Use as directed” in green, “moderate gene-drug interaction” in yellow, and “significant gene interaction” in red.\n\nNow, another company, Genomind in King of Prussia, is offering free education about its genetic test, Genecept Assay, at Sav-On pharmacies in two Philadelphia-area Acme Markets.\n\nSpecially trained pharmacists may decide to counsel patients about the Genecept test if they see a pattern of unsuccessful treatment with medicine for depression, anxiety, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nNo magic solution\n\nBut while genetic testing offers tools to better guide patients’ treatment, it cannot tell doctors exactly which medicines will work – or necessarily provide the key to enduring remission from depression.\n\nVincent Sparks of Mullica Hill has benefited from genetic testing, but his mental health issues have persisted. Having battled anxiety and depression most of his life, Sparks, 60, was happy to find a genetic test to help his psychiatrist better direct his treatment. After taking the Genecept test, he discovered that a combination of Prozac and Lamictal was a better genetic fit for him than previous medications. But Sparks continues to struggle.\n\n“I have times where I’m fairly level for a while, but at times it seems like I’m on a roller coaster,” Sparks said. “Sometimes I wish I could just take out my brain and wash it. If I could just put it through the rinse cycle, things would be better.”\n\nThough imperfect, the Genecept test has been shown in peer-reviewed published studies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall medical costs. “In medicine in general, this will be standard of care at some point,” said Dan Dowd, Genomind vice president. “Twenty years from now, everyone will have some kind of pharmacological genetic test as part of their health record.”\n\nGeneSight’s test is covered by Medicare for patients under the care of psychiatrists and who have failed to achieve satisfactory results with at least one antidepressant. The company has coverage with some commercial payers and is working to widen that coverage, said Myriad Genetics spokesman Ron Rogers. The Genomind Genecept Assay is covered by Medicare and Medicaid. If the out-of-pocket cost for people with commercial plans is more than $300, Genomind will contact the client before processing the test. The company also has a financial assistance program for uninsured patients.\n\n“This is the beginning of personalized precision treatment,” said John Greden of the University of Michigan, primary investigator of the GeneSight study. “One-size treatment will never fit all, and we’re finally getting the tools, not just to say that but to act on it.”\n\n‘Knowledge is a good thing’\n\nMichael Thase, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and director of Penn’s Mood and Anxiety program, was another author of the GeneSight study. He stressed that although the test does not tell you exactly what will work, it can indicate a host of medications that will be ineffective.\n\n“I think knowledge is a good thing, and having knowledge in improving the care of your patient is a good thing,” Thase said.\n\nJohn O’Reardon, a Voorhees psychiatrist who treats patients with treatment-resistant depression and employs a form of neuromodulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), said that based on the results of the GeneSight study, he may start using this genetic test in his practice.\n\n“The absolute numbers for response [26 percent] and remission [15.3 percent] don’t seem that high, but unfortunately that is what you get with increasing treatment resistance,” O’Reardon said about the GeneSight study. He was more impressed with the results patients experienced a half- year out. “By six months, the response rate was up to 50 percent and the remission rate was about 40 percent, which are excellent results,” he said.\n\nFor Marina Goldman, a Jenkintown psychiatrist in private practice, the GeneSight study was “interesting but really beside the point.”\n\nGenerally, she thinks that TMS and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with their high success rates – approximately 75 percent to 83 percent for ECT and approximately 65 percent for TMS – offer more effective solutions for patients who have failed to respond to three or more antidepressants. At the same time, Goldman presents genetic testing as an option to patients with treatment-resistant depression who are wary about trying TMS or ECT.\n\n“There’s a big debate right now in the psychiatric literature, and what they’re writing editorials about is that we’re waiting too long to refer patients out for neuromodulation,” Goldman said. “With the genetic testing, the chance of getting a response is about 20 percent. Why not move to ECT, where the chance is about 50 percent for treatment-resistant patients?”']","The evidence cited here is still very preliminary, a finding we also noticed in another recently reviewed article on using genetic testing for targeting depression meds.","This Philadelphia Inquirer article looks at two companies’ direct-to-consumer genetic tests designed to help doctors rely less on trial-and-error, and more on genetic markers, in guiding their medication choices for patients who’ve proven difficult to treat for depression.
The article offers balance through two patient anecdotes. One patient says the genetic testing helped guide her to an effective antidepressant, while the other isn’t convinced. An outside expert is also tapped who points to specific treatments rather than genetic testing for higher chances of success.
Although this article was cautious about the touted benefits, it would have served readers better by exploring some of the limitations of the research studies. The evidence doesn’t appear to come from gold-standard, randomized controlled trials. The only study we found through an online search was an abstract presented at a May 2018 medical conference.

989,story_reviews_00196,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/vox-says-experimental-hiv-vaccine-is-promising-but-is-it/,2017-07-24 04:00:00,There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline,"['Developing a vaccine to stop HIV is thought to be among the most daunting challenges in medicine for one big reason: The virus is extraordinarily genetically diverse, even more so than the flu. So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.\n\nBut scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV’s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.\n\nResearchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what’s called the “Ad26-env mosaic vaccine.”\n\nThe mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It’s called a “mosaic” because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.\n\n“One of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,” said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”\n\nA word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.\n\nThe mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research\n\nIn the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that’s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)\n\nIn the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.\n\nBefore this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.\n\nWe need more human studies of this HIV vaccine\n\nBut we still don’t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don’t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.\n\n“I wouldn’t use the word excited too much,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.” It’s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.\n\nAs for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 — but there’s still a ton of work to be done\n\nWe’ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.\n\nResearchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.\n\nDeaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)\n\nAn HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV — too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.\n\n“A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,” Fauci said in a statement. “By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.”']",There’s far too much uncertainty in medicine to describe early results such as these as “promising.”,"This story about an experimental HIV vaccine gets off on the wrong foot by describing the research as “promising,” which we’ve previously flagged as one of 7 words that shouldn’t be used in medical news. Why not? As our publisher, Gary Schwitzer, wrote: “The word promising means ‘likely to be successful’ or ‘to give a basis for expecting.’ There is far too much uncertainty in medicine for this word to be applied loosely in the coverage of medicine.”
Despite this initial misstep, the story does quickly establish the preliminary nature of the research and cautions that it’s much too soon to know if the vaccine will ultimately be effective in preventing HIV infections. It also does a nice job of putting this research in context with other HIV prevention efforts that have succeeded in slowing the spread of the disease. More attention to the possible costs of a vaccine — a huge issue for the developing world countries most affected by the virus — would have rounded out this otherwise solid effort.

It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association\n\nThe new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes. As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.\n\nWhile the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication. The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended. Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.\n\nThe study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDoctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension. They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home. Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with “white-coat syndrome” -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor’s office.\n\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called “the silent killer” because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don’t know it.\n\nTo help understand the new hypertension guidelines and how they affect managing your health, see your healthcare professional.']","Any time medical experts spout the routine lifestyle advice, reporters should press them to explain what is really likely to change for people.","This story about new guidelines from the American Heart Association and other medical groups that reduce the threshold for diagnosis of high blood pressure summarizes the key recommendations, but doesn’t explain benefits, harms or costs.
This story (along with those from many other news media outlets) should have addressed the glaring disconnect between what is recommended and what doctors and patients actually do. The story used far lower estimates of the number of people likely to be told to start taking drugs than what was contained in an American Heart Association news release. (And the online and video versions of the ABC News stories used very different numbers.)
Readers of this story learn that they are more likely to be told they have high blood pressure, but not what that means to them, other than that they will probably hear more lectures about diet and exercise, and maybe get more drug prescriptions.

It includes a decade’s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.\n\nPeople who said they took daily aspirin - whether ‘baby’ or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.\n\nFor men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.\n\nThe effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn’t seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years.\n\nBecause the study wasn’t a clinical trial, it’s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.\n\nStill, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence.\n\nLONG-STANDING CONTROVERSY\n\nOther researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds.\n\n“This is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nEarlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good.\n\nOne of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient’s life - the idea behind colon cancer screening.\n\nSo far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug’s effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.\n\n“I don’t think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking” aspirin, Ray said.\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease.\n\nSOURCE: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, August 10, 2012.']",We appreciate the clear caveats about limitations starting in the second sentence of the story and continuing throughout – even discussing “detection bias.”,"The story was clear about what the new study suggests but what the limitations of the evidence are.  As a result, readers get a clear message – clearer than in the competing WebMD story.

Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries.\n\nAbout 40 percent of HCC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, a point when HCC is particularly difficult to treat. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit.\n\nThis study tested regorafenib\'s effectiveness as a second-line therapy on 573 patients previously treated with sorafenib, 194 of whom were given a placebo. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly improved overall survival, from 7.8 months on placebo to 10.6 months with regorafenib. Two patients treated with regorafenib had their tumor shrink to an undetectable level, according to the study.\n\n""This study represents a breakthrough in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, since it provides evidence for clinical benefits in an area that was an unmet medical need,"" said Josep M. Llovet, MD, founder and Director of the Liver Cancer Program and Professor of Medicine and Liver Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Regorafenib has shown it can improve survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma progressing on sorafenib. Previously, no treatment was available for these patients.""\n\nDr. Llovet was a member of the clinical trial\'s steering committee, and Charissa Chang, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Liver Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine, was principal investigator of the Mount Sinai testing site.\n\nThe success of this trial opens the field for testing drugs in third-line treatment of HCC and provides a rationale to test regorafenib as a first-line treatment or in combination with therapies administered directly into the tumor or diseased liver in patients in an earlier stage of HCC, according to Dr. Llovet. In this trial, regorafenib was well-tolerated with manageable adverse events, according to the paper in Lancet.\n\nIn January, Bayer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted priority review status for Stivarga (regorafenib) as a second-line systemic treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This research was also presented during the European Society of Medical Oncology\'s World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in June.\n\nLiver cancer is the second-leading primary cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.\n\n###']",The release would have benefited from clarification of the conflicts of interest and more attention to cost and harms associated with the use of regorafenib.,"The news release focuses on a phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated how effective the drug regorafenib was at treating patients who had a form of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and whose HCC had gotten worse despite taking sorafenib — which is currently the only available form of targeted drug therapy for treating HCC. The study, which was recently written up in The Lancet, found that regorafenib extended a patient’s life by just under three months, compared to the use of a placebo. The release addresses these findings in a straight-forward way, which is good. However, the release does not adequately address conflicts of interest related to the study, nor does it sufficiently address cost or potential harms associated with the use of regorafenib.

She woke up one morning with pins and needles in her hand, and within a week she couldn\'t move her left arm.\n\nBy 2001, five years later, she was living in the Ottawa Hospital under 24-hour care, getting around using a cane, walker, or wheelchair. When she was discharged on weekends, to spend time with her then-boyfriend Aaron, she had to rely on him for her every need. He\'d cut her food into bite-size pieces, and bathe and dress her. When she lost control of her bladder or bowel, he\'d help her go to the bathroom.\n\n""I had no feeling from the chest down,"" Molson says. ""I could touch something boiling on the stove and burn myself. I could touch fabric without knowing whether it\'s sandpaper."" For patients like Molson, with a severe form of MS and no response to the available medications, there’s little hope.\n\nTwo years later, her life had taken an abrupt turn. ""I walked down the aisle and danced at my wedding, something I had always dreamed of doing,"" she said of her marriage to Aaron in 2003.\n\nNow, 15 years later, Molson is still skiing and kayaking on the weekends. She works as a research assistant at Ottawa Hospital.\n\nWhat happened is something even esteemed medical specialists are venturing to call a ""miracle"": The particularly aggressive MS that was on track to disable Molson entirely — and potentially kill her — is now virtually eliminated from her body.\n\nThe game changer for Molson was an experimental chemotherapy and stem cell bone marrow transplant she got in 2002 as part of a study in Canada. Molson was one of a small cohort of 24 people with MS who received the high-risk therapy. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halted or reversed.\n\nTheir experience, documented in a paper published today in the Lancet, is the first to describe any MS treatment that fully stops the disease over the long term without MS medication.\n\n""Everyone is hesitating to use the \'c word,\' but these patients are cured,"" says Michael Rudnicki, director of the Regenerative Medicine Program and the Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, who was not involved with the research. ""Jennifer Molson was in a wheelchair in a rehab center unable to work. And now she\'s skiing, she\'s working, she got married, got her driver\'s license. I think this is going to be the new standard of care for progressive MS.""\n\n""My greatest hope was that the disease would stabilize""\n\nMS affects about 2.5 million people around the world, particularly women in more temperate climates like Canada and the northern US.\n\nInstead of protecting the body from foreign invaders, in patients with MS the immune system turns on its host, wreaking particular damage on the myelin, a protective coating around the nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nEventually these attacks can severely damage and destroy the nerves and myelin, interrupting the communication between the brain and body and leading to symptoms like numbness, trouble walking, and even blindness.\n\nBut not all patients\' symptoms manifest in the same way. People with ""relapsing remitting"" disease experience MS in fits and starts — their symptoms show up for a few days or weeks, followed by weeks, months, or even years of remission.\n\nFor most patients with this version of the disease, those periods of remission get smaller over time and eventually disappear, moving them into a new phase of disease known as ""secondary progressive MS.""\n\nOther patients experience something even more insidious and grinding. It\'s called ""primary progressive MS,"" and instead of bouts of remission they see a continuous increase in symptoms accompanied by a decline in health.\n\nMolson had secondary progressive MS at the time of her treatment in 2002. She had tried medication, and nothing worked.\n\nHer doctor, Mark Freedman (one of the authors on the Lancet paper), told her the stem cell transplant wasn\'t going to cure her, but at best, if the procedure went well, her health wouldn\'t worsen.\n\n""My greatest hope was that the disease would stabilize,"" Molson says. ""I looked at Aaron, [now] my husband, and said, \'If I don\'t do this, and it proves to work, I\'d be kicking myself if my disease progressed.\' It felt like I really didn\'t have a choice.""\n\nHow stem cells gave Molson a new immune system\n\nOnce she was accepted into the study, doctors began the procedure. They first put her through a short course of chemotherapy to stimulate the production of hematopoietic stem cells, which regenerate the immune system, in her blood. They then hooked her up to a machine that cycled through her blood 32 times over the course of seven hours, in order to collect stem cells. Those stem cells were then purified, wiped of any memory of the disease, to later be transplanted into Molson through a blood transfusion.\n\nThe most trying part of the treatment: Molson had to endure 10 days of chemotherapy. The doctors were essentially killing off her diseased immune system, only to later replace it with a new one in the form of her own purified stem cells. But the experience was grueling. Molson likened it to ""hell.""\n\n""I had a feeding tube because I was constantly nauseous,"" she says. ""I couldn\'t keep my food down.""\n\nGrowing a new, disease-free immune system meant Molson\'s body had to relearn how to defend itself from disease-causing bacteria and viruses. She had to get her childhood vaccines again. But she was also more vulnerable to infection, and wound up developing a blood infection, shingles, and serious bladder infections shortly after the transplant.\n\n""It took me at least a year before I started to feel human again,"" Molson says.\n\nAround a year and half after the transplant, she began to slowly return to some likeness of her pre-MS self: She was walking without using a cane, she could shop in the grocery store again, and eventually she didn\'t need to nap every afternoon.\n\n""I thought, Maybe I can go back to work,"" she says. By 2006, four years after her treatment, she returned to work full time. (She chose to work at the Ottawa Hospital, she said, after seeing firsthand how research can change people\'s lives.)\n\nMolson, now 41, says, ""I haven\'t had any MS symptoms in 14 years. And I\'m not on any MS medications."" That\'s a big deal given that the medications usually involve daily pills or frequent injections.\n\nBut treatment has also left her several unpleasant side effects. Because the chemotherapy damaged her ovaries and put her into early menopause, she\'s on hormone replacement therapy — and wouldn\'t be able to get pregnant. While she was given the chance to harvest her eggs, she declined. ""I couldn\'t look after myself, how could I raise children?,"" she says. ""Remember, I wasn\'t supposed to get better.""\n\nShe also has to be extra cautious about any exposure to infections. ""I was at the dentist three weeks ago, and I had to be on antibiotics before I went for a teeth cleaning,"" she says. ""There are still parts of the immune system that you have to be careful about.""\n\nMolson\'s hair never fully grew back, and she also contends with daily heartburn and digestive issues, which she takes medications for.\n\nOtherwise, Molson says she feels as good as she did when she was 21, before her diagnosis. ""I don\'t take anything for granted. I got a second chance at life.""\n\nOnly 5 percent of MS patients will be eligible for this new treatment\n\nThe study that gave Molson this chance was impressive in its scope and its execution — conducted at multiple hospitals by hematologists and neurologists in Canada and lasting nearly 20 years, from conception to publication. It built on decades of basic research about MS, stem cells, and the immune system, including years of experience using the treatment in patients with blood and bone marrow cancers like leukemia and lymphoma.\n\nOther scientists have already seen promising results in MS patients using similar treatment protocols, but none have managed what Atkins\'s team has: to completely halt the disease\'s attack on the brain —no relapses, no new MRI lesions in all surviving patients — and for such a long follow-up period.\n\nSeveral researchers who were not involved with the experiment — and who typically are reserved about novel treatments — told Vox they were excited and hopeful for the treatment\'s potential to benefit others with the disease.\n\n""I think this is going to be the new standard of care for progressive MS,"" said Rudnicki.\n\n""It’s exciting — an important proof of principle,"" said Jeffrey Gelfand, a neurologist specializing in MS at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nTim Caulfield, a University of Alberta professor who has been tracking stem cell research, noted the difference between this robust finding and the unfounded claims in stem cell clinics around the world: ""This is a fascinating development … [and] a good example of the difference between the real clinical research and what is being marketed by the clinics providing unproven therapies — you can\'t simply ‘inject’ stem cells and expect significant results.""\n\nStill, there are major caveats to consider. This study was small and lacked a comparison or control arm. Similar, larger studies are needed to confirm the results, and it\'s not clear what will happen to patients like Molson in the much longer term.\n\nOttawa Hospital hematologist Harry Atkins, the researcher who led the study, pointed out that only about 5 percent of MS patients would be eligible for this treatment: again, the minority who have an aggressive form of MS that\'s not responding to any treatment.\n\nAnd not everyone in the study had results like Molson\'s. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halt or reverse, but the other 30 percent continued to worsen.\n\nThat minority who didn’t respond, the researchers think, had MS that was already too far along by the time of their treatment. ""At early stages, once the immune system quiets down, the brain can partially heal itself, so the disability tends to get better,"" Atkins explained. ""But as time goes on, the brain can\'t repair itself.""\n\nOne patient died, which puts the potential for death from this procedure at around 4 percent, and severe infections after stem cell treatments — the kind Molson picked up, or worse — are also common.\n\nSince there are other MS medications that are much less toxic and can help some patients, doctors only recommend considering this therapy as a last resort. (Theoretically, the treatment could be done in most blood and marrow transplant centers associated with major hospitals, Atkins said, but there are only a few that perform the procedure. Interested patients can contact the MS Society for more information.)\n\nThere\'s also the cost: Atkins put it at about $50,000 to $65,000 per patient — and that\'s if nothing goes wrong. (Although, MS medications now cost about as much for patients every year in the US so this therapy could actually be a money saver.)\n\nAnd there are questions about the very long-term effects. It’s not clear what the next 10, 20, or 50 years look like for patients like Molson.\n\n""We know in the long term survivors from groups that have their transplants for cancer and they\'re cured and they live a long time,"" Atkins said, ""that they have a higher incidence of the general population of other diseases [such as heart disease and cancers].""\n\nAlready, Atkins and his team have been working on other applications for this stem cell procedure. They managed to reverse ""stiff-person syndrome"" — a rare neurological disease that causes the muscles in the body contract to the point of complete immobilization — in one patient. And there’s talk of applying the treatment to myasthenia gravis, another incurable autoimmune disease.\n\nCures in medicine are extremely rare. It\'s still too early to label this treatment a cure for MS. ""We have only followed our patients for up to 13 years,"" Atkins said, ""so it’s hard to say what the next 10 to 20 will bring. You’d want to know that before you\'d call this a cure.""\n\nFor now, though, Atkins will use the word miracle. ""It still appears like a miracle to me to see patients recover, and get back to the things that they were supposed to do in life,"" he said. ""It is very rewarding to see and it wasn\'t what we expected, and we are overjoyed about it to know this treatment can help people in that way.""\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article misstated the worldwide prevalence of MS.']","This is a well-reported story, covering many of the factual and contextual bases. The addition of infographics help readers visually understand the study findings, and a plethora of independent sources add credence to the claims.","One of the graphics used in the Vox story.
This lengthy story describes the results of a small, long-term, proof-of-principle trial of a “last-resort” risky but promising chemo-plus-stem cell transplant treatment designed for a limited sub-set of people with a severe, treatment-resistant form of multiple sclerosis (MS). 
This is a well-reported story, covering many of the factual and contextual bases. The addition of infographics help readers visually understand the study findings, and a plethora of independent sources add credence to the claims. 
There were three small things we’d have changed: The unfortunate headline (“doctors just reversed severe MS”), the questionably high prevalence data, and the use of a lengthy patient “miracle” narrative that overly delays mention of the treatment’s toxicities and limited availability. (Editor’s note: The prevalence data was corrected after we reviewed the story, but the original rating and comments stand. Corrections are valuable and we applaud any effort to increase the accuracy of news stories.)

""Now I feel relieved.""\n\nA study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects.\n\nThe findings are published in the Jan. 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nShingles is caused by the herpes zoster virus and only strikes people who have had chicken pox. It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.\n\n""Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,"" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nZostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.\n\nTseng\'s team wanted to test the vaccine\'s real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.\n\nIn vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.\n\nThe vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.\n\nThose who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.\n\n""People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,"" said Tseng.\n\nPatients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.\n\n""It does bolster our confidence that it\'s effective in the real world,"" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.\n\nBut the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.\n\nBecause shingles is not contagious and doesn\'t present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.\n\n""This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,"" Hirsch added.\n\nWhile less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.\n\n""I think it\'s a very good vaccine, and it\'s a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,"" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC\'s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nFor now, he advises getting it. ""It\'s protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,"" he said, ""so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it\'s recommended.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe CDC has more on the shingles vaccine.']",Best of three stories we reviewed on this study (see reviews of WebMD and Reuters stories as well). We invite your comparison.,"



This story about a study of how the shingles vaccine performs in regular clinical use does a nice job of putting the pros and cons of the vaccine in a larger context. We also applaud how this story addresses the potential harms of the vaccine. This story reports both the relative risk reduction (55 percent) and absolute risk reduction (from 13 to 6 cases per 1,000 people per year), but we wish it had told readers that 71 people would have to be vaccinated in order to prevent one shingles attack. We encourage broader use of this sort of statistic about the number of people you need to treat in order for at least one person to benefit. However, like the other stories, this one does not tackle the limitations inherent in this sort of observational study.

Both groups could do things to improve the detection rate, they said.\n\n“Several recent studies have raised questions on the effectiveness of colonoscopy as currently performed in everyday clinical practice on reducing risk of subsequent colon cancer,” lead researcher Dr. Harminder Singh, of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, in Canada, told Reuters Health by e-mail. “Therefore, it is important to study the factors associated with the diagnosis of colon cancer occurring after colonoscopy.”\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, a flexible camera is passed through the colon in search of abnormal growths known as polyps and other warning signs of early tumors. It is one of a few screening tests for colon cancer, the second-leading cancer killer in the U.S., according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnother less expensive test is fecal occult blood testing, which involves taking stool specimens at home and mailing them to the doctor’s office or medical lab. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best.\n\nIn their study, Singh and his colleagues identified nearly 5,000 individuals aged 50 to 80 who had been diagnosed with the cancer between 1992 and 2008, across the entire Canadian province of Manitoba.\n\nThe team found that about eight percent, or one in every 13 cancers, had been missed during colonoscopies conducted six months to three years prior to diagnosis.\n\nWomen were a third more likely to have had their cancer missed, report the researchers in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. And general practice physicians missed cancers 60 percent more often than gastroenterologists.\n\nThere are three likely reasons for these “misses,” noted Dr. David Lieberman of the Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland. Tumors may simply have gone unidentified on the exam, or were seen but not completely removed. While rare, he also noted that it is possible that an undetected cancer was actually not present at the exam, but rather grew very quickly afterwards.\n\nNo improvement in colonoscopy can do anything to avoid the latter. But the first two reasons are potentially avoidable, Lieberman told Reuters Health in an e-mail.\n\nGiven the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing.\n\n“There is an urgent need to focus on and improve the outcomes of colonoscopy,” Singh said.\n\nHowever, Lieberman cautioned against the over-interpretation of the results. “These patients were referred for colonoscopy, most commonly due to symptoms,” Lieberman said. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”\n\nColonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower.\n\nDr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.\n\n“The key to maximizing protection against colorectal cancer after colonoscopy is performance by an operator with excellent examination” and growth-removal technique, “in a well-prepped colon,” Kahi told Reuters Health by e-mail.\n\nAnd for this, patients should do their part. “To increase their chances of an early diagnosis, it is important that all individuals undergoing colonoscopy strictly follow the instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy,” added Singh, speaking of the large amounts of special drinks consumed before the test to clean out the bowel. “It may be a nuisance but it will help maximize the view during (colonoscopy).”\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/pec37p The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online September 28, 2010.']",A well-written and thoughtful piece about a large study on colonoscopies that generated some surprising findings about what clinicians have long thought to be a definitive test.,"The story puts the numbers right in the headline and follows up with more numbers in the lead. The story hits most of our marks and does an especially good job making use of independent voices.

Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.\n\nStudy points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer Read more\n\nEarly research – most of it still in the lab – published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.\n\nDr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: “During the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are ‘fed’ by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.\n\n“This is hugely significant. Testing the patient’s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”\n\nThe research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells’ growth by between 30% and 50%.\n\nThe scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.\n\nCholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.\n\nDelyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: “This is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments.\n\n“This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach.”\n\nAnother charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. “This early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,” said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist.\n\n“We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment. This discovery may, in future, help reduce these concerns for some patients, by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return, and tailor treatment accordingly.”']",More caveats were needed to temper puffery that the study is “hugely significant” and an “important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments.”,"This story springs from a recent lab study in the UK showing that breast cancer cells can use cholesterol molecules to mimic estrogen in order to grow, offering a potential reason why some breast cancers resist standard anti-hormone treatments.
The headline makes a quantum leap in logic in declaring that statin drugs used to lower cholesterol “could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment.” Similarly, the opening paragraph states that researchers “have raised the possibility of using statins” to stop breast cancer recurrence. That’s rampant speculation, not supported by the research being reported on, and the story should have clarified this.
Offering hope that a potential new discovery could curb recurrence makes for intriguing journalism, but if not framed correctly, it is a disservice to breast cancer survivors, especially with such nascent science.

The benefits may go beyond cardiac health,” Patel said in a telephone interview.\n\nFor the study, Gong Yang and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the National Cancer Institute looked at data from a large study of Chinese women called the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. They pulled out the records of 444 of the women, who had lung cancer.\n\nThe women had all filled out questionnaires that included details of what they normally ate. They did this twice – when they enrolled in the study, and two years later.\n\nOf the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. “Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factor,” they wrote.\n\nWomen who reported eating the least soy were 1.8 times as likely to die, on average. Those who ate the most were about 11 percent less likely to die.\n\n“This finding, along with our previous observation of an approximately 40 percent reduction in risk of incident lung cancer associated with high intake of soy food, provides further support for the role of soy food intake in lung cancer development and prognosis,” the researchers wrote.\n\nMost of the women in the study had never been smokers, and there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that lung cancer is a different disease in smokers versus non-smokers. “In Asian countries, 80 percent of women with lung cancer are never- smokers,” Patel said.\n\n“We don’t know if there is an inherited susceptibility to it,” she added. There might be an infectious disease that causes some cases of lung cancer —like the virus that causes cervical cancer, or the bacteria that causes stomach cancer.\n\n“Although the risks are probably different for American women for developing lung cancer, I do think it is a call to action for more research about how we develop lung cancer,” Patel said. “There are probably 30,000 people in the U.S. who never smoked and who have lung cancer.”\n\nLung cancer kills 160,000 Americans a year. It’s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It accounts for 27 percent of all cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nStudies suggest that people who eat the most soy have a lower risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Women may have fewer menopausal symptoms, and perhaps a lower risk of some cancers.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration says soy products may carry a heart-healthy label saying that soy may reduce cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nIt wouldn’t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. “The high soy level patients were eating what the FDA has said is heart-healthy, or 25 grams of soy a day,’ she said.\n\nStudies have shown that supplements containing soy protein don’t have much health benefit. But foods such as soy milk, tofu and edamame do. “We think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,” Patel said.\n\nSome researchers have wondered whether Western people who eat more soy food are benefiting from the soy itself, or because they perhaps use it as a substitute for meat and dairy foods. Patel says this study in China, where soy is a normal part of the diet and where dairy foods are less commonly eaten, suggests it’s the soy itself that adds the benefit.\n\nSoy and many other plant foods contain hormone-like substances called phytoestrogens. These may be affecting a cell compound called estrogen receptor beta, she said. That compound interacts with another one called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGRF, which is known to play a role in many cases on lung cancer.\n\n“Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death. There are many never-smokers with lung cancer,” she said. “People should consider eating a diet that is healthy. By all accounts one that includes soy decreases cardiac risks and could also affect lung cancer,” Patel concluded.\n\nHow can people add soy to their diets? A cup of vanilla soymilk poured over cereal provides 6 grams of soy protein, while an eight-ounce glass provides 8 grams. A soy burger delivers 10 grams of soy protein, while 3 ounces of tofu has 8.5 grams.\n\nRelated:\n\nSoy supplements don't help menopause\n\nSoy may keep breast cancer from coming back\n\nLung cancer on NBCNews""]",Another overly optimistic account of findings from an observational study.,"In this case, higher intake of soy foods was linked to better odds for survival after a lung cancer diagnosis in Chinese women. It’s potentially an important finding, but the story didn’t include the cautious language or discussion of limitations that we feel are mandatory when reporting on these kinds of studies. No attempt at critical analysis is made, and all findings are taken as truth.

The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.\n\n""In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,"" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.\n\nStable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60\n\nThe researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had ""massive, irreparable"" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder ""pseudoparalysis,""with little no ability to lift the arm.\n\nThis group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder ""ball and socket"" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nWhen first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.\n\nThe new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.\n\nCompared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).\n\nPatients\' ratings of ""subjective shoulder value"" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.\n\nHowever, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.\n\nWhen complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.\n\nThe results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA ""provides substantial and lasting improvement"" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.\n\n###\n\nClick here to read ""Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.""\n\nArticle DOI: 10.2106/JBJS.17.00095\n\nAbout The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery\n\nThe Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery (JBJS) has been the most valued source of information for orthopaedic surgeons and researchers for over 125 years and is the gold standard in peer-reviewed scientific information in the field.

Here's what the evidence says.","['Welcome to Dear Julia, a weekly column where readers can submit everyday health questions on anything from the science of hangovers to the mysteries of back pain. Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.\n\nHave a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.\n\nWhat\'s the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?\n\nI used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that\'s what we used in my house growing up. I didn\'t think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.\n\nSo I was surprised when I found out there\'s a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn\'t actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, ""I can\'t imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.""\n\nMoore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.\n\nLike all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: ""If you’re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.""\n\nNow, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.\n\nFor ongoing (or chronic) pain — a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age — ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.\n\n""WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN"" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn\'t seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, ""We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.""\n\nA limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds\'s Philip Conaghan explained, ""There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn\'t work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase — though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.""\n\nThe study also noted that patients on acetaminophen ""are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.""\n\nOther studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn\'t perform as well as ibuprofen, and it\'s linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)\n\nSo what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?\n\nIt turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls ""infrequent tension headaches"" and found ""it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us."" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.\n\n""Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,"" Moore said. ""Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it’s the go-to drug because it’s thought to be safe.""\n\nAnd that\'s where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn\'t actually that safe.\n\n""We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,"" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year — though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you\'re only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug\'s minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it.\n\n\n\n""Don\'t believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it’s safe,"" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they\'re taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days — particularly if they\'re on other drugs already.)\n\n""[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether""\n\nKay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany\'s Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: ""It\'s an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.""\n\nAspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses — which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. ""If you take one gram of aspirin,"" Brune explained, ""you\'re at risk of bleeding for another four days."" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.\n\nIbuprofen doesn\'t have these two problems — it\'s less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. ""Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage — so it\'s not free of risk,"" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke — one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other ""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.\n\n\n\nI asked Brune about what he\'d suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. ""Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won\'t cause measurable harm,"" he answered. ""Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it\'s also the most effective one.""\n\nIs acetaminophen good for anything?\n\nIf the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?\n\n\n\nYes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn\'t take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases.\n\n\n\nThere\'s also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.\n\n\n\nFever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.\n\nBut a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it\'s not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults.

The details may come as a surprise to those who think these pain relievers are interchangeable.,"In this installment of “Dear Julia,” Vox health reporter Julia Belluz takes on a reader question about pain medications. The reader wants to know which over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever is the best for treating pain – Tylenol, Advil or aspirin. The story presents evidence from high-quality studies and opinions from three pain experts. The story carefully explains that it’s not appropriate to state unequivocally that one beats the other because it’s not a one-size-fits all situation. In general, though, ibuprofen (name brand Advil) is more effective and safer than acetaminophen (Tylenol) and aspirin in beating minor pain.

""The effect was stronger in younger patients and in patients using more effective statins.""\n\nThe report was published online Sept. 7 in PLoS Medicine.\n\nFor the study, Chodick\'s team collected data on 1.8 million patients who got their health care through the Maccabi Healthcare Services, an HMO in Israel.\n\nThe researchers looked for connections between statin use and the development of both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that is unlikely to be affected by statins, the researchers noted.\n\nOver nine years of follow-up, 2,578 people developed rheumatoid arthritis and 17,878 developed osteoarthritis.\n\nWhen Chodick\'s group looked at statin use, they found that those not taking statins had a 51 percent higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis over about 80 percent of the follow-up period.\n\nAfter looking for other possibilities, those who took statins regularly had a 41 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis compared with people who were not taking statins regularly.\n\nAmong those taking statins, there was only a small, short-term reduction in risk of development of osteoarthritis.\n\n""Although the study does not have immediate clinical implications, our findings may suggest that patients who were prescribed statins and take it persistently may benefit from the many effects of statins, which go far beyond cholesterol reduction, including the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis risk,"" Chodick said.\n\nA previous study on the same group indicated that persistent use of statins was associated with substantially lower all-cause mortality, which could not be explained only by the prevention of cardiovascular disease, he said.\n\n""We believe that a major part of the improved survival among statin users comes from the anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated by lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, our previous study indicated that, despite their benefits, many patients on statins discontinue their treatment,"" Chodick said.\n\nThis work received no outside or corporate finding, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. Robert Myerburg, a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, stressed that ""this is a study looking for an association, and it doesn\'t prove that starting statins early in life will prevent or delay the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.""\n\nThe only way to prove the connection is with a clinical trial, Myerburg said.

This story about an association between long-term statin use and a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis covers many of the bases, but it doesn’t do as good a job as the other story we reviewed at giving readers a sense of the preliminary nature of the research. While we applaud stories that include specific numbers, this one probably left many readers scratching their heads about what the numbers meant. For example, the story reported that “those not taking statins had a 51 percent higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis over about 80 percent of the follow-up period.” Huh? Many of the numbers quoted are provided without context and as a result provide little in the way of information. Giving readers an easier statistic, such as ""number needed to treat"" would have cut through the confusion and provided important context to the true impact of the study. 
Like the other story we reviewed, this one fails to put the reported difference in rheumatoid arthritis rates in perspective. It reports the percentage reduction without telling readers the baseline risk for this population. Indeed, like the other story, it reports that among almost 2 million people included in the database analyzed by researchers just a couple of thousand people developed rheumatoid arthritis over the course of a decade. That is a rate of about one-tenth of one percent. While a “40 percent” reduction sounds big, it is impossible to tell from this story just how many people might be affected.

In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said.\n\nExperts said the findings, published online Feb. 16 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, are encouraging.\n\nOn average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what\'s been seen in studies of sleep medications and ""talk therapy,"" said study leader David Black, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to Black, that means older adults can feel comfortable opting for ""mind-body"" practices as a way to address moderate sleep problems. But he also emphasized the structured nature of the program tested in his study.\n\n""From our results, it is worth a try to engage in a structured mindfulness-based intervention led by a certified teacher with extensive experience,"" Black said.\n\nIn general, ""mindfulness"" practices encourage people to focus their attention on the present moment, instead of the past or future, and to take an objective look at their thoughts and emotions.\n\nSleep problems, Black explained, both affect and are affected by the mind. When people have difficulty sleeping, they often start to worry about it -- and that anxiety can worsen their sleep problems. On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological ""distress,"" such as depression symptoms, Black said.\n\n""There is a cyclical pattern here between wakefulness, sleep disruption, worry and mood,"" he said.\n\nBy learning ""non-judgmental mindful awareness,"" Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a ""necessary prerequisite"" for sleep, Black noted.\n\nFor the current study, his team recruited 49 older adults with ""moderate"" sleep problems, based on their answers to a standard sleep-quality questionnaire. It asked a range of questions -- including whether the person had problems falling asleep or staying asleep, had difficulty breathing at night, or felt drowsy during the day.\n\nBlack\'s team randomly assigned the participants to six weekly sessions of either sleep ""hygiene"" education or mindfulness training.\n\nThe mindfulness group learned different meditation techniques, as well as how to eat and move with more attention. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep.\n\nBy the end of the study, the mindfulness group was showing a significant improvement -- shaving about three points, on average, from their scores on the sleep-problem scale. The group that received standard education lowered their scores by an average of 1 point.\n\nThe mindfulness group also showed greater improvements in depression symptoms and daytime fatigue, the investigators found.\n\nBlack said the benefits of mindfulness training were on par with what\'s been found in studies of sleep medications and cognitive behavioral therapy -- a form of ""talk therapy"" that is often helpful for insomnia, for example.\n\n""Cognitive behavioral therapy is highly effective,"" said Adam Spira, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nThe problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it\'s available, the process takes some effort.\n\n""What I found most interesting about this [mindfulness] approach is that it\'s a non-drug option, and it\'s accessible to the community at large,"" said Spira, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\nClasses in meditation are available in many communities, and there are books, websites and CDs where people can learn mindfulness techniques. (The course Black\'s team studied is available online, at http://marc.ucla.edu.)\n\nThe caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program. There is no guarantee that the course at your local senior center or a book would have the same chances of working.\n\nStill, Spira said, it\'s a promising approach to older adults\' sleep problems -- and one that\'s needed. ""We definitely need a whole menu of treatment options,"" he said.\n\nOne major reason is that sleeping pills, the most common current treatment, are temporary fixes at best. Plus, Spira said, they can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people -- such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.\n\nThen there\'s the fact that sleep issues become common as people age, Spira said. Studies suggest that about half of adults age 55 and up have insomnia or some other sleep disturbance -- and that can have consequences for their physical and mental health.\n\nThere are still plenty of questions about the effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality. A key one is whether the benefits last.\n\nSpira said that with cognitive behavioral therapy, there is evidence that people\'s sleep keeps improving after their therapy sessions have ended. ""It\'ll be interesting to see whether people can learn mindfulness techniques, then see durable effects,"" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Sleep Foundation has more on sleep disorders.']","Our review offers a few suggestions for how this story could have been improved, but honestly, we couldn’t come up with much.","With a few dollar signs, this story could have been a perfect example of how to write about a small study with interesting findings.

Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.\n\nThis breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.\n\n\n\n“The ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,” says Professor Dunwoodie.\n\nThe landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby’s organs from developing correctly in the womb.\n\nNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.\n\nWorld first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.\n\n“Now, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,” Professor Dunwoodie revealed.\n\nAt the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.\n\nVitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.\n\nUsing a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.\n\nBefore vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother’s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.\n\nThis discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.\n\n“Just like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie’s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,” said Professor Graham.\n\n“We believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country’s greatest medical discoveries. It’s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It’s actually a double breakthrough,” said Professor Graham.\n\nThe next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.\n\nThe findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine – the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/\n\nThis study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\n\n\n1 in 4 pregnant women will suffer a miscarriage\n\n4.9 million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year\n\n3.3 million children under five die from serious birth defects annually\n\nCongenital heart disease is the most common form of birth defect, affecting 1 in 100 babies\n\n42 babies are born with a heart defect in Australia every week\n\n30 babies will undergo heart surgery in Australia every week\n\nHeart defects account for 30% of deaths in children under five\n\nREFERENCE\n\n[1] Baker H, DeAngelis B, Holland B, Gittens-Williams L, Barrett T Jr. Vitamin Profile of 563 Gravidas during Trimesters of Pregnancy.

The premise rests on the discovery that genetic mutations causing a deficiency in one type of molecule (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD) can lead to birth defects in humans. The researchers then tested the impact of vitamin B3 (or niacin) supplements on mouse models engineered to have the same mutations who were deficient in NAD. They found that the mice who had higher levels of niacin were less likely to have offspring with birth defects. 
The news release hid the fact that the vitamin supplements (referring only to “preclinical models”) were tested in mice, and not humans. But most worrying was the use of extremely sensationalist language prevalent throughout the release. The language was so overblown that it could give false hope to women without properly describing the limits of the research.

There are an estimated three million unplanned pregnancies a year in the U.S., often because of incorrect or inconsistent use of contraception, and about 1.2 million abortions, according to research cited with the study.\n\nThe Contraceptive Choice project is being run by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The study was funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, a charity of Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\nThe study found that long-acting contraception is about 20 times more effective at preventing pregnancy than pills, patches or vaginal rings because those methods ""wipe out the human error factor,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Peipert, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University. ""IUDs and implants are more effective because women can forget about them after clinicians put the devices in place.""\n\nFailure rates for such methods are less than 1% but they require an office procedure and can cost patients several hundred dollars if not paid for by insurance, doctors said.\n\nHormonal implants are inserted under the skin of the upper arm and are effective for three years. IUDs are inserted into the uterus and last five or 10 years, depending on the type. IUDs and implants can be removed if women want to try to become pregnant. Dr. Peipert said fertility returns immediately in most women.\n\nBirth control pills are the most commonly used contraceptive in the U.S., but women need to take the pills daily for them to be fully effective. Other studies have shown that many women—especially teenagers—miss two or more pills per menstrual cycle, which cuts the effectiveness at preventing pregnancy. The study also included a hormone-based shot that can be given to women every three months to prevent pregnancy.\n\nThe study showed pregnancy—or failure rates—among participants who used the pill, patch, or ring were 4.8%, 7.8% and 9.4% in years one, two and three of the study respectively, while the failure rates in those using IUDs or implants were all below 1% during the same period. Failure rates for women receiving the three-month hormone shot also were less than 1%.\n\nDr. Peipert said he hopes the results prompt more women and doctors who counsel women on birth control to consider IUDs and implants because it could greatly reduce unintended pregnancies. ""If there were a drug for cancer, heart disease or diabetes that was 20 times more effective we would recommend it first,"" he said.\n\nDr. Erika Banks, director of gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., said, ""For a woman who wants to get pregnant in a short period of time, it may not be worth the cost of having a long-acting method placed."" Dr. Banks, who wasn\'t involved in the study, added that some insurance plans will only cover pills, patches or vaginal rings.\n\nStill, she said, the long-acting methods can be an ""excellent"" option for young women who don\'t want to become pregnant for several years.\n\nDr. Peipert trains doctors on how to implant a contraceptive device made by Merck & Co. and Washington University receives fees from the company, according to the New England Journal of Medicine article.\n\nThe Contraceptive Choice study involves women who were between ages 14 and 45 who initially weren\'t using contraception or wanted to switch birth-control methods, from August 2007 through last September. The women also said they didn\'t want to become pregnant for the next 12 months.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com']","Overall, a good story, but women trying to make decisions would have been helped by a few more comparative details.","Many currently available birth control methods are effective, but only when they are actually used. A new study shows that methods such as the IUD and hormonal implants, which require no further attention once they are in place, are substantially more effective than methods that require daily attention, such as taking a pill.

Risk factors include genetics , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, swelling and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy — an alternative to surgery — entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. “You have some legal exposure by doing so,” said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater Phoenix .\n\nPhoto\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the “second most commonly used sclerosing agent” because, he said, “most physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.”\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were “wrong” and had “lots of contaminants” that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a Baltimore dermatologist who directs the Maryland Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera “is very safe for skin.”\n\nAn injector’s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, ulcers (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Using ultrasound to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. “The underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,” said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center . “Otherwise they’ll just come back.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are “very safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.” (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in Ocean City , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only “a little tiny pinch.” But she cautioned that if “anybody hates needles they will mind it.” Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have “very nasty veins” and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A “sudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,” said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was “very safe,” but that “it is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.” Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke “may have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.”\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients. Judson Emerick, an art history professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal. Plus, his “legs looked like a sack of walnuts,” he said.\n\nAfter a series of injections with Dr. Bunke, his ulcers have subsided and he is thrilled. “My wife looked at me, and my veins had disappeared,” said Mr. Emerick, 68. “My calves and definition were visible again.”""]",A woefully incomplete and imbalanced ,"This condition for the vast majority of people is a minor cosmetic annoyance that in no way affects their health, but the article suggests that everyone is potentially a candidate for expensive removal procedures based on trumped-up discussion of health risks. And while the story provides a fair amount of useful information about these treatments, it unjustifiably extols the benefits of newer treatments without comparing them to existing surgical techniques. It also relies too much on anecdote and didn’t seek out a perspective from someone with no financial interest in these procedures. Overall, a pretty poor showing from the Times. We expect and need better from the nation’s premier daily.

(March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer.\n\nThe higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they\'ve quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago.\n\nThe screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies.\n\n""Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,"" Schroeder said. ""If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent."" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease.\n\nThe pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening.\n\nLike the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal.\n\nSix of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant\'s primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year.\n\nParticipants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area\'s median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black.\n\n""It doesn\'t matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,"" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons.\n\nAugusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author.\n\nThe combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250.\n\nIn the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews.\n\nAnd while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found.\n\n""That\'s why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,"" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening.\n\nTo date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school\'s extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base.\n\n""We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,"" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said.\n\nThe original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late.\n\nFollowing the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there.\n\nA total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog.\n\nNinety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood.\n\nA 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks.\n\n###\n\nFor more information about free lung cancer screening at the Georgia Cancer Center and MCG, call 706-721-4726 or email lung@augusta.edu.']","<span class=""Abstract 154656078 0 1"" id=""scm6MainContent_rptSections_lblSection_3""><span class=""Paragraph 154656081 0 1"" id=""scm6MainContent_rptSections_lblSection_6"">Low-dose CT used in the screening program could have a high false-positive rate of more than 27 percent.

The screening initiative found that eight of 264 “high-risk” individuals — or 3 percent — had lung cancer.

1105,story_reviews_01181,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/3686/,2011-02-28 05:00:00,Gene therapy raises hope for a future AIDS cure,"['Gene therapy raises hope for a future AIDS cure\n\nBy MARILYNN MARCHIONE\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nMonday, February 28, 2011; 9:39 PM\n\n\n\n-- In a bold new approach ultimately aimed at trying to cure AIDS, scientists used genetic engineering in six patients to develop blood cells that are resistant to HIV, the virus that causes the disease.\n\nIt\'s far too early to know if this scientific first will prove to be a cure, or even a new treatment. The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe.\n\nThe concept was based on the astonishing case of an AIDS patient who seems to be cured after getting blood cells from a donor with natural immunity to HIV nearly four years ago in Berlin. Researchers are seeking a more practical way to achieve similar immunity using patients\' own blood cells.\n\nThe results announced Monday at a conference in Boston left experts cautiously excited.\n\n""For the first time, people are beginning to think about a cure"" as a real possibility, said Dr. John Zaia, head of the government panel that oversees gene therapy experiments. Even if the new approach doesn\'t get rid of HIV completely, it may repair patients\' immune systems enough that they can control the virus and not need AIDS medicines - ""what is called a functional cure,"" he said.\n\nCarl Dieffenbach, AIDS chief at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed.\n\n""We\'re hopeful that this is sufficient to give the level of immune reconstitution similar to what was seen with the patient from Germany,"" he said.\n\nThis is the first time researchers have permanently deleted a human gene and infused the altered cells back into patients. Other gene therapy attempts tried to add a gene or muffle the activity of one, and have not worked against HIV.\n\nThe virus can damage the immune system for years before people develop symptoms and are said to have AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The virus targets special immune system soldiers called T-cells. It usually enters these cells through a protein receptor, or ""docking station,"" called CCR5.\n\nSome people (about 1 percent of whites; fewer of minorities) lack both copies of the CCR5 gene and are naturally resistant to HIV. One such person donated blood stem cells in 2007 to an American man living in Berlin who had leukemia and HIV.\n\nThe cell transplant appears to have cured both problems, but finding such donors for everyone with HIV is impossible, and transplants are medically risky.\n\nSo scientists wondered: Could a patient\'s own cells be used to knock out the CCR5 gene and create resistance to HIV?\n\nA California biotechnology company, Sangamo (SANG-uh-moh) BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can cut DNA at precise locations and permanently ""edit out"" a gene.\n\nDr. Jacob Lalezari, director of Quest Clinical Research of San Francisco, led the first test of this with the company and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nHe warned that it would be ""way overstated"" to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure.\n\n""It\'s an overreach of the data. There are a lot of people out there with hopes and dreams around the C-word,"" so caution is needed.\n\nIn the study, six men with HIV had their blood filtered to remove a small percentage of their T-cells. The gene-snipping compound was added in the lab, and about one-fourth of the cells were successfully modified. The cells were mixed with growth factors to make them multiply and then infused back into the patients.\n\nThree men received about 2.5 billion modified cells. Three others received about 5 billion.\n\nThree months later, five men had three times the number of modified cells expected. As much as 6 percent of their total T-cells appear to be the new type - resistant to HIV, Lalezari said.\n\nThe sixth man also had modified cells, but fewer than expected. In all six patients, the anti-HIV cells were thriving nearly a year after infusion, even in tissues that can hide HIV when it can\'t be detected in blood.\n\n""The cells are engrafting - they\'re staying in the bloodstream, they\'re expanding over time,"" said Lalezari, who has no personal financial ties to Sangamo, the study\'s sponsor.\n\nThe only side effect was two days of flulike symptoms. It will take longer to determine safety, but several AIDS experts said they were encouraged so far.\n\n""It is a huge step"" and a first for the field of genetics, said John Rossi, a researcher at City of Hope in Duarte, Calif., where he and Zaia plan another study to test Sangamo\'s approach. ""The idea is if you take away cells the virus can infect, you can cure the disease.""\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Carl June, a gene therapy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, will report partial results from a second, federally funded study of 10 people testing Sangamo\'s product. He treated his first patient with it in July 2009.\n\nMany questions remain:\n\n- People born without the CCR5 gene are generally healthy, but will deleting it have unforeseen consequences?\n\n- Will HIV find another way into cells? Certain types of the virus can use a second protein receptor, though this is less common and usually when AIDS is advanced. Sangamo is testing a similar approach aimed at that protein, too.\n\n- How long will the modified cells last? Will more be needed every few years?\n\n- Could doctors just infuse Sangamo\'s product rather than removing cells and modifying them in the lab?\n\n- What might this cost?\n\nSangamo spokeswoman Liz Wolffe said it\'s too early in testing to guess, but it would be ""a premier-priced"" therapy - in the neighborhood of Dendreon Corp.\'s new prostate cancer immune therapy, Provenge - $93,000.\n\nYet AIDS drugs can cost $25,000 a year, so this could still be cost-effective, especially if it\'s a cure.\n\nJay Johnson, 50, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment there in September.\n\n""My results are excellent,"" he said. ""The overall goal is to not have to take medication, and then hopefully lead maybe to a cure.""\n\nMatt Sharp, 54, of suburban San Francisco, also had the treatment in September.\n\n""I would trade anything to not have to take a handful of medications every day for the rest of my life and suffer all the consequences and side effects,"" he said.\n\n""I may not live long enough to see the cure, but I always hoped for a chance.""\n\n---\n\nOnline:\n\nAIDS information:http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov\n\nandhttp://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/\n\n© 2011 The Associated Press']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Almost as important as the questions it answered were the unanswered questions the story listed at the end. Kudos for this kind of muted, responsible journalism. If only it hadn’t used the word “cure” 12 times. </span>","Our one criticism is for the headline writer, who had to frame it as “hope for a future AIDS cure” despite these caveats in the body of the story:
A competing MedPage Today story had this headline: “HIV-Resistant T Cells on Horizon.” That story said that the researchers “cautioned reporters not to use the word “cure” at this early stage.

1114,story_reviews_00709,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/researchers-in-italy-found-bergamot-lowered-blood-cholesterol/,1969-12-31 23:59:59,Researchers in Italy Found Bergamot Lowered Blood Cholesterol,"['The Ache: Common cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins can have unpleasant side effects, including muscle aches and weakness.\n\nThe Claim: An extract from a bitter, fragrant citrus fruit called bergamot, commonly known as a flavoring in Earl Grey tea, can lower cholesterol with minimal side effects, some scientists say. It also boosts good cholesterol, reduces fatty deposits in the liver and lowers blood sugar, they add.\n\nThe Verdict: Bergamot has been shown to lower cholesterol in at least four human studies published or presented at scientific meetings. But much of the work is authored by a group of Italian researchers who work closely with a company that sells the extract, scientists say. Larger, independent studies in other countries are needed to confirm the results, they say.\n\nBergamot fruit grows on sunny slopes in Southern Italy and are rich in substances called flavonoids, which likely are the reason for its beneficial effects says Arrigo Cicero, a scientist in the atherosclerosis and metabolic disease research unit of the University of Bologna. But he adds that he feels additional human studies are needed to prove efficacy.\n\nFlavonoids are antioxidants, or substances some scientists believe reduce chemical reactions in the body that damage cells. Earl Grey tea likely contains too little bergamot to have a therapeutic effect, scientists say, though the tea is high in another class of antioxidant called catechins.\n\nBergamot supplements, often in 500 milligram or 650 milligram capsules or tablets, are intended to be taken before meals. In human studies, a bergamot extract was shown effective at a dose of 500 milligrams to 1,500 milligrams a day, according to published results.\n\nIn a monthlong study of 77 patients published in 2013 in the International Journal of Cardiology, 1,000 milligrams daily of bergamot extract lowered cholesterol from an average of 278 milligrams per deciliter of blood to 191.\n\nBergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed. Photo: Reserveage Organics\n\nThe study also found that by adding bergamot researchers were able to reduce by half the dose of the cholesterol drug rosuvastatin without a reduction in efficacy, says study co-author Vincenzo Mollace, professor at the Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro, Italy. Dr. Mollace, a cardiologist, is a paid scientific consultant to Italy’s Herbal & Antioxidant Derivatives Srl, which sells the extract for use in dietary supplements.\n\n“The data looks very good,” says David Frid, a staff physician in the section of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. “But it would be beneficial for this to be reproduced [by another research group] in order to say that in fact this is a true cholesterol-lowering effect.”\n\nWhile Dr. Mollace’s study showed mild heartburn as the only side effect, larger long-term studies are needed to establish safety.\n\n“I would tell a patient the caveat is, ‘If you want to try it, you need to be aware that we don’t really know its side effects,’ ” says Dr. Frid. In addition, he adds, statins have been shown to improve health outcomes, such as reducing heart attacks, while bergamot hasn’t yet met that rigorous test.\n\nA glass of bergamot juice tastes like sour grapefruit, making capsules a palatable way to ingest a therapeutic dose, says Annie Eng, chief executive of HP Ingredients Inc., a Bradenton, Fla., company that sells its Bergamonte brand extract to about 30 U.S. dietary-supplement companies.\n\nSome brands combine bergamot with other ingredients. Bergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed.\n\nThe company hasn’t studied the combination, but it “logically it would make sense” that the two would work well together, says Rob Maru, the company’s chief innovation officer.\n\nThe amount of plant flavonoids in dietary supplements with bergamot will vary significantly depending on the fruit itself and how it is processed, scientists say. BergaMet Mega from Australia’s Nathealthsolutions Pty Ltd., is formulated to have the same potency of flavonoids as used in Dr. Mollace’s studies, says Chief Executive Selwyn Barr.\n\nDr. Mollace, who serves as an unpaid scientific advisor to Nathealthsolutions, confirmed that BergaMet has the same concentration of flavonoids as the extract he studied.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com']","Meeting most of our criteria for quality health journalism, this solid Wall Street Journal “Aches and Claims” column helps readers sort out research on a potential cholesterol-lowing supplement.","This story describes a potential cholesterol-lowering herbal supplement derived from the bitter citrus fruit, bergamot, found in Italy. It explains that four human studies have been published on the subject, and that all of these studies involved a cardiologist who is a paid scientific consultant to a company that sells the supplement extract. The story does a very nice job of describing the problem (that some people have muscle aches or side effects from statins), and that this extract appears to result in cholesterol reductions without those same side effects. The story could have done a better job explaining what the observed reductions in cholesterol might mean for someone’s overall cardiovascular risk, and describing the potential harms of taking unregulated supplements. That being said, the shortcomings of the supplement research are appropriately highlighted in a quote from a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist. He reminds us that we have data that statins improve health outcomes beyond simply lowering cholesterol, and that we do not have such evidence from bergamot studies.

And in other tests the app asks users to decide whether the letter ""E"" is facing up, down, right or left.\n\n“Your eye is sending your brain a blurry image, but because your brain has gone through this training, it’s capable of processing much lower quality images,” Starr said.\n\nThe company says the app is scientifically tested. In a small study published in Nature\'s Scientific Reports, 90 percent of participants gained the ability to read comfortably without glasses.\n\nBut not all experts are sold on the app’s training method.\n\n“The proposed theory of explanation behind the GlassesOff technology seems to imply that the resolution of the captured image of the eye and its more central processing by the brain can be improved upon, with ‘learning’. The idea that these low level changes can translate into higher visual performance that is clinically meaningful to a patient is yet to be demonstrated in any randomized clinical trial,” Dr. Barrett Katz, a neuro-opthamologist at New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, told FoxNews.com\n\nThe app is free to download, but the basic 3-month program costs $25. The company suggests following their “Ongoing Vision Care program” in order to keep the benefits indefinitely. For the life-long option, you can subscribe for $9.99 a month or pay $59.99 for the year.\n\nFor more information go to GlassesOff.com.']",This story improves upon other recent Fox News efforts by including an independent expert perspective — the lack of which we commented on in ,"This story is a rehash of a similar story that Fox News posted in January 2014. It’s also basically the same story that appeared in a Fox Business video segment in January 2015. Unlike previous versions, the new story thankfully doesn’t claim that the app may confer “super-vision.” But it adds very little to the previous coverage with the exception of a quote from an independent expert. With that one exception, the story reads like an advertisement for the app rather than a journalistic review. With so many other interesting and useful health care stories out there waiting to be investigated, Fox’s fascination with this lightly researched app is mysterious, to say the least.

In a new clinical trial, scientists show that a daily dose of probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium bacteria taken over a period of just 12 weeks is enough to yield a moderate but significant improvement in the score of elderly Alzheimer\'s patients on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, a standard measure of cognitive impairment.\n\nProbiotics are known to give partial protection against certain infectious diarrheas, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, eczema, allergies, colds, tooth decay, and periodontal disease. But scientists have long hypothesized that probiotics might also boost cognition, as there is continuous two-way communication between the intestinal microflora, the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain through the nervous system, the immune system, and hormones (along the so-called ""microbiota-gut-brain axis""). In mice, probiotics have indeed been shown to improve learning and memory, and reduce anxiety and depression- and OCD-like symptoms. But prior to the present study there was very limited evidence of any cognitive benefits in humans.\n\nHere, the researchers, from Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, and Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran, present results from a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial on a total of 52 women and men with Alzheimer\'s between 60 and 95 years of age. Half of the patients daily received 200 ml milk enriched with four probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. fermentum, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (approximately 400 billion bacteria per species), while the other half received untreated milk.\n\nAt the beginning and the end of the 12-week experimental period, the scientists took blood samples for biochemical analyses and tested the cognitive function of the subjects with the MMSE questionnaire, which includes tasks like giving the current date, counting backwards from 100 by sevens, naming objects, repeating a phrase, and copying a picture.\n\nOver the course of the study, the average score on the MMSE questionnaire significantly increased (from 8.7 to 10.6, out of a maximum of 30) in the group receiving probiotics, but not in the control group (from 8.5 to 8.0). Even though this increase is moderate, and all patients remained severely cognitively impaired, these results are important because they are the first to show that probiotics can improve human cognition. Future research, on more patients and over longer time-scales, is necessary to test if the beneficial effects of probiotics become stronger after longer treatment.\n\n""In a previous study, we showed that probiotic treatment improves the impaired spatial learning and memory in diabetic rats, but this is the first time that probiotic supplementation has been shown to benefit cognition in cognitively impaired humans,"" says Professor Mahmoud Salami from Kashan University, the senior author of the study.\n\nTreatment with probiotics also resulted in lower levels of triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of the Alzheimer patients, and likewise a reduction in two common measures (called ""Homeostatic Model Assessment"", HOMA-IR and HOMA-B) of insulin resistance and the activity of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\n\n""These findings indicate that change in the metabolic adjustments might be a mechanism by which probiotics affect Alzheimer\'s and possibly other neurological disorders,"" says Salami. ""We plan to look at these mechanisms in greater detail in our next study.""\n\nWalter Lukiw, Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Ophthalmology and Bollinger Professor of Alzheimer\'s disease at Louisiana State University, who reviewed the study but was not involved in the research, said: ""This early study is interesting and important because it provides evidence for gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome components playing a role in neurological function, and indicates that probiotics can in principle improve human cognition. This is in line with some of our recent studies which indicate that the GI tract microbiome in Alzheimer\'s is significantly altered in composition when compared to age-matched controls, and that both the GI tract and blood-brain barriersbecome significantly more leaky with aging, thus allowing GI tract microbial exudates (e.g. amyloids, lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins and small non-coding RNAs) to access Central Nervous System compartments.""\n\nThe study is published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience.\n\n###']",If  “all patients remained significantly cognitively impaired” after the intervention as the release suggests — where’s the clinical benefit for patients? The release doesn’t say.,"This news release describes the results of a randomized controlled trial that examined the effects of milk supplemented with probiotic bacteria on cognitive function and metabolic status (the whole range of biochemical processes that occur within the body) in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease.
Fifty-two men and women, aged 60-95 years, consumed either milk (the control group) or milk with a mixture of probiotics (the probiotic group) for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and metabolic endpoints were measured through blood samples. The news release presented an accurate description of the study design, provided conservative explanations of the improvements seen in the intervention group, and emphasized the need for more research. However, it did not discuss several important aspects — namely, the cost and availability of the probiotic milk, potential harms of probiotic supplements in certain populations, and alternative therapies for treatment of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Interpretation of the results was also inaccurate, leaving this news release with quite a bit of room for improvement.

The women were taking the medicine to treat high blood pressure or another heart problem, not as part of their cancer treatment.\n\nThe study was retrospective, and thus wasn’t randomized, and had other important limitations, researchers said. Further research, which is under way, is necessary to determine whether the findings could be translated into a new treatment for the disease.\n\n“It’s very interesting and very thought-provoking,” said Christina M. Annunziata, clinical director of the women’s malignancies branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Institutes of Health. “I don’t think it’s practice-changing quite yet.” Dr. Annunziata, who wasn’t involved in the study, co-authored an editorial accompanying the report, published in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society.\n\nMore than 21,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, the cancer society estimates. More than 14,000 will die from it, making it the fifth most deadly cancer among women. Recurrence rates are high and there have been few advances made beyond standard chemotherapy in some 30 years.\n\nExtra Time 47.8 months: Median survival for women taking any beta blocker, a common heart drug, during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer\n\nMedian survival for women taking any beta blocker, a common heart drug, during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer 42 months: Median survival for women not taking a beta blocker during chemotherapy\n\nMedian survival for women not taking a beta blocker during chemotherapy 94.9 months: Median survival for women taking a nonselective (first generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy\n\nMedian survival for women taking a nonselective (first generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy 38 months: Median survival for women taking a selective (second generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy Source: the journal Cancer\n\nDr. Annunziata and the study authors cautioned that beta blockers have side effects and more research is needed to see if the drugs’ benefits outweigh risks for cancer patients.\n\nIn recent years, studies have shown that chronic stress promotes the growth and spread of ovarian and other cancers. One way is by stimulating so-called fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline and norepinephrine, said Anil Sood, professor of gynecologic oncology and cancer biology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and senior author of the new report. Beta blockers can mitigate stress but previous studies that looked at their effect on ovarian cancer have been mixed.\n\nBeta blockers come in different versions. Mouse and test-tube studies have shown that so-called nonselective beta blockers inhibit molecular pathways that promote tumor growth. Selective versions, designed to minimize side effects for heart patients, are less effective in hitting such targets. Dr. Sood and his colleagues wondered if the same effect would be found in people.\n\nThe 1,425 patients in the study were treated at four different institutions between 2000 and 2010; 268 had been treated with beta blockers, including 75 given a nonselective version, while they were on chemotherapy. The researchers found that median survival for those treated with any blocker was 47.8 months, compared with 42 months for those not taking the medicines.\n\nBut difference between those taking a nonselective beta blocker—propranolol in essentially all cases—and those taking a selective version was much more dramatic: 94.9 months versus 38 months.\n\n“We would have predicted that there would be some difference but we were surprised to see the magnitude of difference that was coming up here,” Dr. Sood said.\n\nStill, it would “require prospective studies to feel really good that there is a significant benefit,” Dr. Sood said. The study didn’t show what dose might be effective or how long patients were on the drugs, for instance, or what biological markers might help predict which patients would benefit.\n\n“This is not something that people should rush out and start taking,” Dr. Annunziata said. “There are so many side effects of these drugs especially if you don’t have high blood pressure.” For instance, people with a history of asthma would be at risk for serious side effects with a nonselective beta blocker.\n\nSince essentially all beta blockers, including propranolol, are generic, drug companies aren’t likely to sponsor the large prospective study that would likely be necessary to determine any role beta blockers might have in cancer. Grants would be required, Dr. Sood said. But other research has suggested that stress may similarly affect colon, lung and prostate cancers.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']",This story provides some context that was missing from an MD Anderson news release about the same study.,"This Wall Street Journal article nicely summarizes the findings of a retrospective study of 1,400 cases of women with ovarian cancer; some of whom had been prescribed beta-blockers for high blood pressure and appeared to have better outcomes than those not taking beta-blockers. It hits on nearly all of our criteria, and was more thorough and balanced than an MD Anderson news release that initially announced the findings to the world. (More on that below.) A bit more detail on the cost of these drugs, and a bit more restraint in discussing the outcomes of a small group of women who were taking a particular class of beta-blocker and had much better survival statistics, would have rounded out this story.

It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.\n\n“All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.\n\n“We worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,” Yarnitsky added by email.\n\nThe study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.\n\nParticipants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what’s known as aura\n\nOverall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.\n\nResearchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.\n\nThe four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.\n\nWhen researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nAt the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nThe timing of treatment also mattered.\n\nPeople who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.\n\nEven though the study’s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.\n\nThe technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn’t involved in the current experiment.\n\nOne shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.\n\n“Rapid and sustained relief is what patients want,” Schoenen added.\n\nIf the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.\n\n“The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2lsKXgQ Neurology, online March 1, 2017.']","However, we do wish the projected cost of the treatment had been included, as well as a discussion on migraine treatments in general.","This Reuters story pulls readers in with the idea that, one day, people might reduce migraine pain with a smartphone-connected tool. The report highlights a new Neurology journal study of Nerivio Migra, a battery-powered device that uses low-intensity electric shocks to the skin, a method called “transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation” (TENS) and which theoretically blocks pain signals in nerves to reduce the severity of migraines. Similar devices have been FDA-approved for use on the head, which doesn’t necessarily mean they work — only that they’re relatively safe to use — and this study tried TENS on patients’ upper arms (a more discreet location) to see if it had any effect.
The story carefully hedges the benefits of the therapy, and it’s a wise move: only 71 middle-aged people were studied, most of them women, and not all of them received the actual treatment due to its double-blind setup. We do wish the projected cost of the treatment had been included, as well as a discussion on migraine treatments in general.

About 24 million Americans take the drugs — marketed under such commercial names as Pravachol, Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor — largely to stave off heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn article in Monday\'s Health section on the effectiveness of statins said that the drugs appeared on the American pharmaceutical landscape in the late 1990s. The first statin, lovastatin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing in 1987 and appeared on the U.S. market the same year.At the zenith of their profitability, these medications raked in $26.2 billion a year for their manufacturers. The introduction in recent years of cheaper generic versions may have begun to cut into sales revenues for the brand-name drugs that came first to the market, but better prices have only fueled the medications\' use: In 2009, U.S. patients filled 201.4 million prescriptions for statins, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescription drug trends. That\'s nearly double the number of prescriptions written for statins in 2001, four years after they arrived on the American pharmaceutical landscape.But in recent months the drugs\' touted medical reputation has come under tough scrutiny.Statins were initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of repeat heart attacks and strokes in patients with high cholesterol who had already had a heart attack. And used for that purpose — called ""secondary prevention"" — the drugs are powerful and effective medications, driving down patients\' risk of another heart attack or stroke by lowering their levels of LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol.Then physicians came to believe statins could also reduce the risk of a first heart attack in people who have high LDL cholesterol but are nonetheless healthy. This use of statins — called ""primary prevention"" — has driven the growth in the market for statins over the last decade.Today, a majority of people who use statins are doing so for primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It is this use of statins that has come under recent attack.""There\'s a conspiracy of false hope,"" says Harvard Medical School\'s Dr. John Abramson, who has cowritten several critiques of statins\' rise, including one published in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine. ""The public wants an easy way to prevent heart disease, doctors want to reduce their patients\' risk of heart disease and drug companies want to maximize the number of people taking their pills to boost their sales and profits.""Heart patients and their physicians are not the only ones to pin their hopes on statins. The drug companies that brought statins to the market have explored the medications\' benefits in prevention or treatment of such conditions as Alzheimer\'s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, prostate and breast cancer, kidney disease, macular degeneration and diabetic neuropathy. Although clear proof that statins could forestall or treat any of these diseases might bring in millions of new, paying customers, results have largely been mixed, inconclusive or disappointing.In an ideal world, debate over the clinical virtues or vices of a drug would be long settled by the time the medication saw a meteoric rise in use. But in a healthcare system that relies on commercial incentives to spur drug development, prescription medications are a product like any other.The FDA assesses drugs\' safety and effectiveness for specific use; but its judgments are based on preliminary data, most of it generated by a drug company seeking approval for its product. Once the agency approves a drug for marketing, the company that makes it will move quickly and aggressively to expand the universe of patients taking its product.Sometimes, by the time the deliberate pace of medical research and debate suggests that a drug is not all it\'s been cracked up to be, it\'s already become a bestseller. Statins, say some who study the relationship between medicine and the drug industry, seem to fit that pattern.Statins appear to drive down the risk of heart attack or stroke by lowering the levels of fatty deposits circulating in the bloodstream. Research suggests that the drugs dampen inflammatory processes that can prompt deposits of plaque to break away from blood vessel walls and cause sudden blockages of arteries leading to the heart or brain.And yet, the relationship between cholesterol-lowering and heart disease is not perfectly understood, and the precise role of inflammation in heart disease is also uncertain.Statins certainly decrease rates of heart attack in people who have clear signs of cardiovascular disease, but it\'s not so clear they work that way in people who are healthy. In spite of that uncertainty, statins\' use for primary prevention has skyrocketed.That\'s the issue in the latest round of debate, which spilled onto the pages of the Archives of Internal Medicine in late June: whether statins prevent, safely and at a reasonable cost, the development of cardiovascular disease in people who are still healthy but are considered to be at high risk of a heart attack or stroke.In the first of three studies published in the Archives last month, medical researchers found that, contrary to widely held belief, statins do not drive down death rates among those who take them to prevent a first heart attack. A second article cast significant doubt on the influential findings of a 2006 study, called JUPITER, that has driven the expansion of statins\' use by healthy people with elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation. A third article suggested potential ethical, clinical and financial conflicts of interest at work in the execution of the JUPITER study and concluded the widely hailed trial was ""flawed"" and raises ""troubling questions concerning the role of commercial sponsors.""""Tens of billions of dollars of revenue for the sponsor over the patent life of the drug were at stake in the JUPITER trial, as well as potentially millions of dollars in royalties for the principal investigator,"" wrote Dr. Lee Green of the University of Michigan Medical School in an editorial accompanying the trio of studies. ""Doubtless, both sponsor and investigative team believe they made their design decisions for the right reasons,"" Green added. ""But social psychology research provides abundant evidence that we human beings both respond strongly to self-interest incentives and firmly believe that we do not.""Statins still have ardent admirers, including cardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. For many patients on a clear collision course with heart disease but not there yet, he said, statins make a difference. And even though recent studies question whether statins reduce heart attack deaths, Nissen added, many patients\' lives are clearly improved by pushing a heart attack further into the future.The stakes of this debate are big and continuing to grow (see related story, "" Pinning down the side effects of statins ""). As many as three-quarters of patients currently taking statins haven\'t yet had a stroke or heart attack; they have diabetes or high LDL cholesterol, conditions widely thought to put them at high risk of having one.Those patients largely joined the ranks of statin consumers after 2001, when the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute adopted guidelines on the treatment of patients with high cholesterol. The guidelines, updated again in 2004, suggested that as many as 36 million Americans should take statins — essentially tripling overnight the potential American market for the drugs. Of the nine experts involved in drafting the cholesterol treatment guidelines, the National Institutes of Health later acknowledged that eight had substantial financial ties to statin makers — links that may have predisposed them to view evidence of statins\' benefit in its most positive light.Said Abramson, the author of ""Overdosed America: The Broken Promise of American Medicine"": The best way to drive down the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place is to exercise regularly, not smoke, drink in moderation and eat a healthy Mediterranean-style diet. But, he added, ""this message gets drowned out by the commercial interests"" of pharmaceutical companies who stand to benefit from increased sales.']","This story does a masterful job of explaining how statins have become such a dominant force despite some of the conflicting evidence about their benefits. Good breakdown of difference between ""primary"" and ""secondary prevention."" ","Recent research suggests that patients who are on statins may not be seeing the benefits promised them. If true, this would mean that the majority of the 24 million Americans taking statins are only contributing to record sales for a very profitable class of drugs instead of making lifestyle changes that could actually have a greater impact on improving their health. Far too few stories take a critical view of the science behind statins.  
The story could have spent a little more time on the actual data that are in dispute – even one paragraph on both the benefits that statins offer as a ""secondary prevention"" and the false hope they may offer to patients as a ""primary prevention.""

Scott Turner, professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center and his team created a purified form of resveratrol, which is being studied in both animal and human studies for preventing age-related conditions such as diabetes and cancer. In a study published in Neurology, he described how they randomly assigned half of a group of 119 men and women to take up to 1,000 mg of resveratrol daily, and the other half to a placebo, for a year. All of the participants had mild or moderate Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAt the end of the year, Turner compared the people’s scores on cognitive tests and assessments of how independent they were in their daily living from the start of the study.\n\n“My nightmare was that nothing would be different from the placebo group, and there would be nothing of interest to talk about,” he says. “But that did not happen. I think resveratrol is an engaging target that’s very interesting and could be pharmacologically manipulated to develop a treatment.”\n\nMORE: Red Wine Not That Healthy After All, Study Shows\n\nThe resveratrol group showed no change in the levels of a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Turner’s group also measured the protein in spinal fluid and blood, and did not see differences over the year in the resveratrol group. That’s likely because experts believe that as Alzheimer’s progresses, more of the protein plaques form in the brain, and less of the protein is released to the rest of the body.\n\nThe resveratrol group also showed smaller brain volume, which in the case of Alzheimer’s is a positive sign, as the disease can cause inflammation and swelling that can interfere with nerve connections.\n\nMORE: Noteworthy Advances in Alzheimer’s Research\n\nEven more encouraging, the people who were treated showed slight improvements in their ability to maintain certain daily activities on their own, such dressing and bathing themselves.\n\nHow resveratrol may be affecting the Alzheimer’s disease process isn’t clear yet.\n\nTurner says the findings don’t suggest that red wine is a cure for Alzheimer’s. The amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently — around what would be contained in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nPlus, he says, resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are “unregulated and we don’t know how much is in it. We need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target Alzheimer’s.”\n\n5 Horrible Habits You Need to Stop Right Now Chris Pecoraro—Getty Images Sam Edwards—Getty Images/Caiaimage Jetta Productions—Getty Images by nacoki ( MEDIA ARC )—Getty Images/Flickr RF Reza Estakhrian—Getty Images 1 of 5 Advertisement\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story misstated that all the participants were men. The study included men and women.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']","This story fell short on most of our criteria and presented an unbalanced, overly sensational account of the study.","Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.
This story reports on a recent well done randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that finds high doses of resveratrol can have an effect on the production of a biomarker associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The story also highlights some modest gains in patients’ ability to perform daily tasks. However, the story seems to reach farther than the evidence and could easily mislead readers who are looking for ways to fight the symptoms of Alzheimer’s — for themselves or loved ones. The headline, “New Evidence Resveratrol May Slow Alzheimer’s,” is particularly off base, as there’s no evidence presented in this study to indicate a slowing of Alzheimer’s progression. The story’s characterization of brain shrinkage in the resveratrol group as a “positive sign” is similarly problematic, as it’s far from clear that a shrinking brain is a good thing for anyone. An independent source would likely have helped this story provide a more thorough and accurate evaluation of the study and its implications. A competing CNN story did feature such a perspective and, perhaps as a result, was better.

Neurologists estimate that about 38% of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen, and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs, according to Dr. Stephen D. Silberstein, a neurologist at the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in New Orleans.\n\nIt would seem that migraineurs would be eager to stop these headaches before they start. In a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families, this is how migraines are described:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Migraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches. Each headache may last from four hours to two days. It can cause throbbing pain in the head. Other symptoms may include nausea (upset stomach), vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound. Most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly.”\n\nYuck.\n\nPeople whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs, the guidelines say. But for those who can, the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium (Depakote), sodium valproate (Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor) and topiramate (Topamax or Topiragen). Beta-blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions, though metoprolol (Lopressor or Toprol), propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) can also help with migraines.\n\nThe authors also noted that frovatriptan (Frova), which is used to treat migraine symptoms, can also help prevent menstrual migraines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese medications “are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,” Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications.\n\nIn addition, an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called Petasites or butterbur was found to be effective, according to the review.\n\nThe review identified a handful of drugs that “are probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention.” These include the antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep or Vanatrip) and venlafaxine (Effexor); the beta blockers atenolol (Senormin or Tenormin) and nadolol (Corgard); and for menstrual migraines, naratriptan (Amerge) and zolmitriptan (Zomig).\n\n“People need to keep in mind that all drugs, includingover-the-counter drugsand complementary treatments, can have side effects or interact with other medications, which should be monitored,” Silberstein said in a statement.\n\nFive of the six co-authors of the new guidelines, including Silberstein, disclosed that they receive research funding, speaking fees and other payments from drug companies.\n\nThe guidelines will be published in Tuesday’s edition of the journal Neurology. They were developed in conjunction with the American Headache Society. You can read the new guidelines here, or check out the patient-friendly summary here.\n\nReturn to the Booster Shots blog.']",This story pointed out the many connections between the guideline authors and the drug industry–something the ,"The story was also silent about costs, did not include an independent perspective, and pulled a quote from a press release from the American Academy of Neurology. Had it covered the topic more thoroughly, this story would probably have been less confused as to why so many patients choose not to prevent headaches merely “by swallowing a few pills.” The issue is far more complex than that.

However the inulin-propionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone.\n\nAfter drinking the milkshakes, the participants in the current study underwent an MRI scan, where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad, fish and vegetables or chocolate, cake and pizza.\n\nThe team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These areas, called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens, found in the centre of the brain, have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food.\n\nThe volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods. The results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulin-propionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing.\n\nIn a second part of the study, which is published in July edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce, and asked to eat as much as they like. When participants drank the inulin-propionate ester, they ate 10 per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone.\n\nIn a previous research study by the same team, published in 2013, they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulin-propionate ester supplement to their food every day, gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals.\n\nProfessor Gary Frost, senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said: ""Our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight -- but we did not know why. This study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw -- and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat.""\n\nHe added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult: ""The amount of inulin-propionate ester used in this study was 10g - which previous studies show increases propionate production by 2.5 times. To get the same increase from fibre alone, we would need to eat around 60g a day. At the moment, the UK average is 15g.""\n\nClaire Byrne, a PhD researcher also from the Department of Medicine explained that using inulin-propionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain: ""If we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods."" She added that some people\'s gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others, which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight.\n\nDr Tony Goldstone, co-senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine added: ""This study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be.""\n\nDr Douglas Morrison, author of the paper from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre at the University of Glasgow, commented: ""We developed inulin-propionate ester to investigate the role of propionate produced by the gut microbiota in human health. This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice. This study also sheds new light on how diet, the gut microbiome and health are inextricably linked adding to our understanding of how feeding our gut microbes with dietary fibre is important for healthy living.""\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council']",Some focus on the limitations associated with this preliminary study on a dietary supplement were in order.,"This news release describes results of a small, preliminary study that adds a bit more tantalizing evidence that a dietary supplement derived from a gut bacteria product may reduce appetite for high-calorie foods. The product is inulin propionate ester, a concentrated form of a compound released by normal gut bacteria when they digest a form of fiber called inulin. In turn, that compound is thought to send signals to the brain’s appetite centers that reduce food cravings.
The release, issued by Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow, does a good job of explaining how the gut-brain-satiety issues were studied in 20 human volunteers, and a decent job of framing the findings as evidence for — if not proof of — the principle that altering the gut’s microbiome can affect the regulation of appetite, food choices and possibly weight gain. But the release is much too light on quantification of the results, the limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies and information on the 20 participants. It also omits information on any potential risks associated with the experimental supplement and the fact that an inulin powder supplement product has already made it to market.

""CMA should be added to first-tier genetic testing for autism spectrum disorders.""\n\nThe study appeared online March 15 and will be published in the April print issue of Pediatrics.\n\n""When parents have a child diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, one of the first questions they often ask is \'how did this happen?\' "" said Dr. Robert Marion, a pediatric geneticist at Children\'s Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.\n\n""In the vast majority of cases, we believe there is at least a genetic predisposition to autism, but the ability to identify a specific genetic cause has been very elusive,"" Marion said. ""Part of that is because of the technology that\'s been available. A larger part is at this point, we just don\'t fully understand what the genetic mechanism that leads to autism is.""\n\nStandard practice is to offer children with autism two tests as a first-line genetic work-up: karyotype and fragile X testing, the researchers said.\n\nIn karyotyping, forms of which have been around since the 1960s, geneticists use a microscope to look for chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with autism, explained Dr. David Miller, a clinical geneticist and assistant director of the Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory at Children\'s Hospital Boston, which conducted the new research along with Boston\'s Autism Consortium.\n\nLike karyotyping, CMA also looks for chromosomal abnormalities, but does so at 100 times the resolution of the earlier test, Miller said. CMA, a genome-wide test, can identify sub-microscopic deletions of duplications of DNA sequences, called copy-number variants, known to be associated with autism, he said.\n\n""Think of chromosomes as a library full of books and each book as a gene,"" Miller said. ""What we look for are shelves of books that have gone missing, which represent a missing fragment of a chromosome, or extra fragments of chromosome, that could contain genes related to autism.""\n\nWhile both Children\'s Hospital Boston and Montefiore have offered CMA testing for several years, not all hospitals do, nor does all insurance pay for it, the researchers noted.\n\nThe main purpose of genetic testing of children with autism is to help parents determine if they\'re at a higher risk of having another child with autism, Marion said.\n\nIf tests pinpoint an autism-related chromosomal abnormality in the child, the parents are then offered testing. If a parent is also found to have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the couple is at higher risk of having a child with autism. (The precise risk depends on what the variant is.)\n\nBut if the parents don\'t have the abnormality, geneticists conclude that the deletion or duplication happened by chance, and the parents are probably not at any greater risk of having another child with autism than the general population, Marion said.\n\nStill, there is much geneticists can\'t tell parents. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases can be traced to a known genetic cause, the researchers noted. Of that, CMA alone can detect 7 percent of those.\n\nThere are a few other genetic tests that can explain another few percentage points of autism cases.\n\nBut that leaves 85 percent or more families with little explanation for the disorder, Marion said.\n\n""CMA is better, but it\'s not great,"" Marion said. ""The vast majority of children who have autism have no identifiable genetic markers that will help in genetic counseling for future pregnancies. That is very frustrating.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more on autism.']","The concluding quote was important: ""(This test) is better, but it’s not great.

The hope is that an artificial pancreas will closely mimic the way the human pancreas normally releases insulin in response to food or stress.\n\nAn effective artificial pancreas has the potential to vastly improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body\'s immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroys so many beta cells that someone with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce the insulin the body needs.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that\'s essential for the body to use sugar as fuel. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn\'t survive. But, replacing insulin isn\'t easy.\n\nWhile too little insulin can be deadly, too much insulin can also cause serious problems, and in the worst case, coma and death. Replacing insulin is a delicate balancing act, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring.\n\nPrevious research suggests that in a 24-hour period, the average person with type 1 diabetes spends about 10 hours with blood sugar levels too high, and about an hour a day with blood sugar levels too low, according to Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\nThe current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. The first trial was meant to mimic a night of eating at home, while the second trial was designed to simulate an evening out, including drinking alcohol, which can unpredictably lower blood sugar levels.\n\nFor the eating-in portion of the randomized study, 12 of the study volunteers were assigned to consume a medium-sized meal (60 grams of carbohydrates) at 7 p.m., and then another half were placed on the artificial pancreas program during the night, while the other half maintained their standard insulin pump therapy. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.\n\nThe second arm of the trial simulated a meal out. The other 12 volunteers were given a larger meal (100 grams of carbohydrate) at 8:30 p.m., and were dispensed white wine along with their meal. As with the other trial, half were managed with the artificial pancreas while the others used conventional insulin pump therapy.\n\nBoth groups were monitored twice overnight in each study.\n\n""For the eating-in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15 percent,"" said Hovorka. For the eating out scenario, the average time good blood sugar control was increased was 28 percent on average. And, when combined, the average increase in blood sugar control was 22 percent, according to the study.\n\nOf greater concern to most people with type 1 diabetes is the ability to avoid low blood sugars while they\'re sleeping. The study found no serious low blood sugar events after midnight. There were four instances of severe hypoglycemia, but the researchers attributed three of them to insulin administered prior to the start of the study in the evening.\n\nResults were published online in the British Journal of Medicine on April 14.\n\nAlthough an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still ""in its infancy,"" some experts were cheered by the findings.\n\n""This study is more good news, and we\'re seeing an evolution of more and more sophistication in this closed loop study,"" said Kowalski. ""What we\'re doing now is pressing these systems in real situations with the goal of getting to the next step of testing at home,"" he added.\n\nHovorka said his team is working on developing a home trial now, and hopes to begin home trials by the end of the year.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about type 1 diabetes from the Nemours Foundation.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story provided a lot of numbers but not enough clarity for readers.  Even the published study did a better job explaining limitations of the evidence. </span>","The story could have benefited from some strong, independent voices commenting on the findings and from a more careful explanation of the study itself.

ALPMY -0.78% of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe two blockbuster drugs have significantly extended survival for many patients with advanced prostate cancer. But in a study published last month, patients who tested positive for the anomaly—a variant of the androgen receptor called AR-V7—lived substantially longer if they were treated with chemotherapy than those given the two new drugs. The receptor is the target of the new drugs.\n\n“If AR-V7 was present, the patients didn’t respond to the [new] agents,” said Howard Scher, chief of genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. “They progressed more quickly and they didn’t live as long” as those treated with chemo. Dr. Scher is lead author of the study, which was published online by the journal JAMA Oncology.\n\nThe findings suggest that patients with the variant can improve their survival chances while avoiding use of the more-costly therapies. Xtandi’s price is $9,370 a month while Zytiga’s is about $8,600. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, the standard so-called taxane chemotherapies for advanced prostate cancer, cost several hundred dollars a month, researchers said.\n\n“You get both improved clinical outcome and economic benefits to the health system,” said Murali Prahalad, Epic’s president and chief executive.\n\nThe retrospective study involved 161 men. Researchers said the test needs further validation in larger, prospective randomized trials. The companies believe the recent study, and previous research linking a poor response to the two drugs to the AR-V7 variant, are sufficient validation for clinical use, said Phil Febbo, Genomic Health’s chief medical officer. They plan to launch the test early next year while more rigorous studies are under way. The price hasn’t been determined.\n\nThe companies estimate that about 50,000 U.S. patients a year have advanced prostate cancer that has progressed after standard hormone therapy and would be candidates for the test as they and their doctors consider treatment with the new agents. Studies suggest as many as 20% may have the AR-V7 variant, or acquire it as their tumors change during courses of therapy.\n\nThe agreement bolsters Genomic Health’s portfolio of cancer diagnostic tests intended to help doctors tailor treatment based on the molecular traits of their patients’ tumors. Its OncotypeDX line of tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers gives patients with early-stage disease information on whether they’re likely to benefit from chemotherapy—or in the case of the prostate, other aggressive care—as part of their treatment. The new pact is part of Genomic Health’s plan to provide diagnostics to guide treatment for metastatic, or advanced disease.\n\nThe test is called a liquid biopsy because it analyzes blood instead of tumor tissue to determine if the mutation is present. It is based on technology that cannot only detect AR-V7 but also determine whether it is in the nucleus of individual tumor cells.\n\nThe presence of the AR-V7 in the nucleus is a key factor in whether patients respond to the new drugs, Dr. Scher said. In the study, no patient determined to have the variant in a single tumor cell’s nucleus responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga.\n\nIn the study, a positive test for AR-V7 didn’t assure patients would respond to the chemotherapy, nor did a negative test promise a response to the Xtandi or Zytiga.\n\nUnder the agreement, which covers commercializing the test in the U.S., Genomic Health is making an equity investment in Epic. Specific financial terms weren’t disclosed.\n\nQiagen NV of Germany and Tokai Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, are codeveloping an AR-V7 liquid biopsy test based on different technology as a diagnostic test for Tokai’s experimental prostate-cancer drug called galeterone intended to treat men who test positive for AR-V7.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nThe wholesale acquisition cost of the prostate cancer drug Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. of Japan and Medivation Inc., is about $9,400 a month compared to about $8,600 for rival drug Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson. An earlier version of this article quoted Xtandi’s price as more than $10,000, using the average wholesale price, which is higher than the wholesale acquisition cost. (July 8, 2016)\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com']",A nod to conflicts of interest and the inclusion of independent experts would have provided crucial balance to a story dominated by commercial concerns.,"This story describes the upcoming commercialization by Genomic Health and Epic Sciences of a diagnostic blood test which could help determine whether men with advanced prostate cancer should receive new-generation drugs or chemotherapy. The test detects whether the genetic variant AR-V7 is present in tumor cells circulating in the blood stream, and a study in JAMA Oncology found that drugs which target androgen receptors are not as effective as chemotherapy for tumors with the AR-V7 variant.
The article does a good job of explaining how this new approach could not only lead to better outcomes for patients by enabling clinicians to tailor treatments to individuals, but could also save money being spent on an expensive class of drugs that would not work for some patients. The story is careful not to overstate how useful the test would be in practice, since there have not yet been randomized clinical trials to quantify the impact on patient survival.
However, readers are left somewhat in the dark about how strong the evidence is in favor of the test, and the companies’ claims that there is enough evidence for the test to move into the clinic based on a fairly small retrospective study should have been interrogated.
Moreover, readers are not made aware that the lead author has significant ties to the makers of the prostate cancer drugs in question, and the majority of the co-authors are employees of Epic Sciences. A nod to conflicts of interest and the inclusion of independent experts would have provided crucial balance to a story dominated by commercial concerns.

This common practice is based on the assumption that it will help them recover more quickly. An international study coordinated at KU Leuven, Belgium, has now disproven this theory. The study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster.\n\nCritically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently. The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care. This artificial nutrition is meant to strengthen their muscles, prevent complications, and speed up their recovery. The artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream.\n\nAn international team of researchers from University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium), Sophia Children\'s Hospital Rotterdam (The Netherlands), and Stollery Children\'s Hospital Edmonton (Canada) has now challenged the validity of this common practice. They conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved 1,440 critically ill children. The researchers examined whether fasting or receiving very small amounts of feeding during the first week in the paediatric intensive care unit was better for the children than full feeding through an IV.\n\nThe results are remarkable. ""We found that the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery"", says lead author Professor Greet Van den Berghe from KU Leuven / University Hospitals Leuven. ""On the contrary, the children who had built up a nutritional deficiency after receiving little to no feedings had fewer infections, less organ failure, and a quicker recovery than children who had been fed through the IV. The effect was present in everyone, regardless of the type of disease, the children\'s age, or the hospital in which they were staying."" These findings provide strong evidence against current practice and can thus be expected to change paediatric intensive care worldwide.\n\nPrevious research by Professor Van den Berghe and her team (2011 and 2014) had already shown that early artificial feeding should be avoided to treat adults in intensive care.\n\n###']",This news release could leave some readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness.,"This brief news release, issued by a university hospital system in Belgium, is loosely based on published results of a multinational, randomized clinical study designed to test the value of adding early intravenous macronutrient feedings to the nutritional care of critically ill children in intensive care units who are unable to eat or be fed normally. Such so-called “total” parenteral nutrition, delivered via the bloodstream, is commonplace in pediatric ICUs, researchers say, because of concerns that “macronutrient deficits” will lead to increased infections, weakness, and longer stays on ventilators and in ICUs overall. The problem, however, has been the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence for this assumption in children, and — significantly — growing evidence in studies of adults that the practice actually delays healing and increases infections.
The study on which the release is based does indeed add strong clinical evidence that the same is true for children, and that delaying for a week or so the use of full parenteral feedings is clearly associated with lower rates of infections and earlier discharge from the ICUs. But this release could leave some readers with the misconception that starving critically ill children will hasten their recovery from a critical illness. Here’s why: contrary to the language in the release, the study did not “prove” the idea that “receiving little or no nutrition” in the first week of an ICU stay “makes children recover faster.” Nor were these children “fasting,” in the conventional sense. In fact, all of the children received micronutrients (such as vitamins and minerals), blood sugar controls, and “enteral” nutrition in which some nutrients are delivered through a tube from the nose to the stomach. The release further misleadingly implies that “nutritional deficiency” somehow directly leads to faster and better recoveries for seriously ill children; in fact, the authors of the published study report that the reason for the benefit of delaying total parenteral nutrition remains “speculative,” but possibly due to complex effects of digestion and metabolism that have an impact on the immune system.

But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.\n\nThe BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.\n\nEarlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).\n\n“There’s a lot of controversy even among experts,” said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.\n\nFor 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health.\n\n“Are patients better off getting these much broader tests?” he said. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”\n\nAccording to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said.\n\nSeveral of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.\n\nThe researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.\n\nIncluding another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.\n\nEven among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.\n\nOften these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.\n\nMultigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.\n\nThough these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.\n\n“We do not advocate for broad population-based screening,” he said. “The interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.” The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.\n\n“Many cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,” Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.\n\n“Yet thousands of women and their physicians are ignoring this advice, ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,” Swisher writes. “The train has left the station and is unlikely to return,” so it is important to assess how useful this additional testing can be, she concludes.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1L98e2E and bit.ly/1L98pLj JAMA Oncology, online August 13, 2015.']",A pretty solid report on a study of multi-gene cancer test panels.

The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes.  It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering.

Researchers say that rate of tumor control is more than double that found with conventional radiation treatment for inoperable lung cancer.\n\nResearchers say surgical removal of tumors is the standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer, but some people are not candidates for surgery due to other coexisting illnesses such as emphysema and heart disease.\n\nIn these situations, the lung cancer tumor is deemed inoperable and conventional radiation therapy or observation without cancer treatment is offered. Neither option is considered ideal.\n\n""Conventional radiotherapy fails to durably control the primary lung tumor in 60 percent to 70 percent of patients. More than half of patients ultimately die specifically from progressive lung cancer with observation, and 2-year survival is less than 40 percent with either approach,"" write researcher Robert Timmerman, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, and colleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nIn the study, researchers evaluated the safety and effectiveness of SBRT in treating 55 people with early-stage but medically inoperable lung cancer.\n\nSBRT is a noninvasive type of cancer treatment in which many small, highly focused radiation beams are used to deliver concentrated doses of radiation to tumor targets over a series of one to five treatments.\n\nThree years after the treatment, the study showed that 28 participants had a complete response to the therapy and 21 had a partial response. Fourteen participants had recurrence of cancer.\n\nOverall, the rate of complete plus partial response after therapy was 89%. Disease-free survival and overall survival three years after treatment were 48.3% and 55.8%, respectively.\n\nNineteen participants (16.3%) experienced significant but not deadly treatment-related side effects.\n\nThis type of radiation therapy has not yet been approved by the FDA as a lung cancer treatment, but this study brings it one step closer. The next step is a clinical trial to evaluate the therapy in a larger number of patients and determine the proper dosage for maximum benefit and minimal risk.']","Key elements missing: didn’t discuss costs, didn’t adequately describe harms, didn’t establish the quality of the evidence, and didn’t seek independent perspectives. ","Lung cancer is a devastating diagnosis. Few tumors are caught early; those that are can be successfully treated with surgery. However, some patients are not eligible for surgery for various reasons. For them, radiation may not cure the cancer but may control it for some time. A new type of radiation, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) provides targeted, highly-focused radiation treatment to the tumor while leaving the surrounding tissue intact, important for those whose lung function may already be compromised. A small pilot study published in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association found that SBRT provided improvements in 3-year survival compared to what other studies have shown is achieved with conventional radiation. However, because this was a small, single-institution study with no direct comparison to other treatments, some caution must be taken in interpreting the results.

In order to protect the tooth from infection, a thin band of dentine is naturally produced and this seals the tooth pulp, but it is insufficient to effectively repair large cavities.\n\nCurrently dentists use man-made cements or fillings, such as calcium and silicon-based products, to treat these larger cavities and fill holes in teeth. This cement remains in the tooth and fails to disintegrate, meaning that the normal mineral level of the tooth is never completely restored.\n\nHowever, in a paper published today in Scientific Reports, scientists from the Dental Institute at King\'s College London have proven a way to stimulate the stem cells contained in the pulp of the tooth and generate new dentine - the mineralised material that protects the tooth - in large cavities, potentially reducing the need for fillings or cements.\n\nThe novel, biological approach could see teeth use their natural ability to repair large cavities rather than using cements or fillings, which are prone to infections and often need replacing a number of times. Indeed when fillings fail or infection occurs, dentists have to remove and fill an area that is larger than what is affected, and after multiple treatments the tooth may eventually need to be extracted.\n\nAs this new method encourages natural tooth repair, it could eliminate all of these issues, providing a more natural solution for patients.\n\nSignificantly, one of the small molecules used by the team to stimulate the renewal of the stem cells included Tideglusib, which has previously been used in clinical trials to treat neurological disorders including Alzheimer\'s disease. This presents a real opportunity to fast-track the treatment into practice.\n\nUsing biodegradable collagen sponges to deliver the treatment, the team applied low doses of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) to the tooth. They found that the sponge degraded over time and that new dentine replaced it, leading to complete, natural repair. Collagen sponges are commercially-available and clinically-approved, again adding to the potential of the treatment\'s swift pick-up and use in dental clinics.\n\nLead author of the study, Professor Paul Sharpe from King\'s College London said: ""The simplicity of our approach makes it ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment of large cavities, by providing both pulp protection and restoring dentine.\n\n""In addition, using a drug that has already been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer\'s disease provides a real opportunity to get this dental treatment quickly into clinics.""\n\n###\n\nNotes for Editors:\n\nThe paper \'Promotion of natural tooth repair by small molecule GSK3 antagonists\' by Vitor Neves, Rebecca Babb, Dhivya Chandrasekaran and Paul T Sharpe will be published in Scientific Reports at 10am on Monday 9 January 2017: http://www. nature. com/ articles/ srep39654\n\nProfessor Paul Sharpe is the head of the Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology Division at the King\'s College London Dental Institute.\n\nThe King\'s College London Dental Institute\n\nKing\'s College London Dental Institute is one of the foremost Dental Schools in the world.

None of the key words “mice,” “mouse” or “animal” appear even once in the text.","One of the most basic elements of any news release about a lab study with implications for humans is to make it clear that the study is still at the animal or — in this case — animal cell stage. This release not only skips any mention of mice, it also makes the leap that because the drug in question has “previously been used in clinical trials to treat neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease” that it would speed the pathway for a new dental treatment. The mixing in of references to an experimental Alzheimer’s drug in the headline of this release and the text are confusing and misleading to say the least. (It suggests an Alzheimer’s drug can repair dental cavities by activating dental pulp stem cells.) But the release has so many other problems that just fixing that still would not have provided readers with the information they deserved.

My skateboard- and bicycle-riding son was hit by a car—twice—when he was a teenager. I would have welcomed anything that could have averted those dreadful phone calls from the emergency room.\n\nWhile some bumps and scares are inevitable for active guys like him, serious misadventures with long-lasting repercussions are often par for the course for a subset of them—those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. But a new article suggests that early medication can significantly cut the odds of bad things happening later.\n\nAffecting nearly 9% of all Americans between 4 and 18 years of age, ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and also one of the most misunderstood. Its symptoms color almost every aspect of a child’s life—from being able to focus in school to making and keeping friends, reining in fleeting impulses and assessing risk and danger.\n\nIndeed, accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD, with one 2015 study of over 710,000 Danish children finding that 10- to 12-year-olds with ADHD were far more likely to be injured than other children their age. Drug treatment made a big difference, however, nearly halving the number of emergency room visits by children with ADHD.\n\nMedicating children to address problems with attention and self-control remains controversial. ADHD isn’t visible, like chickenpox, nor immediately life-threatening, like asthma. Its distortion of a child’s ability to meet adults’ expectations creates an atmosphere of frustration and blame. So it’s not often taken for what it really is: a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic roots.\n\nAn enduring myth about ADHD is that children grow out of it in adolescence. We now know that a 5-year-old with a bona fide attentional disorder may well become a dreamy, restless and impulsive teenager and adult. Adolescents with ADHD think even less about consequences than the average teenager and are especially thrilled by novelty. They’re more likely than their friends to drink too much, drive like maniacs, abuse drugs and have unprotected sex.\n\nIt’s a sobering list. But an article published last month by Princeton researchers Anna Chorniy and Leah Kitashima in the journal Labour Economics shows that treating ADHD with medication during childhood can head off later problems. “We have 11 years of data for every child enrolled in South Carolina Medicaid who was diagnosed with ADHD,” Dr. Chorniy told me. The researchers tracked each doctor visit and every prescription, with a sample of over 58,000 children whose health progress they tracked into adulthood.\n\nThis long view let the economists compare the behaviors of teens treated with the most common ADHD medications, such as Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall, to the types of risks taken by other children with ADHD who were not treated. The researchers found fewer and less severe injuries and health problems among the treated children: a 3.6% reduction in sexually transmitted infections; 5.8% fewer children who sought screening for sexually transmitted infections (suggesting they had had an unprotected sexual tryst); and 2% fewer teen pregnancies.\n\nThat adds up to a lot fewer teenagers in trouble.\n\nThe economists did their study based on existing data, but randomized, controlled studies—experiments carefully designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships—have reached the same conclusion: that medication to control ADHD can reduce the high price in psychic pain, loss of educational opportunity and riven relationships. A child whose disorder is diagnosed and treated early by a trained clinician stands a better chance of growing into a healthy and thoughtful adult.']",Readers aren’t given enough evidence for such a big claim to be made.,"This article reports on new findings that link medicating kids with ADHD to “safer” behaviors as they get older.
The story clearly takes the viewpoint that this is the case, and yet we aren’t given enough evidence from the study itself–or other studies alluded to–to make this assessment for ourselves. Instead, we’re given partial “truth-isms” like this statement, which doesn’t really paint the full picture: “Accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD.”
What’s missing? That’s also true for kids who don’t have ADHD, with “unintentional injury” being the top cause of death among all U.S. kids–and young adults, too.
If it were clear that this was an opinion piece designed to advance an argument, we’d be more forgiving of these shortcomings. But we found the piece in the general health section of the website (not with the opinion columns), and the headline reads like a straight news story. Readers may be confused — as we were — as to whether this is objective, balanced news or just a columnist’s attempt to persuade.

It needs to be tested in large trials,"" he said.\n\nHowever, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.\n\nJolly said the lesson from his team\'s trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.\n\n""As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,"" he said.\n\nThe results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology\'s annual meeting in San Diego.\n\nFor the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.\n\nAmong all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn\'t, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.\n\nIn the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly\'s team found.\n\nDr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, ""This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.""\n\nA number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.\n\n""These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,"" Fonarow said.\n\nMore information\n\nVisit the U.S. National Library of Medicine for more on angioplasty.']","This story did an efficient job of checking off most of our boxes. We applaud the 5-star score, but we can never resist the temptation to offer a few suggestions for improvement.","Removing clots during angioplasty to open up a blocked coronary artery has become a common practice.  This study of a large number of randomly selected patients showed that there was little difference between those patients who had only angioplasty and those who had angioplasty and manual removal of blood clots with respect to major cardiac problems (cardiovascular death, recurrent heart attack, cardiac shock, or heart failure) in the six-months after treatment.  Both outcomes were essentially the same.  However, there was an increase in strokes in the 30 days after treatment in patients who had their clots manually removed along with the angioplasty.
The story does a fine job of communicating the major findings of the study and meets the standard on most of our criteria. Apart from some discussion of cost, the main item on our wish list would be more thoughtful evaluation from an independent expert. Although an outside expert is quoted, he doesn’t do much more than affirm that the findings are important. Just how important are they and what should the patient — the target of this story — do with this information?

But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs — including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions — are considered.\n\n“You really want to look at the total cost, because that’s what society has to pay,” said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n“Overall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,” he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. — roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n“In healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. But when you become sicker, laparoscopy is better,” said Oleynikov. “Substantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.”\n\nBut he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. First, it looks only at academic medical centers. And second, it’s not a randomized controlled trial, which means the patients being compared could be different in important ways, explaining at least part of the outcomes of the two types of surgery.\n\nIndeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/oOWUTt Annals of Surgery, online July 29, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is our 1600th story reviewed on this site and it’s a good lesson for others.  It shows again that you CAN satisfy our criteria in fewer than 500 words. </span>","It’s also noteworthy that this reporter’s work consistently scores high in our reviews.  The commitment to excellence is evident.

Results appear online Jan. 22, 2018, in Advances in Dental Research.\n\n""We put the 2012 UCSF clinical study into the real world and showed it works,"" said lead author Peter Rechmann, DMD, PhD, professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences in the UCSF School of Dentistry. ""The patients at high caries risk who used prescription products went down significantly over time in their risk level. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria.""\n\nDental caries (tooth decay) is caused by bacteria on the tooth surface feeding on carbohydrates, then making acids as waste. These acids destroy the protective tooth enamel and the dentin layer beneath it. If not halted or reversed, this leads to a cavity.\n\nCAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA?) is an evidence-based approach to preventing or treating dental caries at its earliest stages. It was launched in 2003 through the UCSF School of Dentistry by the paper\'s senior author, John Featherstone, PhD, MSc, former dean of the school and distinguished professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences.\n\nA dentist who uses CAMBRA obtains the patient\'s dental and medical history and conducts a clinical exam to assess caries early enough to reverse or halt progression and to determine caries risk factors. These factors include, among other things, acid-producing bacteria, frequent eating and drinking of fermentable carbohydrates (""snacking""), and abnormally low saliva flow and function.\n\nFrom this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The treatment plan typically incorporates remineralization through the use of fluoride and/or antibacterial therapies such as chlorhexidine and xylitol, minimally invasive restorative procedures to conserve tooth structure, and regular patient follow up.\n\nThe authors published their initial validation of CAMBRA for ages 6 through adult in 2006, followed by several additional years of data published in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Since then, more than half of the U.S. schools and colleges of dentistry have adopted CAMBRA in one form or another as part of their standard curriculum. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices.\n\nTreatment Effective Even Without Prescription Products\n\nIn the Advances in Dental Research study, Rechmann and his colleagues recruited 20 dentists - 17 in private practice, three in community clinics - to participate in a two-year CAMBRA trial of 460 patients ages 12-65 years old, with 239 in a CAMBRA group and 221 in a control group.\n\nIn the CAMBRA group, high-risk patients received prescription fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse, xylitol mints and fluoride varnish. The control group received regular fluoride toothpaste, an assumed inactive mouth rinse, sorbitol candies and a non-fluoride varnish.\n\nFollow-up visits occurred at six, 12, 18 and 24 months, in which new caries lesions or changes in caries risk level were recorded. Overall, the researchers found that a significantly greater percentage of high-risk participants were classified at lower risk after receiving CAMBRA preventive therapies. Dental decay was low in both groups.\n\nAmong 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk, indicating that the assessment correctly identifies who is at risk for caries.\n\nThe researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study.\n\n""It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,"" Rechmann said. ""More research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control.""\n\nAmong the study limitations, the researchers noted a high study attrition (65 percent), which partly may have contributed to observed declines in risk level at each subsequent recall visit.\n\n###\n\nCo-authors on the paper were Benjamin Chafee, DDS, MPH, PhD, assistant professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences and director of the Global Oral Health program, and Beate Rechmann, research associate, both from the UCSF School of Dentistry.

Malignant cells had spread throughout her body.\n\nSurgeons removed affected lymph nodes but within months tumors appeared in her liver, breast, skull and other lymph nodes. ""My oncologist said this is going to kill you and you need to think about preparing for that,"" Anderson says.\n\nTwo years ago, she gained access to an experimental immune-enhancing treatment in clinical trials at Providence Cancer Center in Portland. Called ipilimumab, it unleashes an all-out immune system attack on cancer cells. At first, the injections caused only side-effects: widespread itching, fatigue, and diarrhea. Worse, Anderson says, ""I could feel the tumors getting bigger. They felt hot to me.""\n\nThen after several months the tumors began to shrink. After one year, the once palpable tumors were no longer detectable in diagnostic scans. While far from a cure, the treatment is the first to improve survival in people with melanoma that has spread, or metastasized, says Dr. Walter Urba, director of cancer research at the Providence Cancer Center. Urba is a co-author of the\n\non ipilimumab published in the New England Journal of Medicine Saturday.\n\nSuccess in a cancer as deadly and difficult to treat as advanced melanoma is raising hopes that the treatment may also prove useful in staving off other tumors, including lung and prostate cancer. Drug companies are racing to develop competing versions of the immune-enhancing therapy, an antibody produced through genetic engineering.\n\n""I would not be here today without it,"" says Anderson, who is undergoing a second round of treatment for resurgent tumors. ""It\'s given me time with my kids, my husband, my family – and it\'s been quality time.""\n\nMelanoma is a rare skin cancer, but accounts for most of the 66,000 annual deaths from skin cancer worldwide. If caught early, before cancer cells break off and spread, surgery can stop melanoma. But most people diagnosed after melanoma has metastasized die within a year.\n\n""For years and years, we\'ve been looking for an effective therapy,"" Urba says.\n\nIpilimumab, nicknamed Ippy, is one of the first antibody-based therapies that use the body\'s immune defenses to destroy cancer cells. The antibodies bind to a specific protein studding the surface of T cells, immune system cells that seek and destroy virus-infected and cancerous cells. The surface protein works like a switch, inactivating T cells after a few days to prevent the immune system from running amok and destroying healthy tissue. The antibodies temporarily jam the switch, allowing T cells to continue attacking cancer tissue for weeks or months – for as long as patients continue to receive injections of the engineered antibody.\n\nMore than 600 melanoma patients took part in the ipilimumab clinical trial at 125 cancer centers in 13 countries. All patients had inoperable cancers with widespread tumors after conventional treatment. Some patients received ipilimumab alone, others it combined with a cancer vaccine called gp100, and a third group received only the cancer vaccine.\n\nIpilimumab appeared to double survival compared with the gp100 vaccine alone. After one year, nearly half of patients given ipilimumab alone or in combination remained alive, compared with one quarter of patients given only the vaccine. After two years, 24 percent of patients treated with ipilimumab were alive, 22 percent of patients treated with the combination, while survival dropped to 14 percent among patients treated with the vaccine alone.\n\n""Some of the people are now out 44 months and still remain free of disease,"" Urba says.\n\nSerious side effects also became clear. Nearly two-thirds of patients on ipilimumab experienced side effects caused by over-active immunity, such as severe itching, intestinal irritation and diarrhea. Researchers linked 14 deaths to the study drugs, half caused by immune-system reactions.\n\nStill, the study stands as ""a major landmark in cancer immunotherapy,"" says Dr. Bernard Fox, president of the International Society for Biological Therapy of Cancer. He says the results highlight the potential for using the same approach to treat other cancers. Already, early studies in patients with lung cancer and prostate cancer have produced positive, though inconclusive results.\n\n""There is no reason it can\'t be applied to any of the common tumor types,"" Urba says. ""They all have antigens on their surface that T cells can recognize."" Ongoing trials are testing ipilimumab with other cancer drugs, in different doses and against different cancers.\n\nDrug company Bristol-Myers Squibb told investors the drug could gain regulatory approval as early as next year and become available to cancer patients in 2012. Ipilimumab was developed by Medarex, a New Jersey company owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Other drug companies are at work on competing versions of the immune-enhancing antibody therapy.\n\nFor now, federal regulators have authorized\n\nto people who have serious or immediately life-threatening, inoperable melanoma that has spread, who have no alternative treatment options, and whose physicians believe the drug is appropriate. Providence Cancer Center is the only site in Oregon offering compassionate use of the drug. The Northwest\'s other participating centers are the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Swedish Cancer Institute in Seattle, Providence Cancer Center in Spokane, and Multicare Health System in Tacoma.\n\n--']","You can look all over this story for hype, but there isn’t any.  Just the facts, in a calm, restrained local angle to a national news story. No cures, no breakthroughs, no ""seismic shifts.""  ","It’s really refreshing to see a local newspaper localize a national story and to do so in a responsible way.  Sure, the story led with its personal anecdote.  But the personal trials of being in a trial came through in that anecdote.  And sure, there were company predictions of how quickly this might be approved and on the market (something we think could have been handled better).  But there wasn’t hype.

Seaman\n\nA girl helps herself to a buffet at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York December 16, 2009. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly\n\n(Reuters Health) - - People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study.\n\nTrans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They’re found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.\n\n“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nNew York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city’s five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City’s measure was enacted.\n\nPrevious research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn’t restrict trans fats.\n\nAltogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.\n\nIn 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.\n\nWhile admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.\n\nAfter three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.\n\nAdmissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.\n\nBrandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.\n\nWhen they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren’t driving the findings, the pattern didn’t change.\n\n“We still found the same thing,” Brandt said.\n\nStill, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.\n\nBrandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.\n\n“There has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,” said Brandt. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”\n\nThe findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2otJ6gK JAMA Cardiology, online April 12, 2017.""]",One weak point for the story was the lack of independent sources.,"This story does a good job describing a recent study that looked at the association between a ban on trans fats in food, and New York hospital admissions related to heart disease. The study found a modest reduction in hospitalizations for heart attacks in restricted counties.
The story was careful to not overstate the evidence. This stands in contrast to an Associated Press story we also reviewed, which needed more on the study’s limitations.

''Acupuncture could potentially become an alternative treatment to occlusion [patching] therapy for ambylopia [lazy eye], the researchers write. The study, conducted in China, is published in the Archives of Ophthalmology. U.S. experts familiar with the study call it interesting but say the treatment needs more study and wonder if it would catch on in the U.S.\n\nAcupuncture for Lazy Eye Vs. Patching: Study Details While some previous research has found acupuncture for lazy eye effective, the researchers couldn't find a study that directly compared acupuncture with conventional treatments such as patching. So Dennis Lam, MD, a researcher at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues evaluated 88 children, ages 7 to 12, with the condition known as anisometropic amblyopia, in which there is a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes. They assigned 43 children to the acupuncture group, and they received five treatments a week. Acupuncturists used five different points in the head, face, hand, and leg. The children were instructed to do an hour per day of near-vision activities such as homework or computer work. Another 45 children wore a patch over their normal eye for two hours daily, a typical regimen, and were also asked to do an hour of near-vision activity a day.""]","The better of the two stories we reviewed on the results of this acupuncture trial, this report still leaves the many parents of children with amblyopia without enough information to know if acupuncture could be a reasonable alternative treatment approach.","This was a so-so account of a study that compared acupuncture to using an eye patch for treatment of a certain type of “lazy eye” known as anisometropic amblyopia. It was better than the competing HealthDay coverage at describing the design of the study and quantifying the benefits that can be expected from acupuncture. It noted that children treated with acupuncture had an improvement of a little more than 2 lines on a vision chart — a practical characterization of the effects that was not provided in the rival report. But the coverage shared gaps with HealthDay when it came to discussion of the costs and availability of acupuncture. This story also failed to point out that the researchers might stand to benefit financially from a patent on vision-related acupuncture sites — a conflict that was disclosed in the original research paper and should have been included in this news story.

(Nasdaq: VRAY), maker of the world\'s first and only clinical MRI-guided radiation therapy system, announced today outcomes data presented during the recent 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). This data highlighted compelling early results using the company\'s MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nUnlike any other system on the market today, MRIdian allows clinicians to see the tumor and nearby soft-tissue anatomy throughout radiation treatments using real-time diagnostic MR-visualization. As a result, MRIdian\'s on-table adaptive radiation therapy allows doctors to respond to subtle anatomical changes observed on a day-to-day basis and reshape the dose to better match the current contours of the tumor. By more accurately targeting the tumor, and reducing treatment radiation dose to surrounding organs such as the duodenum, small bowel, stomach and liver, a higher and potentially more effective radiation dose may be delivered without increasing the risks of side effects and complications for the patient.\n\nAs featured in the ASTRO Scientific Session poster titled ""High Dose Adaptive MRI Guided Radiation Therapy Improves Overall Survival of Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer,"" key data points and findings from the presentation include the following:\n\nThe study detailed a retrospective review of 42 locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with MRIdian at four institutions (University of California Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin, VU University Medical Center, Washington University).\n\nThe authors examined survival and toxicity rates for two unique cohorts of patients. One sample received a higher biologically effective dose (maxBED10 >90), primarily enabled by MRIdian MR-guided on-table adaptive radiotherapy. The other sample received a lower, more conventional biologically effective dose (maxBED10 <90), using non-adaptive therapy.\n\nThe cohort receiving a higher dose demonstrated a near doubling of median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 27.8 months compared to 14.8 months).\n\nPatients treated with higher radiation doses reported no grade 3 or higher toxicities (0 percent). In comparison, those patients receiving lower doses via non-adaptive treatments experienced 15.8 percent grade 3 or higher toxicities.\n\n""High-definition MR now enables oncologists to detect the slightest anatomical changes that occur from one day to the next and in real-time while the patient is being treated. Coupled with new adaptive radiation therapy software tools, we create new customized plans in minutes, all while the patient is on the treatment table,"" said Percy Lee, M.D., senior author and Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Education for the Department of Radiation Oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The data presented at the 2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting suggests that higher radiation doses with adaptive MR guided radiation therapy may improve survival in pancreatic cancer while maintaining a very favorable toxicity profile. These outcomes warrant further investigations.""\n\nThe early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay\'s Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy.\n\n###\n\nFor more information regarding this clinical trial, please visit http://go. viewray. com/ pancreatic_cancer_trial_info .\n\nPresentations discussing the multi-institutional poster in ViewRay\'s ASTRO booth are available on the company\'s website at http://www. viewray. com/ ASTRO_2017 .\n\nAbout ViewRay\n\nViewRay®, Inc.

The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.\n\nPatients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. ""The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,"" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, ""We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It\'s exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.""\n\nDr. Charney said, ""Mount Sinai embraces creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

CNN Films Presents:"" Glen Campbell ... I\'ll Be Me ,"" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer\'s disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer\'s suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.\n\nResearchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer\'s.\n\nThe researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer\'s, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.\n\nAlthough accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer\'s disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.\n\nEven if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it\'s too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.\n\n""The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer\'s biomarkers,"" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.\n\nThe main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer\'s, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.\n\nMuch more research is needed\n\nThe study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.\n\nA large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)\n\nEven for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)\n\n""To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),"" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer\'s Association, a research and advocacy organization. ""Other potential therapies we\'ve had had some early exciting results and then they didn\'t pan out in later trials,"" he added.\n\nIf resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.\n\nUltimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer\'s, he added.\n\nAntioxidant may be most effective in combination\n\nThis is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.\n\nIn addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer\'s and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.\n\nThe current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer\'s, ""but no more than that,"" Turner said.\n\nThere is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. ""The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don\'t know how much is in them,"" Turner said. ""There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,"" he said.\n\nPrevious research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.']","After some early missteps, this story recovers to provide readers most of what they need to know about resveratrol’s possible effects on Alzheimer’s disease.","Resveratrol is an antioxidant compound found in grapes and red wine.
Like a competing Time story, this CNN piece overreaches in its description of a randomized controlled trial of resveratrol’s effects on biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease. It suggests that resveratrol “may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease,” which goes beyond anything that this small safety-focused study could tell us. But after that early misstep (and a sensational headline that touts “new hope”), the story recovers to highlight the need for additional work before it can be determined whether resveratrol may be beneficial. And in that respect it goes well beyond the Time coverage. All in all, the story does a nice job of balancing the promise of the work while keeping readers grounded in the reality that we are a long way from finding a new tool to fight Alzheimer’s.

In 2016, breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the United States and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancer-related deaths.\n\nMammography screenings, which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality, are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue. In fact, typical mammography sensitivity, which is 75 to 85 percent accurate, decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue.\n\nCurrent diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks: dual-energy digital mammography, while effective, increases radiation exposure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive. Biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive, equipment-intensive and require significant expertise.\n\n""We\'ve now shown that inexpensive, commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages,"" says Prof. Zeiri.

The findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and presented on Wednesday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Anaheim, California.\n\n“This is indeed a landmark study,” said Cory Abate-Shen, a professor of urological oncology at Columbia University Medical Center who was not involved in the trial. “It suggests that a balanced multivitamin approach is probably more beneficial than increasing to high levels any one vitamin.”\n\nAbout half of U.S. adults take at least one daily dietary supplement - the most popular being a multivitamin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe U.S. Physicians Health Study II included nearly 50,000 male doctors aged 50 and older and spanned more than 10 years. Participants were randomly assigned to a multivitamin - Pfizer Inc’s Centrum Silver - or a placebo. The research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nSeveral previous studies, many relying on self-reported use of specific vitamins or supplements, have generated mixed results in terms of cancer outcomes.\n\n“There have been some other trials that have tested combinations, often at high doses, of certain vitamins and minerals,” said Dr. Howard Sesso, one of the study’s authors and an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Our trial took a very commonly used multivitamin that has basically low levels of all the different essential vitamins and minerals.”\n\nThe findings suggest that the biggest health benefit may come from a broad combination of dietary supplements, he said.\n\nEFFECT IS GREATER FOR NON-PROSTATE CANCERS\n\nLast year, the questionnaire-based Iowa Women’s Health Study found that older women who take multivitamins have slightly increased death rates compared to those who don’t.\n\nA study examining whether vitamin E and selenium could reduce the risk of prostate cancer was stopped prematurely in 2008 after men taking 400 international units (IU) of the vitamin showed an increased risk of developing the cancer. Over-the-counter multivitamins typically contain 15 to 25 IU of vitamin E.\n\nThe newly-released Physicians Health Study showed an 8 percent reduction in total cancer occurrence for participants taking a multivitamin, but no benefit was seen for rates of prostate cancer, the most common cancer seen among the participants in the study.\n\nExcluding prostate cancer, researchers found about a 12 percent reduction in overall cancer occurrence and said the protective effect seemed to be greater in people who had previously battled cancer.\n\nThey also saw a 12 percent reduction in the risk of death from cancer, although those findings also were not statistically significant.\n\nResearchers said they planned to continue to follow the study group to monitor the effect of vitamin intake over time, and said additional studies would be needed to see if there were similar benefits for women or younger men.\n\n“It doesn’t seem like there is any particular risk associated with taking a vitamin and there might be a small benefit,” said Dr. David Weinberg, chief of the department of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He was not involved in the study.']","A solid effort, but readers of this Reuters piece may not appreciate just how small the benefits in this study were.

The story could have emphasized this point even further by explaining what the 8% reduction in cancer means in absolute terms for participants in the study. It would also have done well to compare multivitamins with other approaches to cancer prevention, such as exercise, a healthy diet, and smoking cessation.

Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended — unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.\n\nFully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.\n\nThese facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.\n\nIn a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.\n\nYet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors’ reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use “overly restrictive criteria” when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.\n\nGreater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\nFurthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that “all new insurance plans obtained through the act’s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.” Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.\n\nIn a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that “after decades of dominance by ‘the Pill,’ it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.”\n\nHere is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:\n\n■ They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user’s motivation and reliability.\n\n■ Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.\n\n■ There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.\n\n■ There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.\n\nFurthermore, the committee stated, “almost all women are appropriate candidates” for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).\n\nIn real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.\n\n“While there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,” Dr. Kavanaugh said.\n\nThe etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.\n\nLikewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.\n\nThe copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.\n\nBoth the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Unlike early IUDs no longer in use, “modern IUDs do not carry an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after the first 20 days following insertion,” Dr. Brooke Winner and her colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.\n\nCommon side effects include irregular bleeding during the first few months following the insertion of an implant or IUD. The latter is also associated with some cramping at the time of insertion.\n\nRelated:\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.']",This Jane Brody column takes a pretty careful look at an important women’s health issue.,"Hormonal and copper IUDs.
Changes in the behavior of doctors could make a big difference in how many women opt for using long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). This Jane Brody column reports on a committee’s strong argument urging obstetricians and gynecologists to increase their prescribing of long-acting alternatives. The committee states that only about half of all doctors offer these devices in their practice, even though research shows these alternatives are more effective and relatively safe.
The story does a great job of examining the way that up-front higher cost may be confusing some patients about the true long-term savings these devices can provide. It would have been nice to hear from someone — a clinician perhaps — who does not routinely prescribe LARCs and why that’s the case. What are their concerns and what are the obstacles to making this more widely available?

Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Prudkov and Thinkstock.\n\nIt’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers’ meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.\n\nThe only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.\n\nProzac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. “From a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,” he said.\n\nThere’s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children’s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory—something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.\n\nAnd there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children’s Hospital, says, “It’s complicated, because you’re giving antidepressants when you’re very worried about that young person’s mood.” Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.\n\nA comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. “Only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,” he writes. “For antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.”\n\nTo be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. “They’re not better than nothing,” he said, “and there’s quite clear evidence that they’re more dangerous than nothing.” He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.\n\nHis wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don’t work well in children because they weren’t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.\n\nThe Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.\n\nIf there’s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it’s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” which is has been shown to work, at least by participants’ own assessment of their depression levels (it’s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available—but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.\n\nLike in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.']","This story contained several errors about medical information, especially when it came to the known harms of antidepressants in kids and adolescents.","This story covers a meta-analysis led by a researcher at the University of Oxford (UK) that examined peer-reviewed studies on the effects of 14 antidepressants on children and adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Published in the Lancet, the study found that only fluoxetine, marketed in the U.S. under the name Prozac, was shown in trials to be significantly more effective than placebo, though its clinical effectiveness isn’t clear from available data. The study also found “robust evidence” that the drug venlafaxine (Effexor) raises the risk of suicidal behavior.
The fact that Prozac is singled out in the headline as possibly “the only drug that effectively treats depression in kids” may lead readers to think that there is solid evidence of Prozac’s safety and efficacy, which there isn’t. But more importantly, the story included several errors, which are primarily detailed in the “Harms” criterion below. Example: The story says that “since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality.” This is not true–the FDA did not make such a blanket statement–they note the increased risk of suicidality, but leave it up to physicians to weigh the possible risks vs possible benefits.

Cortisol is known as the “stress hormone” because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope.\n\nThe greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, such as divorce, injury, moving house, severe illness or the death of a family member, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were, the researchers found.\n\nParents – talk to your kids about mental health. Even if it's awkward | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more\n\nIt suggests hair cortisol levels may provide a marker of trauma exposure in children and identify those at risk of developing psychosocial and behavioural problems, and who may need medical and psychological support, leader of the study and a fellow in child and adolescent mental health at the University of Melbourne, Dr Julian Simmons, said.\n\n“Childhood is an imperative and sensitive period of development, and when things go wrong it can have lifelong consequences, not just on mental health, but also on general health,” Simmons said.\n\n“What’s less commonly understood is that beyond poor mental health, it can also be associated with the development of other illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and cholesterol issues, because cortisol is also central to glucose availability, blood pressure and immune function, so identifying these children is important.”\n\nWhile blood or saliva tests could be used to detect cortisol levels, these methods were sometimes problematic, especially in children, Simmons said. Cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate, and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time.\n\nThe tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children, given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand.\n\n“However, hair samples are not only easier to obtain, but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time,” Simmons said.\n\n“Looking at hair tells us new things.”\n\nThe research is part of the ongoing Murdoch Childrens Research Institute’s Childhood to Adolescence Study following a cohort of 1,200 children in and around Melbourne and was published in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology.\n\nSimmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness, with many other social, environmental and genetic factors also involved.\n\nBut it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body’s endocrine system, and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, he said.\n\n“We hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk,” he said.""]",Our first review of a story from the U.S. edition of The Guardian gets a poor grade. It jumps way beyond what this small association study can tell us and makes untenable claims about using the test to predict future mental health problems.,"This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol.
Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it’s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair “may reveal future mental health risk” in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research.

For patients, Gocrovi may be a welcome addition. But there are a number of important unanswered questions that this story doesn’t answer. Notably, that this drug is essentially the same medication as amantadine, which has been used off label for this condition for years. Will Gocovri really be an improvement, or just an expensive version of amantadine?

The discovery was a “serendipitous finding” in the lab of Rajan Sah, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Iowa.\n\n“When we exercise and move our muscles, we activate calcium cycling to cause muscle contraction,” said Sah. “This same calcium signal also activates signaling pathways to increase skeletal muscle endurance and also skeletal muscle size.”\n\nSah’s research team hypothesized that low level calcium cycling induced by these natural compounds might promote improved exercise capacity and overall metabolic health associated with healthy muscle mass.\n\n“We tested these compounds in sedentary mice and found a dramatic improvement in exercise endurance and a mild increase in muscle size of certain muscle groups,” Sah says.\n\nThe intellectual property associated with this discovery was recently licensed by the UI Research Foundation to Innovus Pharma, an over-the-counter consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes non-prescription medicine and consumer care products. The company plans to develop the discovery into an over-the-counter (OTC) product to combat cachexia.\n\n“The oncology supportive care market is a very large unmet medical market with limited choices to both physicians and patients,” said Bassam Damaj, chief executive officer of Innovus Pharma. “The treatment of cachexia just doesn’t exist.

The release cites some pre-clinical animal research at the University of Iowa that suggests that components of the spices oregano and thyme may represent a “cure” for cachexia, a wasting disease that affects cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases. Unfortunately, readers aren’t told that the research was in mice — not humans — until very late in the release.  There’s no information on whether the research has been published, or met any other form of peer review. (When we asked to see the study, the media relations team at the university declined and told us the research hadn’t been published.) The spice compounds referred to aren’t named, nor are cost or potential harms addressed. The release doesn’t explain who funded the research or disclose that the university has applied for a patent on the compound. It doesn’t note that the researcher quoted in the release is listed as the inventor on the patent application and would likely stand to benefit financially from its commercialization. The release does note that a pharmaceutical firm has been licensed to market a drug based on the research.
Editor’s note: This news release raised serious questions about oversight of the University of Iowa’s research-related communications to the public. We blogged about those questions here but have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the university media relations team.   
Update 8/24/17: A response received from the university, more than two weeks after the initial request, raises additional serious questions about the university’s process for promoting research, which critics termed “utterly irresponsible.” We wrote about it here.

Adding to their mystique, they have gained a reputation for their supposed healing powers over the last couple of decades.\n\nFacilities scattered around the world offer various forms of dolphin-assisted therapy for people with mental and physical ailments. Essentially, it’s an expensive opportunity to swim with dolphins. Parents of children with severe autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy or other disabilities spend thousands of dollars on such dolphin-based treatments in hopes that the animals can reach their kids in ways that psychiatrists, physical therapists or medications never could.\n\nOne destination for dolphin-based treatment is Island Dolphin Care in Key Largo, Fla. The center has six Atlantic bottlenose dolphins in a penned-in canal connected to the ocean. (According to the website, the dolphins’ personalities run the gamut from “tomboy” to “Gucci girl.”) The center also has a staff that includes a social worker and three special education teachers, along with speech therapists and other specialists who visit from time to time. A five-day program costs $2,200 and includes about 20 minutes of dolphin time each day. Other time is spent in classrooms or therapy, depending on the needs of the child or the wishes of the parents. The dolphins also work with some adults, including veterans who have lost limbs.\n\nThere don’t appear to be any dolphin therapy programs in California. (You can swim with dolphins at SeaWorld in San Diego, but it’s not offered as therapy.) There are several programs in Mexico, however, including the Living From the Heart Dolphin Experience in Cozumel. The program includes five 40-minute sessions with a single dolphin in a pool over three days. The cost is $575.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims\n\nThe Internet is rife with claims that dolphins can use their natural ultrasound to zap tumors, heal muscle injuries and stimulate the brains of disabled children. Through mechanisms that aren’t completely clear, there are also reports that dolphins have relieved chest pain and restored faulty vision.\n\nA site for a dolphin therapy center in Ukraine says its dolphins can treat chronic fatigue syndrome, headaches, depression and autism, among many other conditions.\n\nThe programs closer to this part of the world tend to be more reserved. The website for Island Dolphin Care doesn’t claim that the dolphins cure any illness, although the dolphins are said to provide “unconditional love and support” to children with disabilities or terminal illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeena Hoagland, a licensed social worker and executive director of Island Dolphin Care, says that dolphins don’t have magical powers. “It’s very irresponsible to give false hope,” she says. She believes the animals bring joy, confidence and self-esteem to children and adults. She adds that dolphin therapy is only a small part of her overall program. “We use traditional treatments in an exciting way,” she says.\n\nThe website for the Living From the Heart Dolphin Experience says that 95% of autistic children who receive dolphin therapy enjoy benefits that last up to two years. Those benefits are said to include longer attention spans, better emotional control and improved communication skills.\n\nMacy Jozsef, the executive director of Living From the Heart, says she has been providing dolphin therapy for more than 20 years. “Nobody really knows why dolphins have the impact that they do,” she says. “I speculate that dolphins help synchronize the left side and right side of our brains, and nothing else does that.”\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you think your child will enjoy splashing around with a big, smart, aquatic mammal, a dolphin experience might be a fine investment. But if you’re looking for a treatment with scientifically proven results, you should look past the dolphin tank.\n\nEven Hoagland agrees that there’s no real research to support dolphin therapy, but she sees that shortcoming in a positive light: “If there’s no science behind it, how can you say that it doesn’t work?”\n\nThere are a few dolphin studies out there, but they don’t add up to much, says Lori Marino, a neuroscience and behavioral biology researcher at Emory University in Atlanta. Japanese researchers published a small study in 2001 suggesting that dolphin therapy can somehow treat eczema, but that finding stretches credulity, Marino says. Another study that year from Australian researchers concluded that swimming with dolphins could improve feelings of well-being while reducing anxiety, but the findings were based on questionnaires given to 168 healthy people who had paid for their adventures, which predisposed them to see the investment as worthwhile. A more plausible study published in the British Medical Journal in 2005 found that dolphin therapy relieved depression symptoms for a group of 13 adults. Marino critiqued these and other studies in a review article published in 2007 in the journal Anthrozoos.\n\nAccording to Marino, the appeal of dolphin therapy is based more on mystical beliefs than on any real results. “Dolphins are the ultimate New Age animals,” she says. But dolphins don’t feel any spiritual imperative to heal humans, as far as anyone knows. Marino adds that the ultrasound that dolphins use to navigate is far too weak to have any medical effect. “People say that swimming with dolphins is fun, but it’s entertainment, not therapy,” she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Ball, chairman of the board of directors of the Autism Society and a behavioral specialist with a practice in Cranbury, N.J., says that some autistic children respond well to animals in general. For example, a child who has trouble reading out loud may be more fluent and confident when reading to a dog. Many autistic children also enjoy being in the water, he says.\n\nIt’s perfectly plausible that some autistic children would become unusually lively and engaged around a dolphin, Ball says, but it’s hard to say that the emotional boost would last. “It’s not like they can swim with a dolphin every day,” he says.\n\nhealth@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The column adroitly addresses the age-old defense of lack of evidence – “If there’s no science behind it, how can you say that it doesn’t work?”</span>","Another strong entry in this regular Healthy Skeptic column by the LA Times, this story provides readers with nearly everything they need to know about dolphin therapy treatment centers.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\n\nThe analysis, which appeared in the Journal of Urology, compared increasingly common robotic surgery with two other techniques for the same surgery and found that direct costs can be up to several thousand dollars higher for the robotic type.\n\nTouted as less invasive and more efficient, robotic surgeries typically use a laparoscopic or “keyhold surgery” approach, in which tools and a tiny video camera are inserted into the body through one or two small incisions.\n\nRobotic surgery replaces a surgeon’s hands with ultra-precise tools at the ends of mechanical arms, all operated by the surgeon from a console.\n\n“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nHu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques.\n\nDuring the last three months of 2008 — the most recent data available that allowed a comparison among robotic, open and laparoscopic surgeries — more than half of all prostate removals involved robot-assisted surgery.\n\nAbout three percent of prostate patients had standard laparoscopic surgery and 44 percent had open surgery. Open and laparoscopic surgeries were still more common than robotic surgeries for kidney repairs and removals.\n\nAmong patients who had their prostate removed, none died from laparoscopic or robotic surgery, whereas two out of every 1,000 died after the open procedure.\n\nAbout five percent of the men who had open surgery needed a blood transfusion, compared to less than two percent of men who had robot-assisted surgery. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group.\n\nThe results were similar for people who had kidneys removed.\n\nThe trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery.\n\nFor kidney removal, robotic surgery cost $13,900, which was $2,700 more than laparoscopic and $1,300 more than open surgery.\n\nDavid Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards. Emphasis should be lmited on procedure, he said, as opposed to surgical skill.\n\n“Years ago, this was thought to be the be-all-end-all operation, particularly with prostate surgery. We were going to get patients out of the hospital quicker, have better potency and incontinence outcomes,” he told Reuters Health.\n\n""And the reality of it is that... there are some benefits -- but not as much as we had hoped."" SOURCE: bit.ly/zZIYa1']","This story gets 4 stars for addressing most of our criteria, but missed some of the meat and misgivings of what was readily available in the written words of the researchers’ conclusion and of the editorial accompanying the study.","We don’t think the story conveyed the conclusion of the researchers, nor that of the the editorial writer.
The researchers concluded:
“While robotic assisted and laparoscopic surgery are associated with fewer deaths, complications, transfusions and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open surgery, robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery is more costly than laparoscopic and open surgery.  Additional studies are needed to better delineate the comparative and cost effectivenss of robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery relative to laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.”
That conclusion sends a somewhat different message than that delivered in the story – and the difference is important.
And the editorial writer stated that the study “failed to capture 3 important elements.” And then he clearly spelled those out.  The story didn’t convey the depth/details of those concerns.

Levels of the protein were markedly lower after surgical removal of a patient\'s tumors. The study was published in the June 24 issue of the journal Nature.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer, with only 4 percent of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. That is due in part to the lack of any easy way to detect the cancer in its earliest stages. The pancreas is located deep within the body, so early tumors cannot be seen or felt during routine physical exams. Patients usually have no symptoms until the cancer has spread.\n\nScientists have uncovered various markers that can be used to detect the cancer through a blood test, but those have been too unreliable to recommend widespread screening.\n\nAs a result, 80 percent of pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in later stages, when surgery is no longer an option.\n\nThe new finding could lead to a blood test that would allow doctors to screen for pancreatic cancer much more effectively. If such a test were developed, it would likely be used first to test patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer. If it can be shown that screening improved outcomes, it could one day be used to screen the general population.\n\n""Studies comparing stage of disease with outcome following surgery suggest that death rates frompancreatic cancer would be reduced if the disease were diagnosed at an earlier stage,"" said Dr. Raghu Kalluri, chair of cancer biology at M.D. Anderson and a co-author of the study. ""This presents an unprecedented opportunity for informative early detection of pancreatic cancer and in designing potential curative surgical options.""']",This story about a new pancreatic cancer test didn’t dig deeper than a news release announcing the study results.,"This brief article announces the discovery of a potential new and highly effective way to detect pancreatic cancer by looking for the presence of a certain type of protein in the blood. The article would have been much stronger had it included interviews with independent sources, and provided attribution for some of the statistics provided. Like the competing NBCNews.com and Los Angeles Times stories that we reviewed, this story passes along the claim that this test is 100% accurate. However, unlike those competing stories, this piece doesn’t in any way try to qualify that claim or address the study’s important limitations.

Researchers conducted a single-center randomized controlled trial of 129 women with singleton pregnancy between 11 and 14 weeks gestation who had double-notching on uterine artery Doppler.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of high-flavanol chocolate in a randomized clinical trial.\n\nStudy Design: We conducted a single-center randomized controlled trial including women with singleton pregnancy between 11 and 14 weeks gestation who had double-notching on uterine artery Doppler. The pregnant women selected were randomized to either high-flavanol (HFC) or low-flavanol chocolate (LFC). A total of 30 g of chocolate was consumed daily for 12 weeks and women were followed until delivery. Uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index (UtA PI), reported as multiple of medians (MoM) adjusted for gestational age, was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after randomization. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, placenta weight, and birthweight were also evaluated.\n\nResults: One hundred twenty nine women were randomized at a mean gestational age of 12.4 ± 0.6 weeks with a mean UtA PI of 1.4 ± 0.4 MoM. Although adjusted UtA PI significantly decreased from baseline to 12 weeks in the 2 groups (<0.0001), the difference between the 2 groups was not significant (p=0.16). At 12 weeks, we observed no significant difference between HFC and LFC groups in the rate of preeclampsia (4.7% vs 3.1%, p=0.49) and gestational hypertension (6.2% vs 12.5%, p=0.56). Placental weight (466 vs 464 grams), p=0.93) and birthweight (3348 vs 3215 grams, p=0.07) were comparable between the two groups.\n\nConclusion: Compared with low-flavanol chocolate, daily intake of 30g of high-flavanol chocolate did not improve placental function, placental weight and the risk of preeclampsia. Nevertheless, the marked improvement of the pulsatility index observed in the 2 chocolate groups might suggest that chocolate effects are not solely and directly due to flavanol content.']",This release hypes an inconclusive study and in the process will mislead some readers into thinking that chocolate helps reduce the risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. A rare 0-star review.,"Just in time for Valentine’s Day, this PR news release describes a study that evaluated the impact of high-flavanol chocolate in reducing preeclampsia risk.
Having discovered that there are no significant differences between the low-flavanol and high-flavanol group in this respect (and, in fact, with respect to all the other secondary outcomes), the study could only conclude flavanol content cannot explain the observed improvement of the pulsatility index, a surrogate variable for blood velocity in the uterine, placental and fetal circulations. Nonetheless, the news release forges ahead and turns this result into a headline that touts the benefits of chocolate during pregnancy, a claim that is completely unsupported by the underlying study. In addition, the news release is almost a word-for-word regurgitation of the attached study abstract. It adds absolutely nothing besides a quote from one of the investigators of the study.
If they read carefully enough, those who wade through the entire news release will eventually learn that chocolate doesn’t in fact help prevent pre-eclampsia. But many will be misled by the headline and vague lead sentence that appear to tout benefits. We can’t even tell what characterizes the women included in the study besides that they “had double-notching on uterine artery Doppler,” again regurgitated with no attempt at explaining its meaning.
The release was issued by the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine in advance of that organization’s annual meeting, where an abstract of the study was presented. The study findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The benefit is greater than with either of the drugs used alone, and the combination has fewer side effects, the researchers reported online in the journal Lancet.\n\nSeveral previous studies have shown conclusively that lifestyle changes and drugs can block progression of the disease in patients at high risk, including those with impaired glucose tolerance and those with impaired fasting glucose tolerance, whose glucose levels are close to the thresholds required to define Type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes have been particularly hard to implement, while many patients have been reluctant to take Avandia (known generically as rosiglitazone) because of reports that it increases the risk of weight gain and heart disease. Some groups have gone so far as to claim that clinical trials with Avandia are unethical because of the risk.\n\nDr. Bernard Zinman of the University of Toronto and his colleagues reasoned that using a combination of two drugs, each at half its normal dose, might provide benefits while minimizing risks. They enrolled 207 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, randomly assigning half to take the combination and half to take a placebo. During the nearly four years of followup, Type 2 diabetes developed in 14% of those receiving the drugs, compared with 39% of those in the placebo group, a 66% reduction in risk. That indicates that four people need to be treated to prevent one case of diabetes.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that metformin alone reduces the risk of progressing to diabetes by about 30%, while Avandia alone produces a maximum risk reduction of 60%.\n\nEighty percent of the patients in the treatment group returned to normal glucose tolerance, compared with 53% of those in the placebo group. Side effects such as weight gain, congestive heart failure and diarrhea were observed only rarely, but it is possible that the study was not large enough to see rare side effects.\n\nThe trial was funded by GlaxoSmithKline, which manufactures Avandia.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the report, Dr. Thomas A. Buchanan of USC and Dr. Anny H. Xiang of Kaiser Permanente Southern California noted that ""the concept of combining submaximum doses of effective drugs to maintain efficacy and reduce side-effects is an attractive one."" But they noted that the regimen did not affect the progression of beta-cell disease in the pancreas, which is the ultimate source of the diabetes, and that a really effective treatment will not be available until that can be done.\n\n-- Thomas H.

Chronic idiopathic constipation is a diagnosis given to those who experience persistent constipation and for whom there is no structural or biochemical explanation.\n\nTrulance, taken orally once daily, works locally in the upper GI tract to stimulate secretion of intestinal fluid and support regular bowel function.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of Trulance were established in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials including 1,775 adult participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or Trulance, once daily. Participants in the trials were required to have been diagnosed with constipation at least six months prior to the study onset and to have less than three defecations per week in the previous three months, as well as other symptoms associated with constipation. Participants receiving Trulance were more likely to experience improvement in the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements than those receiving placebo, and also had improvements in stool frequency and consistency and straining.\n\nTrulance should not be used in children less than six years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration. Trulance should be avoided in patients six years of age to 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Trulance have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age. Trulance should not be used in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.\n\nThe most common and serious side effects of Trulance was diarrhea. Patients may experience severe diarrhea. If severe diarrhea occurs, patients should stop taking Trulance and contact their health care provider.\n\nTrulance is manufactured by New York, New York-based Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n\n###\n\nInquiries Media: Andrea Fischer 301-796-0393 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA\n\nRelated Information']","In both clinical trials cited, the self-reported improvements were about 20% for the drug compared to 10-13% for a placebo. The potential for only a modest benefit isn’t mentioned.","This news release issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announces the agency’s approval of the drug plecanatide (marketed as Trulance) to treat adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), a form of constipation for which there is no consistent medical explanation.
The release notes that there are other treatments for the disorder and that this approval expands the options available. It also nicely clarifies that the drug has not been proven safe for those under age 18 and that it can cause mild to serious diarrhea. But it left out other side effects observed in the studies and is vague about the benefits. It would have been nice to include some numbers to put the potential value of the drug in perspective. It does explain that volunteers in two clinical trials “were more likely to experience improvement” in the frequency of bowel movements than those getting placebo, and “had improvements” in consistency and straining. But some quantitative or qualitative information would have been helpful.
In both clinical trials, the overall positive response rates were about 20 percent compared to 10 to 13 percent for placebo which suggests only a modest benefit — and the release could have pointed that out.

COPD is, as the name suggests, a chronic lung disease that makes it progressively harder to breathe. Although patients currently have several treatment options available to help manage the disease – whose name is an umbrella term encompassing both emphysema and chronic bronchitis – there is no cure.\n\nAlthough it\'s clear that exposure to cigarette smoke is a major cause of COPD, it\'s not the only cause and scientists still aren\'t sure exactly how cigarette smoke and other inhaled irritants can trigger the development of COPD. One working theory is that smoking cigarettes depletes the body of vitamin A, a nutrient that the lungs use to repair themselves.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health reports that ""Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal and retinyl esters."" It\'s involved in maintaining the immune system, vision, reproduction and communication between cells. ""Vitamin A also supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs.""\n\nVitamin A enters the discussion with COPD because the body uses vitamin A to build and repair lung tissue. Dr. Antonello Punturieri, program director for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/environment at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, says the connection between vitamin A and the lungs starts from the very beginning, while we\'re developing in utero and continues well into adulthood. ""The lungs are still developing until age 25 or 30. This is why teen smoking is so bad,"" he says. Having an adequate vitamin A intake throughout this developmental period is critical to developing and maintaining strong, healthy lungs, he says.\n\nBut if our lungs don\'t have enough vitamin A to build or repair themselves, that could potentially lead to lung infections or chronic diseases of the lungs. A 2003 study in the journal Molecular Aspects of Medicine explains that ""during moderate vitamin-A-deficiency, the incidence for diseases of the respiratory tract is considerably increased and repeated respiratory infections can be influenced therapeutically by a moderate vitamin-A-supplementation. In addition to the importance of the vitamin for the lung function, vitamin-A is also responsible for the development of many tissues and cells as well as for the embryonic lung development.""\n\nAnother study conducted in Nepal and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 also found that pregnant women who\'d taken vitamin A supplements during pregnancy had children with better lung health when the researchers followed up 9 to 13 years later. ""Early interventions involving vitamin A supplementation in communities where undernutrition is highly prevalent may have long-lasting consequences for lung health,"" the authors concluded.\n\nSo it seems clear that vitamin A plays a role in lung health. To further investigate this connection, researchers in Holland bred laboratory mice to have reduced, but not deficient, levels of vitamin A. In their 2011 study, published in the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, the researchers then exposed these mice to cigarette smoke and observed that the mice developed emphysema in just three months. Although the study was done in mice and human physiology is different, there could be some implications here for the interaction of cigarette smoke, vitamin A levels and the development of chronic lung diseases.\n\nOne of these hoped-for implications is a way to reverse or cure the lung damage that results in COPD. Way back in 1997, researchers at the Georgetown University School of Medicine showed that retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, reversed emphysema in the lungs of lab rats. The treatment restored lung alveoli – the small air sacs in the lungs that move oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the blood – to normal size and number. These spaces tend to become overinflated in patients with emphysema, so the results of that particular study were encouraging in advancing the idea of using vitamin A as a possible treatment for emphysema and COPD. But in a press release from the NHLBI, study co-author Dr. Donald Massaro urged caution. ""A great deal more basic research is needed before we can even begin to think about applying this to humans. Until then, we caution that there is absolutely no evidence that Vitamin A supplementation is useful in treating lung disorders."" Investigations continue, but currently there\'s still not enough evidence to support the idea that supplementing your diet with vitamin A is going to have a big impact on COPD symptoms or the progression of the disease.\n\nStill, it\'s an important micronutrient that you should seek to include in your diet. Although most Americans are not deficient in vitamin A – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that less than 1 percent of the population is deficient in vitamin A – the Mayo Clinic currently recommends that adult men 18 years and older should seek to take in 900 micrograms (3,000 international units) of vitamin A daily. Women age 18 and older should aim for 700 micrograms (2,300 IU) daily. Pregnant and nursing woman may need more vitamin A.\n\nVitamin A can be found in most multivitamins and in dairy products, liver, fortified foods, fish and darkly colored fruits and vegetables. ""Five servings of fruits and vegetables daily supplies 5 to 6 milligrams of provitamin A carotenoids, which provides about 50 to 65 percent of the adult recommend dietary allowance for vitamin A,"" the Mayo Clinic reports.']","The headline specifically targets people with COPD who are likely to be searching for treatment information, whereas the text itself fails to make the case that there is relevant news for these patients.","The headline of this story asks, “Can vitamin A help with my COPD?” — which suggests that there might be good reason to think that popping a supplement or eating a lot of vitamin A-rich foods would be helpful for those with this condition (more formally known as “chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder”).
However, readers who make it to the end of the story eventually learn that there’s little if any scientific backing for this idea. It seems that vitamin A performs a lot of great functions in the body that make for healthy lungs (and other organs), and that low levels of vitamin A might contribute to the development of COPD in mice who are exposed to cigarette smoke. But according to the story, the only study that comes close to suggesting a treatment benefit for vitamin A on COPD was conducted in mice studied some 20 years ago. So why is a news magazine exploring this topic now? It’s not clear.

Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.\n\nAD\n\nThe disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.\n\nAD\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was “a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.” The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.\n\nGottlieb noted that the action was “not an approval of marijuana or all of its components” but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.\n\nAD\n\nThe agency, he added, remains concerned about “the proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.”\n\nIn April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.\n\nThe FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances — meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.\n\nFor those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, “a recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,” Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”\n\nThe medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy. Shinnar said he will welcome approval of a medicine that had undergone stringent FDA review for safety and effectiveness.\n\nMany parents already are giving children unregulated CBD formulations that are available in medical marijuana dispensaries in the many states where such operations are legal. Some have said that they have no intention of switching to the new prescription CBD drug because the products they're using are helping their children. Others said they are anxious to try an FDA-approved product.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]","The FDA has come under increasing criticism for approving risky drugs without much evidence they work, making it vital that journalists scrutinize approvals.","This Washington Post article announces approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the first drug made directly from a compound found naturally in marijuana plants. It is meant to treat rare, genetic forms of severe childhood epilepsy, and the article goes to some lengths to make clear the FDA’s view that the approval does not constitute government support for marijuana in general, or for the growing commercial availability for self-prescribed medicinal use by the public.
The news story further emphasizes that the marijuana compound — CBD — contains too little of the psychoactive part of the plant, THC, to cause the “high” associated with recreational use.
The story would have been strengthened had it included a discussion about the evidence on which the FDA based its approval. It also doesn’t address the cost of the drug or the diverse and sometimes severe side effects identified in a substantial number of patients who participated in clinical trials, which also are not mentioned.

I would hate to see those advantages lost,” says the lead author Dennis Black, a University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist who led the clinical trials for two bisphosphonates, Fosamax and Reclast, and continues to consult for companies that make osteoporosis drugs.\n\nDennis Black, a University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist who led the clinical trials for two bisphosphonates used to treat osteoporosis. Photo: Aldric Chau\n\nRelated Reading A Support Group of Women\n\n“Bisphosphonates are absolutely effective,” says Timothy Bhattacharyya, an orthopedic trauma surgeon and head of osteoporosis research at the National Institutes of Health. But Dr. Bhattacharyya, who doesn’t receive financial support from osteoporosis drug makers, says “it makes sense to wait until you have a diagnosis of osteoporosis, and not take the drugs for more than five years.”\n\nSome critics say the new analysis overestimates the benefits and underestimate the number of sudden thigh-bone fractures, which can be coded as regular hip fractures in medical records.\n\nOsteoporosis occurs when bone, which is constantly being replenished, breaks down faster than it gets replaced, leaving the skeleton porous and brittle. Each year in the U.S., osteoporosis causes some 700,000 spinal fractures and 300,000 hip fractures, a leading cause of nursing-home admissions. Women, who lose bone rapidly at menopause, are far more susceptible than men. An estimated 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 will suffer an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime.\n\nBisphosonates slow the breakdown and resorption of bone. But who to treat and for how long has been contentious for years—particularly as word of the unusual fractures has spread.\n\nThe incidence of hip fractures has dropped by about 30% since 1995 when Fosamax, the first bisphosphonate, went on sale in the U.S. But curiously, the decline in hip fractures has continued, even with fewer Americans taking the drugs in recent years.\n\nThere are many possible explanations: fewer Americans are smoking (which hastens bone loss); more are exercising (which helps build bone) and more are obese (which helps guard against fractures. “People have more padding,” Dr. Black says.)\n\nPrescribing patterns have also changed. Many doctors now counsel patients to stop taking bisphosphonates after three to five years and re-evaluate the need. Studies show there may be little added benefit in longer-term use.\n\nAnd many doctors now prescribe the drugs mainly to women who already have osteoporosis rather than the estimated 30 million postmenopausal women with “osteopenia,” or only slightly reduced bone mass, who were targeted in early ad campaigns.\n\n“We’re trying to move away from the word ‘osteopenia.’ It isn’t a disease. It merely tells us that bone density is in the lower part of normal range. There are an awful lot of people who fall into that category who may never get osteoporosis,” says Robert Lindsay, chief of medicine at Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw, N.Y. He has received lecture fees from two osteoporosis drug makers.\n\nMany of the women who suffered sudden thigh fractures were relatively young and had taken bisphosphonates for years for osteopenia.\n\nPat Sullivan, a 62-year-old from Delaware, Ohio, has osteoporosis in her spine. She is trying to consumer more calcium and exercise more to help before going on medication. Here she is hiking in Acadia National Park in July. Photo: Doug Sullivan\n\nJennifer Schneider, a Tucson, Ariz., physician, was 59 years old and had taken bisphosphonates for seven years when her thigh bone suddenly snapped on the subway while visiting New York City in 200.X-rays showed her femur—usually one of the strongest bones in the body—had broken in two just below the hip. Surgeons inserted a titanium rod to hold the bone together, but the fracture was slow to heal and required a second surgery.\n\nIn a published study of 81 cases, Dr. Schneider found that, after the first fracture, 40% of the women suffered a similar break in the other leg within two years, and 35% had delayed healing.\n\nOne theory is that prolonged use of the drugs may slow the turnover of bone too much in some people, leaving it unusually brittle. Estimates of how common these fracture are range from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500 among women who have used bisphosphonates for five years or more.\n\nDr. Schneider, who has formed a support group of fellow fracture sufferers, has testified before the Food and Drug Administration, asking for stronger warnings about the drugs. She also says some doctors are continuing to prescribe bisphosphonates for too long.\n\nAnother severe side effect, osteonecrosis of the jaw, in which sections of jaw bone deteriorate after dental work and don’t heal, is estimated to occur in less than 1 per 10,000 patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis.\n\nSome dentists now suggest that women contemplating invasive dental work have it done before they start taking bisphosphonates, but the American Dental Association has not made a formal recommendation.\n\nMakers of bisphosphonates say there is no definitive proof that bisphosphonates cause either atypical femur fractures or jaw bone deterioration.\n\nFor its part, the FDA has told doctors and patients to be aware of the potential for typical femur fractures and jaw problems and urged caution about long-term use of the drugs, but has not issued specific recommendations about when to stop or for how long.\n\nStill, consensus is emerging among researchers and bone experts on other points.\n\nWomen should have a baseline bone density scan at least by age 65, and earlier if they have a strong family history of osteoporosis and other risk factors. A score of minus 2.5 indicates osteoporosis, but treatment should not be based on that alone, doctors now say.\n\nAn online tool, known as FRAX, for Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, developed by the World Health Organization, takes into account other factors such as a patient’s age, gender, weight, height, smoking, alcohol consumption and parental hip fractures. It computes the chances of suffering a major bone fracture in the next 10 years. The National Osteoporosis Foundation says if the risk is more than 3% for a hip fracture or 20% for other major fractures, the advantages of treatment outweigh the risks.\n\nBisphosphonates are still the first line of treatment for osteoporosis. Other osteoporosis drugs have different trade-offs.\n\nAll the bisphosphonates are now available in generic form, for as little as $5 a month. Newer osteoporosis drugs retailing for hundreds of dollars or more a month include Forteo (teriparatide) and Prolia (denosumab).\n\nDoctors continue to recommend 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium, 600 to 800 IUs of vitamin D and at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise, three times a week. Whether that alone is sufficient to prevent osteoporosis in some patients isn’t clear, but some think it’s the safest course.\n\nPat Sullivan, a 62-year old retired teacher in Delaware, Ohio, was told she had osteopenia six years ago. Increasing her calcium and vitamin D intake and exercising more, she was able to improve her bone-density score temporarily. Then, she began to be less diligent and another bone scan two months ago showed full osteoporosis in her spine.\n\nHer doctor wants her to begin treatment—two years of Forteo to stimulate bone growth, then twice-yearly injections of Prolia, to prevent losing that new bone. But Mrs. Sullivan is worried about possible side effects and plans to see if she can build her bone back naturally instead. “By next year, if my score hasn’t improved, I’ll seriously look into the medicine,” she says.\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com']",In-depth reporting on an important issue that covers almost all the angles solidly.

Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.\n\n""For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,"" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol, he noted.\n\nThe reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.\n\nIn the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nAmong these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.\n\nThe researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.\n\nSpecifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.\n\nWhen they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a ""highly significant"" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.\n\nTaking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.\n\nIn addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.\n\nThe second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.\n\nThis trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.\n\nThe study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).\n\nOver almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.\n\nThe reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.\n\nThe researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.\n\nResearchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.\n\nResearchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an ""underestimate.""\n\nBaigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. ""There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,"" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)\n\nBernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that ""people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.""\n\nTheir doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.\n\n""If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,"" Cheung said.\n\n""If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,"" he said. ""But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,"" he added.\n\nCommenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that ""despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.""\n\nLowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.\n\n""Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,"" Fonarow said. ""Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.""\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.']","Given how many people take statins in the US and how heavily marketed they are to everyone else, we think this story — and others — needed to take a more critical look at the evidence behind the claims that statins can significantly reduce strokes and heart attacks.","This is a story on the results of two recently published studies that found that more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels was associated with greater reductions in future risk of cardiac outcomes. While there was good information about the sorts of outcomes that were reduced in the group using the increased dose of the statins, there was not a thorough analysis of the evidence. On the plus side, the story did mention that cancer outcomes were not affected by the change in cardiovascular events, and the story did include information about the harms associated with statin medication. The story also, however, had a few modest errors. It said, for example, “The reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.” We think they meant not statistically significant. Elsewhere, the story says, “Researchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal — a possible indicator of kidney damage.” Creatine kinase (CK) is an indicator of muscle damage. It is not in and of itself a measure of kidney damage (which would be measured with serum creatinine). Of course, more muscle damage makes kidney damage more likely, but that is slightly different than what was written.

Nutrition lab\n\nAnyone looking for an easy way to boost brain power is likely to come across an increasingly common piece of advice: Up your intake of B vitamins.\n\nForgot where you left your keys? The name of your neighbor\'s kid? Whether you locked the car?\n\nThe vitamins — including folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 — are often touted as a way to improve memory and stave off cognitive decline. The claims are based on the finding that levels of the vitamin are low in people with various forms of cognitive impairment, including dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nBut experts say it\'s still unclear whether taking high doses of the vitamins will keep such conditions at bay.\n\n""I don\'t know that people need to rush out and buy B vitamins — I don\'t think we\'re ready [for that] yet,"" says Mary Haan, an epidemiology professor at UC San Francisco who has studied the relationship between B vitamin intake and cognitive function in elderly adults.\n\nResearchers believe B vitamins may affect brain health because of their ability to lower blood levels of an amino acid called homocysteine. In the 1990s, several studies documented high levels of homocysteine in people with cognitive impairment and dementia. But at the time, scientists didn\'t know whether high levels of the amino acid caused cognitive decline or whether cognitive decline caused people to accumulate high levels of the amino acid.\n\nTo determine which came first, researchers at Boston University followed approximately 1,100 healthy adults who were enrolled in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 to identify risk factors for heart disease. At the end of eight years, the researchers found that the rates of dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease were higher in people who had had high homocysteine levels compared with those who had low levels. Their conclusions — that high homocysteine levels increase a person\'s risk of dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease — were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002.\n\nSince then, a handful of studies have administered high doses of homocysteine-lowering B vitamins to subjects in order to determine the vitamins\' effects on brain function. The results have so far been mixed, with only a minority of studies showing a benefit, says Joshua Miller, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis who studies the vitamins.']","We wish more claims of simple cures were the subject of stories this thoughtful and cautious. It didn’t hit all of our marks, but it performed an excellent service for readers wondering whether upping their B vitamin intake could help them stop memory loss.","This story provided insightful information about whether there exists an associations between the intake of specific  B vitamins, including B6, folic acid (B9), and B12 (cobalamin), and chance of developing dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, this story is a very well organized discussion about what is and is not known about these vitamins, the levels of the amino acid homocysteine, and age-related or disease related cognitive impairment.  The story never explained why this information was being reported at the current time, but it did provide a well considered look at the research on a complicated topic.

[Brown University] -- To the tantalizing delight of chocolate lovers everywhere, a number of recent studies employing various methods have suggested that compounds in cocoa called flavanols could benefit cardiovascular health. Now a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cocoa consumption reveals some further pieces of supporting evidence.\n\nThe meta-analysis in the Journal of Nutrition, an assessment of the combined evidence from all 19 RCTs, focused on whether consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa products was associated with improvements in specific circulating biomarkers of cardiometabolic health as compared to consuming placebos with negligible cocoa flavanol content. In all, 1,139 volunteers were involved in these trials.\n\n""Our meta-analysis of RCTs characterizes how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic biomarkers, providing guidance in designing large, definitive prevention trials against diabetes and cardiovascular disease in future work,"" said corresponding author Dr. Simin Liu, professor and director of the Center for Global Cardiometabolic Health at Brown University who worked with epidemiology graduate student and lead author Xiaochen Lin. ""We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides), insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.""\n\nLiu noted some limitations in the trials. All studies were small and of short duration, not all of the biomarkers tracked in these studies changed for the better, and none of the studies were designed to test directly whether cocoa flavanol consumption leads to reduced cases of heart attacks or type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut taking into account some of these heterogeneities across studies, the team\'s meta-analysis summarizing data from 19 trials found potential beneficial effects of flavanol-rich cocoa on cardiometabolic health. There were small-to-modest but statistically significant improvements among those who ate flavanol-rich cocoa product vs. those who did not.\n\nThe greatest effects were seen among trial volunteers who ate between 200 and 600 milligrams of flavanols a day (based on their cocoa consumption). They saw significant declines in blood glucose and insulin, as well as another indicator of insulin resistance called HOMA-IR. They also saw an increase in HDL, or ""good,"" cholesterol. Those consuming higher doses saw some of the insulin resistance benefits and a drop in triglycerides, but not a significant increase in HDL. Those with lower doses of flavanols only saw a significant HDL benefit.\n\nIn general, Lin said, where there were benefits they were evident for both women and men and didn\'t depend on what physical form the flavanol-rich cocoa product was consumed in --dark chocolate vs. a beverage, for example.\n\n""The treatment groups of the trials included in our meta-analysis are primarily dark chocolate -- a few were using cocoa powder-based beverages,"" Lin said. ""Therefore, the findings from the current study apparently shouldn\'t be generalized to different sorts of chocolate candies or white chocolates, of which the content of sugar/food additives could be substantially higher than that of the dark chocolate.""\n\nThe authors therefore concluded, ""Our study highlights the urgent need for large, long-term RCTs that improve our understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into clinical outcomes.""\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Lin and Liu, the study\'s other authors are Isabel Zhang, Alina Li from Brown University, JoAnn Manson, Howard Sesso and Lu Wang from Brigham and Women\'s Hospital.\n\nThe authors acknowledge funding from the National Institutes of Health including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the American Heart Association, and Pfizer. Co-authors at Brigham and Women\'s also noted receiving funding from Mars Symbioscience, a research segment of Mars, Inc., which makes chocolate products.']","This overview of a study, that was itself an overview, lacks details that would allow readers to know whether another chocolate-focused story was warranted.","There have been so many stories about the possible health benefits of cocoa flavanol-derived chocolate over the years and so many studies purporting to document these benefits that it is useful to have a meta-analysis of the available clinical trial evidence. This release is based on a review of 19 randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of cocoa flavanols on biomarkers of heart health.
We expected to see a lot of good data in this release but found very little. Instead we found strong statements about the findings being “significant” or about how the “benefits they were evident for both women and men.” There were a few caveats sprinkled in too, helpfully. The study authors are quoted saying the review and meta-analysis point to the need for larger, longer clinical trials to judge whether these changes in biomarkers translate into actual improved outcomes for people. And there was an acknowledgment that some of the funding for the work came from one of the world’s biggest chocolate makers.

EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) – An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.\n\n“This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,” said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.\n\nThe stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.\n\nWhen animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.\n\nCedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.\n\n“These induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,” said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. “Though additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.”\n\nNext steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug. From there, clinical trials will be designed to test potential benefit in patients with later-stage age-related macular degeneration.\n\nAdditional Cedars-Sinai authors include Dhruv Sareen, PhD; Yuchun Tsai, PhD; Bin Lu, MD, PhD; Benjamin Bakondi, PhD; Sergey Girman, PhD; and Anais Sahabian, PhD.\n\nThis work was supported by the Simon and Beathrice Apple Stem Cell Fund for Eye Research, the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory; National Institutes of Health (R01 EY020488), Department of Defense (W81XWH-12-1-0617), Foundation Fighting Blindness and the Knights Templar Eye Foundation Inc.\n\nCitation: STEM CELLS. 2015 April: Human iPSC-derived neural progenitors preserve vision in an AMD-like model.']",This news release makes a huge leap from rat research to claiming that “our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.”,"While the findings described in this news release are enticing and hopeful, they were derived from animal studies, not human clinical trials.  While the release eventually explains that, it went on to make crystal ball projections of being “close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.”
Research efforts to manipulate pluripotent stem cells for use in various disorders, including retinal degeneration, are widespread and some forms of stem cell therapy using cells derived from embryonic stem cells, for instance, are already in human trials. The novel source of cells for this rat study is important, but this research does not stand alone. Even a little bit of context would have helped.

It requires refrigeration, which means ambulances can\'t stock it and medics can\'t administer it on the battlefield. It goes bad after 42 days. Donor blood must be compatible with the patient\'s blood type. And some people refuse transfusions — Jehovah\'s Witnesses, for instance, believe the Bible forbids them.\n\n\n\nAlthough the U.S. blood supply is fairly safe and steady, that\'s not the case everywhere. In sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization estimates that 44% of women who die in childbirth succumb to blood loss. The WHO also reports that in 41 countries, some blood isn\'t screened for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis, putting recipients at risk of developing serious infections.\n\n\n\n""We definitely need a blood substitute out there,"" says Dr. Ernest Moore, a trauma surgeon at the University of Colorado\'s Denver Health Medical Center.\n\n\n\nBlood is, as they say, thicker than water. Nearly half of the liquid is made up of red blood cells, which pick up oxygen in the lungs and deliver it to the rest of the body. The fluid also contains white blood cells, which patrol the body to fight infection, and platelets, which form clots to make wounds stop bleeding. In addition, there are numerous proteins and chemicals that regulate blood pressure, transport nutrients and perform many other vital functions.\n\n\n\nScientists agree that creating a fluid capable of performing all of these tasks is nearly as fantastical as discovering vampires living among us. But several researchers believe they can mimic one key function — the shuttling of oxygen — in a liquid that could help accident victims, injured soldiers and anyone else who requires a transfusion.\n\n\n\nSynthetic oxygen carriers come in two main flavors. One is based on natural red blood cells, while another is entirely artificial.\n\n\n\nRed blood cells are basically little dimpled bags full of hemoglobin, the molecule that collects and releases oxygen. So researchers have attempted to build oxygen carriers out of hemoglobin itself.\n\n\n\n""It\'s a natural means for delivering oxygen,"" says Arthur Bollon, a molecular geneticist who serves on the board of HemoBioTech Inc., a biotech firm in Dallas.\n\n\n\nBut outside its little bag, pure hemoglobin is toxic. It tightens blood vessels, leading to high blood pressure and heart attacks. It also causes inflammation, including swelling and fevers.\n\n\n\nThose problems have forced scientists to alter it for medical use. But many of their attempts have failed to meet rigid safety standards.\n\n\n\nMoore led a clinical trial of a hemoglobin substitute called PolyHeme that was given to 349 accident victims en route to the hospital and during the first 12 hours of treatment. Compared with a control group of 364 patients who received saline solution followed by donated blood, those treated with PolyHeme were slightly more likely to suffer multiple organ failure and other adverse effects, such as high blood pressure and inflammation. However, they were just as likely to be alive 30 days later, according to results published last year in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.\n\n\n\n""Those of us who used PolyHeme in critically injured patients saw patients survive with this product,"" Moore says. ""It works.""\n\n\n\nBut 3% of the people treated with PolyHeme had heart attacks — three times as many as in the control group — and the Food and Drug Administration concluded that all hemoglobin-based carriers are dangerous. Northfield Laboratories, the Evanston, Ill., company that made the product, shut down last year, as have many artificial oxygen carrier companies.\n\n\n\nStill, HemoBioTech has not given up. The firm is attempting to improve on the formula with a product called HemoTech that uses hemoglobin from cows hooked to a molecule called adenosine. Adenosine happens to be anti-inflammatory and causes blood vessels to widen, so it counters the side effects of pure hemoglobin. Moreover, HemoTech signals the body to produce more of its own red blood cells, Bollon says.\n\n\n\nSangart Inc. in San Diego is using a similar approach. Its MP4OX is a combination of hemoglobin from expired human blood — hemoglobin lasts longer than other components — plus additional chemicals to reduce side effects. It\'s intended to work as a supplement to help a patient\'s blood carry oxygen, says Sangart President Brian O\'Callaghan.\n\n\n\nMore than 500 people have been treated with MP4OX in clinical trials. In one recent study, which has not yet been published, doctors examined 51 trauma patients who received standard treatment with or without MP4OX. The hemoglobin substitute appeared to do a better job of delivering oxygen, and there were no worrisome side effects, O\'Callaghan says. An earlier study, published in the journal Haematologica in 2005, found that eight volunteers who received MP4OX had no more side effects than a control group that received saline.\n\n\n\nThe 100% man-made blood substitutes are based on chemicals called perfluorocarbons, or PFCs. They can stand in for red blood cells because they dissolve oxygen, just as water dissolves sugar. Then they can carry oxygen as they flow throughout the body.\n\n\n\nThe chemicals travel through the blood as tiny droplets that absorb oxygen in the lungs and drop it off in the tissues. The more oxygen available the better, so recipients often breathe oxygen-rich air from a tank as part of their treatment.\n\n\n\nSanguine Corp. in Pasadena is attempting to use PFCs as artificial oxygen carriers. PFCs don\'t naturally intermingle with water, so scientists at Sanguine mix up an emulsion — rather like making an oil-and-vinegar salad dressing — called PHER-O2.\n\n\n\n""It looks like skim milk,"" says pharmaceutical scientist Thomas Dress, Sanguine\'s chief executive.\n\n\n\nThe PFC system isn\'t perfect; breathing in too much oxygen can prompt the release of dangerous free radicals, which can damage cells throughout the body.\n\n\n\nAnd PFCs, due to their milky appearance, can interfere with blood tests that are meant to work with the red stuff, says Dr. Ross Herron, chief medical officer of the Western Division of the American Red Cross in Pomona.\n\n\n\nEven if scientists ultimately succeed in creating workable and safe blood substitutes, they are unlikely to stand in for the real thing except in special circumstances, such as accidents. None of the products currently in development survives in the body for longer than a few days; a real blood transfusion, on the other hand, lasts for months.\n\n\n\nStill, some scientists remain optimistic that someday every ambulance and field medic will pack a supply of artificial oxygen carriers.\n\n\n\n""This is going to be the single biggest drug in the history of medicine,"" Drees says. ""It\'s going to save a lot of lives.""\n\n\n\nhealth@latimes.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This wonderfully written piece serves as both a profile of one of the most important components of our bodies — blood — and a glimpse into the future of what blood transfusions may become.</span>","It does not delve as deeply into the evidence behind some of these blood substitutes as we would have liked.

Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,"" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.\n\nPort noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.\n\n""But isn\'t there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it\'s safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,"" she said.\n\nPort\'s study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.\n\nThe women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.\n\nWomen in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.\n\nPort also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the ""never had a mammogram"" group.\n\nHowever, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.\n\nAnd Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.\n\nStill, ""the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required. But this study doesn\'t tell us about long-term outcomes or what transpired over a long period of time,"" he said.\n\nAlso, because of the nature of the study and the small sample size in the young age group sub-analysis, Lichtenfeld said that ""this cannot be interpreted as a study telling us what age to start mammograms.""\n\nThe study is to be presented Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about mammography screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society.']",But the story would have been stronger had it described the findings using absolute rather than relative numbers.,"This HealthDay news story reports on findings among women diagnosed with breast cancer: those who had longer intervals between mammograms end up getting more aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy and surgery.

1366,story_reviews_00875,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/mixed-message-on-antidepressant-for-hot-flashes/,2012-04-23 04:00:00,Mixed message on antidepressant for hot flashes,"['NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - New findings suggest that the antidepressant Lexapro might make hot flashes a little less of a nuisance to women — adding to the mixed bag of results regarding that drug’s effect on menopause symptoms.\n\nThe study, of 205 women, found that those randomly assigned to take Lexapro (escitalopram) for eight weeks reported less daily “interference” from their hot flashes.\n\nCompared with women given inactive placebo pills, they said hot flashes were taking less of a toll on their work, daily activities, sleep and general mood. Women on the placebo also improved over time, however.\n\nThe findings come from the same clinical trial that, last year, showed Lexapro halved the number of hot flashes women had each day. (See Reuters story of January 18, 2011.)\n\nA separate study a few months later showed no such benefit, however. In two trials of 36 women, researchers found that Lexapro did not cut the number or severity of hot flashes over eight weeks. (See Reuters Health story of May 26, 2011.)\n\nAnd the lead researcher on that study said these latest findings are “nothing to write home about.”\n\n“The differences between the treatment and placebo groups are very small,” said Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit.\n\nIn general, studies of hot-flash remedies over the years have “virtually always found a large placebo effect,” Freedman noted in an interview.\n\nThat could mean that study participants’ hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do.\n\n“But my feeling is that it’s the placebo effect,” Freedman said, referring to the phenomenon of study participants on placebos improving because they believe they are getting a real treatment.\n\nHot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.\n\nTheir exact cause is unknown, but hormonal regulation of body temperature is thought to be involved.\n\nBouts of hot flashes can happen many times a day and past research has found they can continue for anywhere from a few months to up to 10 years.\n\nSo far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\nAnd right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.\n\nBut women and doctors are wary of HRT these days — since a 2002 clinical trial linked the hormones to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots.\n\nSo researchers have been looking for alternatives. And studies have suggested that a few antidepressants, used at low doses, can be helpful for some women — including paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and venlafaxine (Effexor).\n\nThis latest study, reported in the journal Fertility & Sterility, focused on hot flash “interference” — the degree to which women feel hot flashes disrupt their lives.\n\nThat’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis.\n\nThe trial included 205 women who were having at least 28 bouts of hot flashes or “night sweats” a week. Carpenter’s team randomly assigned half to use Lexapro for eight weeks, while the other half were given placebo pills.\n\nThe women kept diaries to record their hot flash symptoms. And every four weeks, they filled out a questionnaire on hot-flash interference.\n\nAfter four weeks, the study found, women on the antidepressant saw their score on the interference scale fall by half, on average. It remained there at week eight.\n\nBut women in the placebo group also improved, albeit more slowly and to a somewhat lesser degree.\n\nIn a separate analysis of the same study group, Carpenter’s team found that women on Lexapro also reported bigger improvements in sleep problems: half saw their insomnia symptoms drop by at least 50 percent, versus 35 percent of placebo users.\n\nThose findings appear in a separate report in the journal Menopause.\n\nFreedman said that the overall research on antidepressants and hot flashes is still inconsistent. “Overall, the picture is not optimistic.”\n\nIn his own study last year, Freedman used a different approach to measuring hot flashes: instead of asking women to record their symptoms in a diary, the researchers had them wear a “detector” to monitor objective measures of hot flashes.\n\n“I trust the objective measure more,” Freedman said.\n\nIt is possible for women’s hot flashes to remain unchanged objectively, but have their subjective experience of them change. “But that raises the question of why,” Freedman said.\n\nAnd for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.\n\nLexapro, which costs about $125 a month, belongs to the group of antidepressants called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They increase levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which may have a role in regulating body heat.\n\nBut no one knows if altering serotonin levels actually does affect women’s hot flashes. In fact, Freedman said, there’s some evidence that lowering serotonin levels does not worsen hot flashes — which would be expected if the “serotonin theory” is correct.\n\nAntidepressants can also have side effects, like nausea, drowsiness, headache, constipation and dry mouth.\n\nRight now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes. But in the U.S., doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs “off-label” for conditions other than their approved uses.\n\nBesides antidepressants, doctors sometimes prescribe certain blood pressure medications or the anti-seizure drug gabapentin, which some studies suggest may be helpful.\n\nHot flashes often need no drug treatment at all, though.\n\nIf they are not severe, experts say simple steps can be enough — like avoiding hot and spicy foods, turning down the thermostat, or trying relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation.\n\nThere are several herbal or “natural” products marketed for easing menopause symptoms, including black cohosh, soy, red clover and dong quai. But there is little evidence that they work, according to the North American Menopause Society.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/J54Hwj Fertility & Sterility, online April 4, 2012, and Menopause, online March 19, 2012.']",Well balanced piece about whether antidepressants are really effective in treating hot flashes in menopausal women.,"This article presents the results of several studies examining whether antidepressants are effective in reducing hot flashes in menopausal women.  The article avoids overstating the results of these studies and provides information from skeptics that many of these results could be the result of the placebo effect and have nothing to do with treatment.

But a single case study that uses an experimental immunotherapy to treat these brain tumors might give oncologists a new way to approach the disease.\n\nThe therapy, called CAR-T, is controversial and has faced hurdles in clinical trials. It has shown great promise in treating blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma — but has proven challenging in treating other forms of the disease, including solid tumors.']","When reporting on a single case study, journalists should use abundant caution to avoid overselling the research.","This story in STAT, like the one in TIME.com that we also reviewed, describes the successful, and apparently first positive response of a glioblastoma brain tumor to CAR-T therapy. This is an experimental immunotherapy that depends on on injections of modified immune cell proteins and that has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain.
Described in a report in the The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has a somewhat unfortunate history of touting treatments as bringing about “miracles” and encouraging coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment.
This STAT story does a better job than TIME of putting what is essentially a single, unexpected experimental result into perspective. Its strongest points are that it avoids touting this one patient’s experience as any kind of broad “success,” calling it an “early inroad;’ emphasizing its “notorious” potential side effects; and most of all quoting sources outside City of Hope who made clear that, as one put it, the success was possibly a “flash in the pan.” Bravo. One thing that would have made the story stronger? Early on emphasizing how a single case study makes for weak evidence. See our six tips for writing accurately about cancer immunotherapy drugs.

We encourage people to choose the best option for them, in consultation with their clinician,"" former Task Force member Dr. Douglas Owens said Wednesday in a USPSTF news release.\n\nThe panel\'s reticence to choose one option over another may be at odds with the preference of many doctors, who often advise colonoscopy as the ""gold standard"" test.\n\nDr. Arun Swaminath is one of them.\n\n""There is only one test -- colonoscopy -- that can both diagnose a polyp/cancer and remove or sample it at the same time,"" said Swaminath, who directs the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\n""This is key, because a positive stool test plus stool DNA test (such as Cologuard), or a positive imaging test (such as CT colonoscopy) will still require a follow up colonoscopy to confirm and treat the problem,"" he explained.\n\nFor its part, the American Cancer Society recommends colonoscopy screening once every 10 years, beginning at age 50, or one of a number of other tests at more frequent intervals.\n\nIn drafting its updated colon cancer screening guidelines, the USPSTF reviewed data on several screening strategies. Besides colonoscopy, these included flexible sigmoidoscopy (an invasive procedure that penetrates less far than colonoscopy); CT colonography (a scan of the colon); traditional fecal occult blood tests (looking for blood in stool); and the recently approved Cologuard DNA-based stool test.\n\nThe panel said there were no comparison studies that suggested that any of the screening methods were any more effective than others. There are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations, the panelists said.\n\nAnd what about colon cancer screening for the elderly?\n\nIn its statement, the panel said that ""for some adults ages 76 to 85, the benefits of screening are smaller, and the potential for harm greater. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found.""\n\nFor this older group, the USPSTF recommends that decisions on screening be made during consultations between the patient and his or her doctor.\n\nAll of the recommendations are specific to symptom-free people 50 years of age or older with an average risk colorectal cancer, the panel stressed. People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said.\n\nThe updated recommendation was published online June 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n""Evidence convincingly shows screening for colorectal cancer works, but not enough people are taking advantage of this highly effective service,"" said Owens, a general internist at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System and a professor at Stanford University.\n\nThe USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.\n\nColorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This year about 134,000 people in the country will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it., the panel said\n\nThe USPSTF is an independent, volunteer panel of experts that makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific preventive health services.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on colon cancer screening.']",HealthDay’s take on the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force’s colon cancer screening news last week would have been stronger if it had delved into specifics such as costs and risks.,"This story about updated colon cancer screening recommendations offers readers a reasonably faithful summary of the key conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The key point of the new guidelines is that several methods of screening all work pretty well for people ages 50-to-75, yet many Americans don’t get screened.
Unfortunately, the article doesn’t do much to inform the reader beyond the task force’s news release (available for download here), only stating that “there are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations.”
While it may be cumbersome to explain those benefits and risks in detail, it still would have been useful to go over some of the specifics, such as risks and costs, so that people get a basic idea of some of the complex trade-offs at hand.

Their cancer grows exponentially after getting a checkpoint drug.\n\n""We\'re going to have to figure out not only who to treat with immunotherapy but who not to treat,"" Kurzrock said.\n\nGene tests are starting to help sort that out. But for patients, the big question is ""Will it work for me?""\n\nPREDICTING WHO BENEFITS\n\nThe first step is testing for a protein called PD-L1 that\'s often involved in forming that chemical cloak. Some checkpoint drugs target this or a related protein, so people with a lot of it should respond to treatment.\n\nThat was the hope when Diane Tippett showed up last October at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center with a salivary gland cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs.\n\n""Five years ago, I probably would have thrown up my hands and given her standard chemo,"" said the center\'s director, Dr. Louis Weiner.\n\nInstead, he ordered tests that showed Tippett had a PD-L1 mutation, meaning her cancer made a lot of it. He started the 49-year-old Leonardtown, Maryland, woman on a checkpoint drug, Opdivo, and told her to come back in a few months.\n\n""Quite honestly, I didn\'t know if I\'d ever see her again,"" he said.\n\nNow, Tippett\'s lung tumors are gone. Her liver tumor shrank 50 percent and is stable. She got married in July and says she feels great.\n\n""I don\'t feel any different than you do. I\'m not tired, I\'ve got all my hair,"" she said. ""I want more people to know about it and to ask their doctors about it,"" she said of immunotherapy and the testing that led her to it.\n\nNOT THE WHOLE STORY\n\nThat protein isn\'t a very reliable predictor, though. Some people with a lot of it don\'t benefit from the drugs and the opposite also is true. There are other checkpoints besides that one, too.\n\nResearchers increasingly are focusing on something else Tippett had: a high number of flawed genes. It\'s a sign that tumors have been evolving over time and are hard to treat with drugs that target a single gene. It sometimes accompanies two other DNA problems that some checkpoint drugs already are approved to treat.\n\nLyon, the San Diego man, had nearly two dozen different mutations after his skin cancer spread widely. In October 2015, he started on Opdivo and was in near-complete remission within two months. Recent tests showed no active cancer in his spine and lungs, and doctors think small spots in his brain and liver may be scar tissue, though they can\'t know for sure. A test for tumor DNA in his blood found none.\n\n""It would appear my cancer is all dead,"" he said, and called it ""nothing short of miraculous"" that gene tests led to successful treatment after years of trial and error. ""I\'m so grateful. No one\'s lucky that gets cancer but I may be in an era where there\'s a way through this tunnel.""\n\nThree-quarters of patients who are helped by checkpoint drugs have long-lasting benefits, as Lyon did, said Dr. Steven O\'Day, an immunotherapy expert at Providence Saint John\'s Health Center in Santa Monica, California.\n\n""When you respond, it\'s a home run in terms of long-term survival,"" O\'Day said. ""But we still have to be better at predicting who those patients are.""\n\nTHE DARK SIDE\n\nOthers have not been so fortunate. In November, French researchers reported that 12 of 131 patients, or 9 percent, got much worse after checkpoint drugs, which seemed to speed their tumor growth.\n\nKurzrock checked with colleagues and quickly found more cases — a 73-year-old man with bladder cancer, a 65-year-old woman with endometrial cancer, and a 44-year-old breast cancer patient whose tumors ""just exploded"" in size within two months of immunotherapy.\n\nIn a report on 155 patients, she tied several gene mutations to this risk. Kurzrock has consulted for some gene-medicine makers and co-founded a company using a software program to determine best treatments for patients depending on their tumor genes.\n\nThe unfortunate cases are a reality check, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\n\n""We are not paying close enough attention to those people"" and need to know whether they fared badly because of their treatment or for other reasons, he said.\n\nSHOULD WE BE DOING \'IMMUNOGRAMS\'?\n\nThat\'s the question Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, posed a gene medicine conference he organized in March at the suburban San Diego research center. Should there be baseline tests to map what patients\' natural defenses look like? For example, how many immune system soldiers called T cells do they have in the area of the tumor?\n\nMax Krummel is working on a roadmap to do that. The University of California, San Francisco, scientist heads a project with $10 million from three companies that make checkpoint drugs. He is analyzing hundreds of tumor samples to see what immune system features spell success or failure.\n\n""We\'re not looking at how the immune system changes,"" but for what starting point works best with the drugs, he said. ""What we\'re seeing is that the kinds of cells you have in a tumor predict who\'s going to respond.""\n\nKrummel, who was involved in work that led to Yervoy, the first checkpoint drug, has started a company to try to tune up one part of the immune system he thinks is key to maintaining a healthy balance.\n\nCancer exists because the immune system isn\'t working as it should, he said, so successful immunotherapy may require ""treating the immune system, not treating the tumor.""\n\n___\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP\n\n___\n\nThis Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\'s Department of Science Education.

Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don\'t heal the injury within the brain.\n\nCould oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n""These patients don\'t have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,"" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. ""Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.""\n\nBut other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.\n\n""People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can\'t,"" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.\n\nCompressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.\n\nPatients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.\n\nThe nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don\'t die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n""Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,"" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.\n\nPatients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.\n\nResearchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEfrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. ""A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,"" he said, ""they are the same basic thing.""\n\nEfrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital\'s small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn\'t especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn\'t heal — a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet — and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.\n\nAs the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars — the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance — on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs — reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million — of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOverall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can\'t be patented, which limits its potential profitability. ""It\'s very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,"" Harch said.\n\nA few studies besides Cifu\'s have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.\n\nWhile the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZiad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.\n\nOne of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn\'t concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.\n\nOver the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. ""I felt completely hopeless,"" she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt ""perfect."" ""It was a complete 180,"" she said. ""This treatment saved my life.""\n\nCook\'s primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. ""Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn\'t function,"" Pathak said.\n\nBut a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she ""got suddenly and rather miraculously better,"" Pathak said.\n\nOf course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. ""Definitely, we need more science,"" he said. ""We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.""\n\nAD']",Some of the examples of anecdotal experience with the therapy weren’t related to post-concussion syndrome and may confuse readers.,"The story investigates whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy might prove useful in treating post-concussion syndrome — a lingering constellation of symptoms affecting a small minority of those who suffer mildly traumatic brain injuries.
Although the story makes it clear that research to date has been inconclusive, and the potential costs substantial, it could have been more clear about the risks associated with the therapy. Furthermore, some of the examples of anecdotal experience with the therapy weren’t related to post-concussion syndrome and may confuse readers.

BioSure UK has begun selling a $45 take-home HIV test that lets customers prick their fingers, smear the blood on a testing stick, and get their HIV results within 15 minutes.\n\nBioSure’s test goes beyond any of the at-home tests available on the U.S. market, which are either not as fast or not as accurate. When asked if any test similar to BioSure’s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: “The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.”\n\nThe FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. (Users get their results by calling the company.) OraQuick, on the other hand, is an oral-based at-home test that does let users see their results immediately, but it has an 8.3 percent chance of a false negative. (In contrast, BioSure’s blood test has a much lower 0.2 percent chance that a person who is really HIV positive will test negative.)\n\nBoth countries have tried to make it easier to be tested. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.\n\nBut if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.\n\nThe two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.\n\nThat suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. (There is a lag of about three months between initial HIV infection and the point at which it is detectable.)\n\nA sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. In a 2008 study of British men who frequented commercial gay venues, 42 percent of the men who tested positive for HIV had never been diagnosed with HIV. This wasn’t because they had never been screened; 81 percent of the undiagnosed men had been tested for HIV previously. Sixty-two percent of these previously screened men erroneously believed themselves to be HIV-negative.\n\nAdopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. There’s a benefit in regular screening, even for patients who don’t wind up connecting with a doctor.\n\nIn a small British study of 98 gay and bisexual men who were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive, the use of condoms after the diagnosis doubled relative to the rates of use pre-diagnosis (31 percent to 61 percent of respondents). And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.\n\nThe U.K.’s new at-home HIV test won’t reach all the undiagnosed or guarantee that the people who test positive wind up receiving the care they need from a doctor, but letting people check their status quickly and accurately is likely to produce cascading positive effects, as HIV-positive people find it easier to seek care for themselves, warn past partners about exposure, and reduce risk for future partners. America needs to catch up.']",This story about a take-home HIV self test reads a bit too much like an op-ed for our liking. Important caveats and nuance are missing from the coverage.,"This story on an at-home HIV self test now available in Britain ends with “America needs to catch up.” This concluding opinion marks the article as more advocacy than news. Throughout the story, potential benefits are highlighted in a way that’s incomplete and potentially misleading. Harms are also ignored, and evidence is absent or mischaracterized.

That included decreased pain and increased ability to do daily tasks without pain; less fatigue, depression and anxiety; and an overall better quality of life. Patients also reported better sleep quality and improved physical conditioning.\n\nThe improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n""It was incredible,"" said lead study author Dr. Chenchen Wang, an associate professor of medicine in the rheumatology department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. ""You could see them change every week. They became very happy. I felt very, very excited to be with them.""\n\nFibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia and multiple tender points. The syndrome can also cause psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and memory and concentration problems, sometimes called the ""fibromyalgia fog.""\n\nAbout 10 million Americans have fibromyalgia, and about 75 percent to 90 percent of them are women, according to estimates from the National Fibromyalgia Association.\n\nDoctors will often suggest exercise, sleep hygiene techniques and medications to treat the condition, but often with limited success, said Dr. Gloria Yeh, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.\n\nMost patients, according to background information in the article, remain in pain years after the diagnosis, are aerobically unfit, have poor muscle strength and flexibility, and need medications to control symptoms.\n\nWhile larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said.\n\n""This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. Since it is a low-impact, gentle, non-threatening, accessible activity, it may be a perfect exercise for debilitated patients with fibromyalgia who otherwise cannot or choose not to do other forms of exercise,"" Yeh said. ""Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition.""\n\nSo what is it about tai chi that works?\n\nThere\'s no definitive answer to that just yet, Wang said. Tai chi is a mind-body exercise that originated as a martial art in China, utilizing slow, gentle movements to build strength and flexibility, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move qi, or vital energy, throughout the body.\n\nPrior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The controlled breathing and movements may promote ""mental tranquility,"" according to the study, which could help with pain.\n\n""The physical component of tai chi can improve aerobic capacity, strength and muscle function,"" Wang said. ""But in my opinion, the most important part is mental. You see lots of patients improve their depression and become good friends with each other.""\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for the research.\n\nMore information\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine has more on tai chi.']","Overall, not a very reader-friendly or helpful story.  Doesn’t explain how big was the potential benefit seen.  Doesn’t evaluate the quality of the evidence.  Doesn’t compare efficacy with other alternatives. Overstates the prevalence – disease-mongering.  ","This story (one of five we reviewed on this study) summarizes the findings of a recent study into the potential of benefits of tai chi for patients suffering from fibromyalgia.

The retrospective study was led by researchers at Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, University of Arizona, Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Miami, Essentia Health, Stanford University and University of Southern California.\n\n""Research points to this as a pathway to regulate and prevent this most common cause of blindness in adults,"" said Murray Brilliant, Ph.D., director, Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation Center for Human Genetics, Marshfield, Wisconsin. ""Imagine telling patients we potentially have medication that will allow them to see and continue enjoying life, their family and perform every day activities as they age. That is very powerful.""\n\nAMD, the No. 1 cause of legal blindness in adults over 60, is a progressive eye condition affecting as many as one in three adults. The disease attacks the macula of the eye, where the sharpest central vision occurs, causing central blindness. This vision is used to drive, read, recognize faces and perform daily tasks. AMD spares the peripheral vision, leaving dim images or black holes at the center of vision.\n\nL-DOPA is a natural by-product of pigmentation and is made in a layer of cells in the back of the eye that functions to promote health and survival of retinal tissues. Researchers asked the question if people taking L-DOPA as a medicine are protected from AMD.\n\n""The obvious question was if the L-DOPA no longer produced was supplemented via pill form, does it have the potential to serve as a preventive medicine against AMD,"" Brilliant said. ""We need more research, but this first step is promising.""\n\nAlbinism research leads to hope\n\nThis work grew out of research using albino mouse models. Mice, as well as humans who have albinism or lack of pigmentation, have profound vision loss and changes in the eye structure , especially the macula, the oval-shaped area near the center of the retina associated with a person\'s ability to see clearly.\n\nRace and ocular pigmentation are known risk factors for developing AMD, indicating darker pigmentation may protect from the disease as it occurs much, much more frequently in the white population than black or Hispanic populations. This led to the hypothesis that those with darker pigmentation may have greater L-DOPA signaling in the RPE.\n\nTo test this, researchers examined health records of 37,000 Marshfield Clinic patients looking for those with AMD, those taking L-DOPA and those with both L-DOPA and AMD. They then determined the age patients developed AMD.\n\nAccording to national statistics, the average age at which individuals are given L-DOPA is 67; the average age of AMD diagnosis is 71. In those people who got L-DOPA before being diagnosed with AMD, their AMD diagnosis occurred eight years later than those without L-DOPA.\n\nThese provocative results were then confirmed in a much larger data set of 87 million patients where similar results were observed and the study expanded to include prevention and delay of ""wet"" AMD, the most devastating form of the disease.\n\nIn all the groups examined, data suggests L-DOPA may prevent or delay AMD.\n\n""This study suggests an intriguing link between patients taking L-DOPA and a lower incidence and delayed onset of AMD,"" said Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Eye Institute. ""Showing that L-DOPA causes this protective effect will require further investigation, but if confirmed, could lead to new drugs or combination therapies for AMD that target DOPA-responsive cells in the retina.""\n\nThe next step in this research is to perform a clinical trial to determine the ability of this drug to prevent AMD.\n\n""Results suggest a new path forward in our fight against AMD that may even include a strategy to prevent those at risk of the disease from ever developing it,"" said Brian McKay, Ph.D., associate professor, Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, University of Arizona. ""In the end, L-DOPA may not be the drug that ends the disease but the pathway identified is likely to be a key observation as the search for a cure continues.""\n\n###\n\nThis research, titled ""Mining Retrospective Data for Virtual Prospective Drug Repurposing: L-DOPA and Age-related Macular Degeneration,"" was supported by National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Human Genome Research Institute, Research to Prevent Blindness, Bright Focus Foundation, The Edward N. & Della L. Thome Memorial Foundation, Wisconsin Genomics Initiative, National Eye Institute, Marshfield Clinic and University of Arizona.\n\nMarshfield Clinic provides patient care, research and education with more than 50 locations in northern, central and western Wisconsin, making it one of the largest comprehensive medical systems in the United States.']",This release summarizes a study that found an association between levodopa and delayed age-related macular degeneration. It reports some aspects of the research cautiously but omits an important conflict of interest.,"This release explains results from a review of health records of thousands of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who also had taken the drug levodopa (L-DOPA).

(Courtesy of Jessie Quinn)\n\nJessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia — a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly — and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,” Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby’s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nColleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle helped create the cord-blood technique. (Courtesy of Colleen Delaney )\n\nThis therapy and another — haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient — have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n“Many patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,” said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nA dangerous process\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person’s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient’s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient’s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven’t been exposed to much life — such as bacteria and viruses — and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren’t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn’s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\n1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here’s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Caption From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here’s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Doctors were stumped by this 2-year-old boy’s symptoms. He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a “huge home run” for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n“No one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,” she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n“This is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,” Delaney said. “We can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.”\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n“It still gives me pause — I went to Costa Rica — that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,” Quinn says. “I was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It’s an indescribable feeling.”\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient’s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n‘Everybody now has a donor’\n\n“Parents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,” Jones said. “Siblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.”\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n“Despite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,” Jones said. “There are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.”\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 — primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia — but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease — acute myeloid leukemia — as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n“We knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,” Caryn Gordon said. “He decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, ‘Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.’ ”\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n“We thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,” Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient’s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney’s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.\n\nNot everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney’s clinical trial “are all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,” the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.\n\nA larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nHe beat leukemia, so why was he feeling so bad?\n\nNew therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer\n\nScientists just doubled the number of known contagious cancers']",There were too many missing pieces in the story to give readers a full picture of this area of cancer treatment.,"This is a story about the use of cord blood stem cells to combat certain blood cancers like leukemia.
Stem cell research is a well-established field at this point, and there are thousands of scientific articles on various uses of cord blood, a source of stem cells. And yet none of that evidence is brought to bear in this article. We’re even a little confused as to whether the article is squarely about cord blood transplantation or also about transplants from relatives because of a foray into the latter midway through the piece.
That said, we did appreciate how it addresses the risks of the treatment throughout the piece. We also like that the article clearly states that one person’s experience is not going to be the experience for everyone — either in the difficulty of finding a donor or in responding well to cord blood transplantation.
Overall, though, there were too many missing pieces in this story to give readers a full picture of this area of cancer treatment.

""Our findings should alleviate the concerns for safety that were based on observational data.""\n\nThe study enrolled 300 children 1 to 5 years old with mild persistent asthma. Their families were randomized to use either acetaminophen or ibuprofen as indicated for pain and fever over a 48-week period.\n\nBoth groups received the same asthma control therapies: daily inhaled glucocorticoids, as needed inhaled glucocorticoids, and daily oral leukotriene receptor antagonist. (The asthma therapies were given in varying order as part of a concurrent randomized trial, making this, in effect, a ""trial within a trial."") Medication adherence was closely monitored.\n\nOf the original 300 children, 226 (75 percent) completed the study. Children in the acetaminophen and ibuprofen groups used similar amounts of these medications for pain and/or fever (median, 5.5 doses).\n\nDuring the 48 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between groups:\n\nThe number of asthma exacerbations per child averaged 0.81 in the acetaminophen group versus 0.87 in the ibuprofen group.\n\nAt least one asthma exacerbation occurred in 49 percent of the acetaminophen group, vs. 47 percent of the ibuprofen group. At least two episodes occurred in 21 and 24 percent, respectively.\n\nThe percentage of days with full asthma control were virtually the same for acetaminophen and ibuprofen: 85.8 and 86.8 percent, respectively.\n\nUse of ""rescue"" medication (albuterol) was essentially the same: 2.8 vs. 3.0 puffs per week.\n\nUnscheduled healthcare visits for asthma were equivalent, averaging 0.75 vs. 0.76 episodes per child.\n\nWhile the study was modest in size, it was powered to detect any clinically significant differences, more so than past retrospective studies, Phipatanakul notes. ""There was no difference that would cause me to be alarmed,"" she says.\n\nThe researchers note that earlier studies linking acetaminophen with increased asthma symptoms did not use a randomized design. Those studies therefore couldn\'t rule out the possibility that the asthma exacerbations were caused by the respiratory infections themselves.\n\n""The toddler age is a wheezy age when kids are developing asthma, but they also get a lot of fevers and colds,"" says Phipatanakul. ""Without a randomized design, it\'s hard to tease out the effects of medications.""\n\nSince the study was limited to young children with mild persistent asthma receiving asthma controller therapy, the authors also note that their findings may not apply to other age groups or children with more severe asthma. Further studies will be necessary to answer those questions.\n\n###\n\nWilliam J. Sheehan, MD, of Boston Children\'s Hospital was first author on the paper.

It explains early in the text the significance of the study and gives appropriate figures in easy-to-read bullet points to support the finding that there is “absolutely no difference between Tylenol and Motrin.” (Although these two brands do contain acetaminophen and ibuprofen, respectively, we noticed that researchers actually gave Little Fevers by Little Remedies and Children’s Advil to participants.)
A short discussion of costs would have been beneficial in the news release, since acetaminophen (Little Remedies) generally tends to be more expensive than ibuprofen (Children’s Advil).
One drawback the release shared with another release we reviewed on the same study (by University Hospitals Case Medical Center) was the omission of financial ties between several study authors and the makers of branded versions of acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,"" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. ""This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nEncouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.\n\n""I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,"" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. ""We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.""\n\nThe studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.\n\nAlthough bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer\'s patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.\n\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer\'s.\n\nSalloway\'s study looked at the drug\'s safety in 194 Alzheimer\'s patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer\'s and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.\n\nNinety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.\n\nThe overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.\n\nThe other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.\n\nThese imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.\n\nBut only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.\n\n""There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,"" said Salloway. ""Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.""\n\nThe researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.\n\nBecause this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Association has more on this condition.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Huge disconnect between the headline (which focuses on benefit) and the body of the story (which focuses only on safety).  As one expert said, “We’ll have to wait…to comment on this as a potential therapy.”  So, then, why that headline? </span>","This story reports on a drug in development for people with Alzheimer’s disease.  While providing a lot of detailed information about the molecule under study and how the drug is better tolerated at lower doses, this story failed to provide any insight as to the benefit one might hope to obtain from taking this medication.  Indicating that the drug might show promise gets the readers hopes up without any framework for what it is they might expect.

In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether.\n\n""The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control,"" said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King\'s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. ""Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy.""\n\nRA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by joint inflammation and damage, functional disability and significantly increased mortality. Early intervention using a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate is critical in preventing structural joint damage and progressive loss of function. For those patients who either fail to respond, or who develop an inadequate response to these drugs over time, a biologic DMARD is an effective add-on treatment option.2 The first choice of biologic therapy is usually a TNFi2 and currently identical dosing regimens of TNFi are used both to induce and then maintain a clinical response.1\n\nOver the first six months of the study, flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) occurred in 14% of patients who stayed on the same TNFi dose, compared to a similar figure of 13% in those patients for whom the dose was reduced by one-third. A two-thirds dose reduction increased the odds of a flare occurring by four times compared with a one-third dose reduction, with flares occurring in 37% of patients. Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted. There were no significant differences in self-reported measures of disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire score) with either dose reduction strategy at six months.\n\nThe OPTTIRA study is a 12-month multicentre, randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate if reducing TNFi doses (of either etanercept or adalimumab) caused a loss of response in RA patients who were also receiving a synthetic DMARD. To be eligible, patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity (DAS28 less than 3.2) for over three months. Patients with serious concomitant illness, or those taking high-dose steroids (more than 10mg prednisolone daily) were excluded.\n\nOf the 47 patients who reduced, then stopped their TNFi after six months, 45% (21/47) succeeded without flaring, and their final mean DAS28 score after stopping treatment was 2.2, demonstrating low disease activity.\n\n###\n\nAbstract Number: SAT0150\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS:\n\nFor further information on this study, or to request an interview with the study lead, please do not hesitate to contact the EULAR congress\n\nPress Office in Room 5B of Fiera Roma during EULAR 2015 or on:\n\nEmail: eularpressoffice@cohnwolfe.com\n\nOnsite tel: +44 (0) 7738 890 799 / +44 (0) 20 7331 5442\n\nTwitter: @EULAR_Press\n\nYoutube: Eular Pressoffice\n\nAbout EULAR\n\nThe European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) is an umbrella organisation which represents scientific societies, health professional associations and organisations for people with rheumatic diseases throughout Europe.\n\nEULAR aims to promote, stimulate and support the research, prevention, and treatment of rheumatic diseases and the rehabilitation of those it affects.\n\nWith 45 scientific member societies, 35 People with Arthritis and Rheumatism in Europe (PARE) organisations, 19 health professionals associations and 21 corporate members, EULAR highlights the importance of combating rheumatic diseases through both medical means and patient care.\n\nEULAR 2015 is set to be the biggest rheumatology event in Europe with around 14,000 scientists, physicians, allied health professionals and related audiences in attendance from more than 120 countries.

It goes beyond the study to include quotes from the lead author that do a good job summarizing the work. But while the release touts the possible cost-effectiveness of the reduced-dose strategy, it does not say how much money might be saved if clinicians adopt it, or even provide a ballpark figure for what the drug costs. Perhaps direct costs aren’t as important for patients in Europe, where this release originated, but surely any journalist reporting on the story would want to put a figure on the potential savings — so why not put those numbers in the news release?

Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. Half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo. Side effects were mild to moderate and participants taking Prozac did not show increases in suicidal thoughts or ideas.\n\n“Repetitive behavior is a core symptom of the illness,” says lead author Dr. Eric Hollander, medical director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, explaining that “from a very early age, these children have rituals and routines. For example, they like to line up their toys and they get very bent out of shape if there is any deviation.”\n\nMORE: What Does a 400% Increase in Antidepressant Use Really Mean?\n\nA previous, larger study of a similar medication, Celexa (citalopram), in autistic children did not find a reduction in repetitive behaviors, but the drug did reduce irritability and was superior to placebo among children who had the highest levels of irritability. Irritability can sometimes lead to repetitive behaviors because autistic people often engage in these activities to soothe themselves.\n\nBoth Prozac and Celexa belong to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Prior research on SSRIs in autistic people has also looked at Luvox (fluvoxamine) and found a reduction in repetitive behavior in adults but not children. It is not known if the differences between these studies are due to differences between the medications or other factors.\n\nObsessive behaviors may also arise in autistic people in response to the stress or discomfort of unpredictable situations. “Many of these individuals have expectations for what’s going to happen, and if there is an unexpected deviation, they experience a lot of discomfort and then they do all these kinds of behaviors,” says Hollander. That’s why people with autism may obsessively avoid locations where they previously experienced discomfort, for example, or they may engage in a repetitive habit like washing, checking, counting, touching or tapping.\n\nWhen taking Prozac, Hollander says, “Patients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. They’re more able to go outside their comfort zone and to better resist their habits and rituals.” One participant in Hollander’s study was previously too anxious to take the subway or eat in a restaurant, but, when taking Prozac, was able to tolerate these unpredictable environments.\n\n“It takes the edge off,” Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. “The clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.”\n\nMORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics?\n\nThe only drugs approved to treat irritability and repetitive behaviors in autistic children are the atypical antipsychotics Risperdal (risperidone) and Abilify (aripiprazole), which tend to have more severe side effects than Prozac does. Those drugs carry significant risk for weight gain, diabetes and movement disorders.\n\nResponding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: “The question remains, ‘Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?’ It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.”\n\nHollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration’s “orphan” drug program. That program funds research on rare conditions with new drugs or those no longer patented that are not likely to be pursued by industry. When the research was originally funded, Hollander says, autism was considered to be a rare condition.\n\nThe study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nMaia Szalavitz is a health writer at TIME.com.

You can also continue the discussion on TIME Healthland’s Facebook page and on Twitter at @TIMEHealthland.']","This was a well-explained, well-written piece on a small, short-term study of an antidepressant to treat adult autism.","This story covers a study that adds to prior research.  A quick PubMed search finds an astonishing lack of randomized clinical trials evaluating antidepressants for autism.  Although the study is small, it is a randomized clinical trial and addresses a gap in the evidence.

REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn\n\nThe move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes.\n\nThe agency is seeking to determine a level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products that would be minimally addictive or nonaddictive, according to a draft proposal.\n\nIt hopes setting such a standard would also help prevent teenagers who experiment with tobacco from becoming addicted.\n\nThe FDA estimates that setting such a standard would help 5 million smokers quit within a year and prevent more than 33 million teens and young adults from becoming regular smokers by the year 2100.\n\n“There is no other single action our country can take that would prevent more young people from smoking or save more lives,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\nMajor tobacco players such as Altria Group and British American Tobacco are grappling with sales declines in the U.S. market and hoping to recoup revenue through novel tobacco and nicotine products such as e-cigarettes.\n\nAltria Group has partnered with Philip Morris International to sell a novel device called iQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco. The FDA is currently reviewing the iQOS application.\n\nThe FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually.\n\nThe comment period will be open through mid-June, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA will continue to take enforcement actions against companies that inappropriately target children, including through the promotion of e-cigarettes, Gottlieb said.\n\nJames Figlar, executive vice president of research and development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, part of British American Tobacco, said the company would work with the agency to create a path for alternative, less harmful tobacco products to reach the market.\n\nThe FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.\n\n“We’ll also advance key parts of our tobacco plan very soon,” he said.']","Because of its impact on the health of Americans, any intervention that aims to reduce smoking is worthy of news coverage.","This Reuters story reports on a new FDA proposal to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes in order to reduce the addictiveness of smoking.
It’s thought that such a move would help current smokers to quit their habit while also reducing the likelihood that those experimenting would get addicted. The story hits many bases, but doesn’t spend enough time discussing the evidence behind the proposal.

Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial.\n\nMore attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel—both of which are in development—the prototype pill offers a “major step forward” in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nPhilippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe prototype pill—dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)—is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone.\n\nCurrently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The “undecanoate” in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug’s journey out of the body, Page said.\n\nEighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU.\n\nWhile some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks.\n\n“Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.\n\nPage has high hopes for the results, calling them “unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.” Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said.""]","The story never points out that this recent study doesn’t prove the pill will work as intended–that is, prevent pregnancy.","The story focuses on the results of a month-long trial of an experimental “male birth control pill.” The story does a fair job of describing the study, and discusses potential harms. However, the story does not place the new research findings into context regarding the broader field of research into developing a male birth control pill. Perhaps most importantly, however, the story does not give readers much information about how effective the pill may be at actually preventing pregnancy.

The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology.\n\n""Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,"" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women\'s Behavioral Wellness. ""There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal.""\n\nThe Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks.\n\nThe researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall.\n\nWhile psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems.\n\n""Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,"" said Epperson. ""It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman\'s complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX.""\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

In Canada, that’s roughly 3.6 million people. Many of these individuals turn to adaptive devices designed to magnify objects and text, but these devices can be prohibitively expensive, uni-functional and bulky.\n\nEnter the iPad: a technological device that’s relatively cheap, serves many purposes, is smaller than most books, and — according to new research from Concordia University in Montreal — is just as effective a visual aid as traditional devices.\n\nA study recently described in Good Times Magazine provides the first experimental evidence that the Apple iPad is as good as technology traditionally used in reading rehabilitation for individuals with visual impairment.\n\nAnd that could help with stigmatization of the elderly and disabled.\n\nFor the study, the Concordia-based research team recruited 100 participants who ranged in age from 24 to 97. A little over half the participants had age-related macular degeneration, a disease characterized by the deterioration of the small central portion of the retina that is normally responsible for fine detailed vision tasks such as reading.\n\nThe researchers used questionnaires and tests to gauge participants’ visual ability, and then compared the Apple iPad versus two traditionally used magnification devices, to see if reading rates varied across devices.\n\n“Unsurprisingly, we found that most participants found it hard to read small and medium text, while nearly a quarter of them reported that reading large text was much easier,” says Elliott Morrice, an MA student in Concordia’s Department of Psychology and the study’s first author.\n\n“What was interesting to note was that it didn’t matter what technology was used to do the magnification: an iPad worked just as well as a traditional device like a closed circuit television system (CCTV),” he says. “When we took previous experience into account, we found that participants who had used iPads before read on average 30 words per minute faster than those who were using the iPad for the first time. But there were no significant differences in the reading rates of participants who had previous experience using the CCTV, compared to the reading rates of first-time CCTV users.”\n\nAnother benefit is that many older adults feel stigmatized by using the traditional devices, because they identify them as having an impairment or disability.\n\n“Tablet computers offer many of the same benefits while being socially acceptable,” says Aaron Johnson, the study’s senior author, and an associate professor in the psychology department, and a member of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal (CRIR).\n\n“What’s more, compared to the devices currently used by those with low vision, iPads are multi-functional, allowing the user to go online, check email, make video calls — and they cost less than the traditional devices,” he says. “This cost saving can be both to the individual, and if appropriate, to the insurance companies that may provide individuals with assistive devices.”\n\nPartners in research: This work was supported in part by the Vision Health Research Network, the Fonds de recherche du Québéc - Santé, the Antoine Turmel Foundation, CRIR, and the MAB-Mackay Foundation.

That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues.\n\nIn the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing.\n\nAfter downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood.\n\nThey also made fewer trips to the hospital.\n\n“We found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,” said Kristal.\n\nHowever, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.\n\nThe researchers say they don’t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice. A 16-oz bottle of POM Wonderful sells for about $4.\n\nShe said her team had found no side effects, but added that kidney patients should be aware of the high potassium content in the juice, given the delicate balance of nutrients in their blood, and talk to their doctor if they consider drinking it.\n\nBrosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm.\n\n“I would prefer to see this validated at other centers before we come out and say this is the thing to do,” he said. Even if the findings hold up, he said, it is still unclear what accounts for them. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.\n\n“This study does not demonstrate anything special about pomegranate juice,” she told Reuters Health in an e-mail. “The effects of juice were compared to a placebo, not to any other kind of juice that might have exactly the same effect.”\n\n“The pomegranate people are spending millions to prove what I could have told them in the first place,” she added. “Pomegranate juices — like most if not all fruit and vegetable juices — have antioxidant activity. Does this make pomegranates better than any other fruit? Investigators have yet to show this.”']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">If you’re going to report on health claims made for stuff like pomegranate juice, this story is almost a model of how to do so.</span>","Early and frequent caveats such as:

The findings were published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 6.5 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who regularly consumed at least two, one-ounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a 42% improvement in disease-free survival and a 57% improvement in overall survival. “Further analysis of this cohort revealed that disease-free survival increased by 46% among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts,” said Charles S. Fuchs, M.D., director of Yale Cancer Center and senior author of the study. Tree nuts include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others. In contrast, peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods. “These findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors — including increased physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages — improve colon cancer outcomes,” said Temidayo Fadelu, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the paper. “The results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship.” Additionally, the researchers emphasized, the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Many previous studies have reported that nuts, among other health benefits, may help to reduce insulin resistance, a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone. Insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type 2 diabetes and related illnesses. Earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors — such as obesity, lack of exercise, and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates — that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar. “These studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulin-resistant, including eating nuts, seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer,” Fuchs said. “However, we don’t know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial.” Nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes, Fuchs noted. Patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content, said Fuchs. For example, a one-ounce serving of about 24 almonds holds about 200 calories, including 14 grams of fat. “People ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity, which leads to worse outcomes,” he said. “But what’s really interesting is that in our studies, and across the scientific literature in general, regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner.” Dietary changes can make a difference. An earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by Fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer. When Fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices, “first and foremost I talk about avoiding obesity, exercising regularly, and staying away from a high-carbohydrate diet,” he said. “Then we talk about things like coffee and nuts. If you like coffee or nuts, enjoy them, and if you don’t, there are many other helpful steps you can take.” “Overall, we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs,” Fuchs said. Co-corresponding authors on the paper are Jeffrey Meyerhardt, M.D., of Dana-Farber and Ying Bao, M.D., of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Lead funding for the research was provided by the National Cancer Institute. Support also came from private sponsors including Pfizer Oncology and the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation. The private sponsors did not participate in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study, or in review or approval of the paper.']",This news release asserts that tree nuts can increase overall survival in colon cancer patients — but observational studies like this one are a weak form of evidence.,"A new observational study, partially funded by the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation, claims that eating two or more servings of nuts each day may increase the likelihood of survival for patients with colon cancer. Tree nuts specifically, rather than peanuts, were found to be beneficial. But like all observational studies, this one has significant pitfalls. For one, there is no way of knowing if it is nuts only that lead to health benefits–it could be healthier eating in general. There hasn’t been a definitive mechanism discovered that links nuts to cancer survival, meaning that it can be interpreted as a correlation, but not a causation. The authors of this study also used the same cohort of patients in 2015 to claim that coffee boosted colon cancer survival rates (more on that below), leading us to wonder if they are simply fishing in the data for associations.

After radiation treatment, patients often experience severe, lifelong swallowing, eating, and nutritional issues. However, new clinical trial research shows reducing radiation for some patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas can maintain high cure rates while sparing some of these late toxicities.\n\n“We found there are some patients have very high cure rates with reduced doses of radiation,” said Barbara Burtness, MD, Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology), Yale Cancer Center, Disease Research Team Leader for the Head and Neck Cancers Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and the chair of the ECOG-ACRIN head and neck committee. “Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status,” she said.\n\nThe study, published in the December 26 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, showed that patients treated with reduced radiation had less difficulty swallowing solids (40 percent versus 89 percent of patients treated with standard doses of radiation) or impaired nutrition (10 percent versus 44 percent of patients treated with regular doses of radiation).\n\n“Today, many younger patients are presenting with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,” said Dr. Burtness. “And while traditional chemoradiation has demonstrated good tumor control and survival rates for patients, too often they encounter unpleasant outcomes that can include difficulty swallowing solid foods, impaired nutrition, aspiration and feeding tube dependence,” said Dr. Burtness. “Younger patients may have to deal with these side effects for decades after cancer treatment. We want to help improve our patients’ quality of life.”\n\nThe study included 80 patients from 16 ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group sites who had stage three or four HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, and were candidates for surgery. Eligible patients received three courses of induction chemotherapy with the drugs cisplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab. Patients with good clinical response then received reduced radiation.\n\nStudy results also showed that patients who had a history of smoking less than 10 packs of cigarettes a year had a very high disease control compared with heavy smokers.\n\nOther authors on the paper include: Shanthi Marur (Johns Hopkins Medicine) and Anthony Cmelak (Vanderbilt University).']",What are the cost implications? How much is a ‘reduced dose?’ Did the low dose treat the cancer as effectively as the standard dose? Who funded the research?,"In a small study of 80 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cancers of the tonsils and throat, researchers found they could reduce side effects of radiation by reducing the radiation dose. These patients often suffer from lifelong swallowing and eating issues following radiotherapy. The short release did not provide much context. We weren’t provided any numbers for the rate of “cure” in standard doses versus the lower doses under study.

That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.\n\nThe findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.\n\nThat recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.\n\nTo further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.\n\nThe value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.\n\nSpeaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s communications committee, said: ""This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.""\n\n""Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,"" Obel added. ""The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.""\n\nThe authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.\n\nThe study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.\n\nThe reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.\n\nThe benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.\n\nJonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.\n\nIn another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.\n\n""There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,"" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.\n\nAlthough the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on mammography.']","<span style=""font-size: larger;"">The weakest of four stories we reviewed on the new Swedish mammography study.  Inadequate evaluation of the evidence – no tough questions about study design or methodology.  No discussion of costs or harms.  Imbalanced and incomplete. </span>","The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece.
 Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited.  The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nBut now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week\'s New England Journal of Medicine. And it\'s clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.\n\nIt does work, sort of.\n\nIn the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That\'s better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.\n\nBut, as the study\'s lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, ""It\'s not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.""\n\nThe primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn\'t shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. ""Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,"" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.\n\nDeep in the data is further mystery.\n\nProvenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient\'s own white blood cells.\n\nThe theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients\' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn\'t survive any longer than those who didn\'t.\n\nThe other side of the immune system – the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn\'t.\n\nNobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he\'d be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.\n\nThe way the study was done, he says, ""does not allow one to conclude"" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.\n\nBut, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it\'s not surprising there\'s a lot to be learned, and that it\'s pretty pricey.\n\nOther immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there\'s a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat. But the company can only make enough at this point for 2,000 patients in the first year.\n\nSo does the waiting list contain thousands of men? Tens of thousands? ""Can\'t say,"" replies Dendreon COO Hans Bishop.']",Let us count the ways we liked this story.

But researchers say this is the first study to look at the effects of adding beet juice to a heathy person’s diet without making any other diet or lifestyle changes.\n\nThe results appear in Nutrition Journal.\n\nIn the study, 15 men and 15 women drank either 17.6 ounces of a beet juice beverage consisting of about three-fourths beet juice and one-fourth apple juice, or a placebo juice. They were then monitored for 24 hours. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later, with those who drank the placebo on the first round receiving beetroot juice on the second.\n\nAmong both men and women, the results showed a trend to lower systolic blood pressure six hours after drinking the beet juice.\n\nBut when researchers limited their analysis to men only, they found a significant reduction of about 4.7 points among those who drank the beetroot juice.\n\nPrevious studies have also suggested that beetroot’s blood-pressure-lowering effects may not be as strong in women.\n\nIn this case, Coles says it may be partially explained by the fact that the women in the study tended to be older, and many were on prescription medications, such as oral contraceptives.']","This WebMD story never reported the main finding of the study, which is that beet juice had no effect on blood pressure in the study overall. The headline, “Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure,” is not supported by the published research paper.  The story only gets a  3-star score because of satisfactory grades on the easy criteria; it flunked all of the more vital criteria.  Don’t judge a story by its star score.  Read the entire review.","You would never know it from reading this story, but this was actually a negative study. Here is what the authors reported in the body of their paper under “Results”: “Overall, there was no significant difference in treatments for any parameter except day time pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) of 1 mmHg higher on the placebo treatment.  There were no statistically significant differences between the juices in average day time or night time blood pressures or heart rate.”
The statistically significant reductions in blood pressure reported by the story were found only in men (a subgroup representing only half the participants whose results should be interpreted very cautiously), at a specific timepoint (6 hours after ingestion), and only after the authors adjusted their analysis for baseline differences between the beet juice and placebo groups. Experts differ about the appropriateness of such statistical tinkering in a randomized trial, another reason why this result should be viewed very carefully.
So the overall conclusion should have been that beet juice did not lower blood pressure (at least not a statistically significant degree), and that there were some interesting trends suggesting a possible benefit that needs confirmation in stronger studies.
The paper, as published, addressed some of these issues about subgroup analyses of men only at 6 hours after consumption in the Conclusion section (a result of poor editing on the part of the journal, which arguably should not have allowed it).  You need to read the whole paper to get the whole story.

Every Movement Counts, Even Cleaning the House","[""You don’t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity, according to new research in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise—like running errands and cleaning the house—was linked to a lower risk of death.\n\nModerate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. “The paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,” says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.\n\nFor the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nBased on the data from the women’s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.\n\nLight physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn’t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults’ daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.\n\n“We’ve always been told that this type of activity isn’t enough to do you good,” says LaCroix. “But what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman’s risk of dying over the next three to four years—and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.”\n\nMORE: TIME’s Guide to Exercise\n\nThe study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.\n\nAs adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says—so they don’t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. “We know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,” she says. “It’s not one size fits all.”\n\nBut national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week.

Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don’t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. “What makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,” she says.\n\nThe researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people—especially older ones—think about exercise and their goals for being active. “I think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don’t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,” LaCroix says. “They throw up their hands and think, ‘that’s not for me.’ But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","As a TIME story points out, a new study on light activity and reduced mortality can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship, yet the story never really explains why this is the case.","The story recaps a recent study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society that used accelerometers to track the activity of women between the ages of 63 and 99. The study followed study participants for a mean of 3.1 years, tracking mortality for all participants. The study found that even “light activity” reduced the relative risk of dying during the study period. In other words, even light physical activity can contribute to health.
The story did a good job explaining what “light activity” means in this context, and explaining how the study was designed.
But, when it came to the risk reduction, we wanted to know what this translated to in absolute terms, but the story doesn’t say. Also, as the story points out, the study can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship between light activity and reduced mortality. Yet the story never really explains why this is the case, and it contradicts itself with the clickbait headline.

""While such changes may be detected with MRI, we believe there may be a less expensive and portable way to measure these changes with a transcranial Doppler (TCD) device.""\n\nMore than one million athletes experience a concussion each year in the United States.\n\nTCD uses ultrasound to map blood flow activity in the brain. Traditionally, it has measured variables like the speed and variability (pulse) of blood flowing through the arteries. But those measurements haven\'t been enough to accurately detect concussion.\n\nFor this study, researchers used an advanced version of TCD ultrasound to get a more complete picture of just how the blood moves through the middle cerebral artery, one of the three major arteries in the brain.\n\nResearchers compared a group of 66 high school athletes in contact sports who had been recently diagnosed with a concussion to a control group of 169 high school student athletes from both contact and non-contact sports. Examples of collision sports included in the study were football, soccer, basketball, hockey, water polo and lacrosse. The non-contact sports included were cheerleading, cross country, cycling, tennis and track. Both the control and concussion groups were approximately 30 percent female.\n\nEach of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. They were also given a general concussion evaluation and had their blood pressure checked.\n\nThe study found that the advanced version of TCD ultrasound was able to differentiate between healthy and concussed athletes 83 percent of the time. This is in contrast to traditional TCD ultrasound measurements like change in cerebral blood flow reactivity which differentiated between the two 60 percent of the time, average blood flow speed which differentiated 55 percent of the time and blood flow resistance which differentiated 53 percent of the time.\n\n""This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion,"" said Hamilton. ""While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing.""\n\n""This important work provides insight into a tool that may yet prove useful in the recognition and management of concussion,"" said Jeffrey Kutcher, MD, FAAN, with the The Sports Neurology Clinic in Brighton, Michigan. ""The potential of having an accessible technology that detects a physiological change following brain trauma is very exciting. However, what these detected blood flow changes mean to a patient\'s clinical care is still unclear.""\n\n""This is an important area of research. Testing of the TCD technique at the sideline at the time of injury will be an important next step to determine its ultimate utility,"" said Randolph S. Marshall, MD, MS, with Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and a member of the American Academy of Neurology\'s Science Committee.\n\nThe study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\nLearn more about concussion at www.aan.com/concussion, where you can access the AAN\'s Sports Concussion Guideline, QuickCheck app, and other resources.\n\nThe American Academy of Neurology, an association of 30,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals, is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient-centered neurologic care.

When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience “off” time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson’s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. “If a person with Parkinson’s disease can reduce their ‘off’ times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,” said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. “In some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.” The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson’s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of “off” time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less “off” time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in “off” time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of “on” time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. “It is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,” said Katzenschlager. The study was supported by Britannia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the maker of apomorphine.

The study followed 107 people with advanced Parkinson’s disease for 12 weeks after treating them with either apomorphine or placebo. The study measured the participants’ “off” times, which refer to periods when a medication isn’t working well, causing symptoms to worsen.
Although the news release provides in-depth historical context and information on the availability of the drug, we wish it could have more critically evaluated the evidence, as well as provided more numbers to illustrate the benefit claims.
A discussion on the limitations of evidence, namely how this study may have been through limited peer review, would have been useful.

Numbness and pain stemming from nerve damage were the most common adverse event connected to eribulin that led women to drop out of the study (24, or 5 percent).\n\nThe study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin.

The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians.\n\nAn Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/Files\n\nNo new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha’s effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients.\n\nThe trial was widely expected to be positive, especially after a smaller study presented in November showed Repatha therapy led to regression of artery-clogging plaque, an underlying cause of heart disease.\n\n“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.\n\nDetails on the magnitude of benefit will be revealed in mid-March at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, D.C. Industry analysts have been looking for a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events.\n\nRepatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins.\n\nBut those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.\n\nRepatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Corp and Sanofi have had endured anemic sales as a result.\n\nAmgen reported just $40 million in third-quarter sales. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled.\n\nThe primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. At the heart meeting in March, researchers will also provide details on risk reduction for each of the components, such as non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death.\n\nThe primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina.""]",This story reads more like marketing copy than journalism.,"This Reuters story looks at the results of a clinical trial for Repatha, and claims that the drug “significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease.” 
Fortunately, the story touched on the high cost of the drug and concerns over insurance coverage. Other than that, though, it falls short, offering no data to back up the claims about the benefit of this drug. The story did tell us why there’s no data– “because the result of the trial will only be released next month at a scientific conference”–yet because of the lack of specifics, it reads more like marketing copy than journalism. We’d argue it’s more responsible to readers to wait for the actual data to be released–so it can be vetted by outside experts–than publicizing unverified results. At the very least, any story reporting on these results should be clear that they need to be consumed with a healthy side of caution and skepticism, given the company’s obvious incentive to frame the data positively.
Not surprisingly, some of these same problems were noted in our review of the news release from Amgen, Repatha’s manufacturer.

They are simple leaves, oblong and egg-like or oblong and elliptical in shape and between 5 and 15 cm in length. This species is native to the tropical areas of the Americas and is especially abundant in the Amazon region. It is usually cultivated for its medicinal use.

The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.\n\nCurrently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.\n\nExperts describe Abbott\'s device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n""This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that\'s the theory, but it will take years to prove,"" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.\n\nThe Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that\'s designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.\n\nUse of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.\n\nBut doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.\n\nAmid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.\n\nIn the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott\'s older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent. That 1.7 percent difference is not considered statistically significant.\n\nOther complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding.\n\nDoctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Long-term safety results aren\'t expected until 2020.\n\n""We have good theoretical reasons to believe that by getting rid of the stent, and allowing the coronary artery to restore its normal shape, that will prevent many of those late events,"" said Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center, who helped conduct the pivotal trial of Absorb. Stone was not paid by Abbott for his work on the trial.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.\n\n""The key for the stent market will be whether pricing returns to rational levels and the success of the new bio-absorbable stent platforms,"" states Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, in an investment note.

That important warning should be of great use to heart disease patients and is nowhere to be found in a Reuters story about the FDA decision, which reads more like a celebratory press release.
That said, two things we’d have welcomed in this story: First, a frank discussion about what patients should do if they’re facing stent placement–do they typically have any choice in what kind of stent they receive? Is it reasonable to refuse this method until more data is in? And second, what is the actual material used in the stent, and is it used in other medical devices?

Most of the population is thought to get adequate amounts for that reason.\n\nDuring the study, Sweden did not fortify foods, nor did kids use a lot of supplements. Folic acid is naturally present in green, leafy vegetables and legumes.\n\nThe new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues.\n\nThe researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets.\n\nTeens in the top third of folic acid intake — more than 253 micrograms per day for girls and 335 for boys — scored grades of 139 out of 200, on average. Those in the bottom third — less than 173 micrograms folic acid per day for girls and 227 for boys — had an average score of only 120.\n\nThe differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to.\n\nO’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”\n\nStill, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.\n\n“It’s not a randomized controlled trial, so you always wonder, are there other things going on that you weren’t able to control for?” she said. “Like most studies, it probably raises more questions than it answers.”\n\nIn the U.S., kids aged 9 to 13 should get a total of 300 micrograms of folate a day from food and supplements according to the Institute of Medicine’s “Dietary Reference Intakes.” Kids 14 and older and adults are urged to get 400 micrograms a day and pregnant women should get 600 micrograms.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/cxXOG Pediatrics, online July 11, 2011.']","In fewer than 500 words, this story did a good job explaining what a study found and putting that observation into context.

Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients\' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease.\n\nThe possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala.\n\n""There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,"" she added.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients\' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise.\n\nNational statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66.\n\n""Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"" said Vapiwala. ""Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence.""\n\nSpecifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study\'s feasibility endpoint was met.\n\n""Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,"" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting.\n\nMost yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said.\n\nThe effect of yoga was measured by participants\' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients.\n\nSeverity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends.\n\nCurrently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population.\n\nThis trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center\'s integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage.\n\n""We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,"" Vapiwala said. ""This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs.""\n\nNearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study.\n\nThe full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016.\n\n###']",This confusing release about enrolling men undergoing radiation treatments for prostate cancer in yoga classes left us looking for more details. Unfortunately the study won’t be published until sometime next year. Was the objective of the study to dispel the belief that men wouldn’t enroll in yoga or to measure the benefits of yoga in easing radiation side effects?,"This may be a tough release for readers to sort out because, like the headline (“Yoga may lessen side effects in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment”), and the subhead (“More men willing to participate in yoga therapy than expected, Penn study finds”), the messages the release is sending out are wildly divergent, with scant evidence to back up either thesis.
At its core, the release focuses on an unpublished “feasibility study” that was presented at the recently concluded Society for Integrative Oncology annual conference. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine radiation oncology department claim that levels of fatigue, sexual health, and urinary incontinence remained stable among a small group of men (27) undergoing outpatient radiation therapy who completed an intensive yoga program.
The idea that more men than expected participated in the yoga class seemingly came out of the blue. It’s unclear where that idea came from.
Just as we hold news releases to the same standards as news stories, so do we hold complementary medicine to the same standards as traditional medicine. We need facts.

In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina\'s electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells.

Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami\'s Center for Liver Diseases.\n\nThe greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to ""come out of the woodwork,"" said Schiff, who\'s familiar with the study findings. ""They\'ll want to know if they\'re positive.""\n\nAn estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death.\n\nExisting treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people\'s genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said.\n\nAnd there\'s another potential problem with existing treatments. The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be ""pretty hard to deal with,"" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus. It appears to work by interfering with a protective coating around a part of the virus that\'s key to its ability to reproduce, Meanwell said.\n\nIn a phase 1 trial, the first of three types of studies that new drugs must go through, researchers gave doses of the drug to a small number of people.\n\nThe level of the virus in their bodies dropped significantly for several days. The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said.\n\nAt this point, it\'s not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs. However, Meanwell said, it could become part of a combination treatment of several drugs.\n\nSchiff, the University of Miami doctor, said other companies are pursuing similar drugs.\n\nFor now, much of the attention in the world of liver disease is on two drugs -- telaprevir and boceprevir -- that Schiff expects will become available within the next year and a half.\n\nCombination treatments using these drugs will become the standard treatment for many people, he said, and boost cure rates into the range of 70 to 80 percent. The drugs now under development, like the one in the new study, could be added to the regimen, he said.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on hepatitis C.']","While the story deserves credit for pointing out the limitations of early clinical research upfront, doing so doesn’t provide a license to hype potential benefits and pass along inappropriate predictions in the rest of the story.   ","This story about an experimental hepatitis C treatment known as BMS-790052 wants to have it both ways. It leads off by telling us the drug is in very early clinical testing; we don’t know if the drug works; and that it will be years before it could ever be dispensed to patients. But then it proceeds to speculate irresponsibly about how the drug could be used with two other experimental drugs to potentially ""cure"" many people with hepatitis-C and encourage others to get tested. Also troubling is a prediction that these other experimental drugs will get approved by 2011 and become a ""standard treatment"" for many people with hepatitis C. This crystal ball-gazing comes courtesy of a researcher who has financial ties, not disclosed in the story, with all three drug manufacturers who are developing the new treatments discussed in the article.

The study was published online Aug. 6, 2015, in the European Heart Journal.\n\nThe findings may sway the ongoing debate over testosterone therapy\'s benefits and risks, especially for the heart. Studies over the past few years have yielded mixed results, although part of that might stem from differing patient populations and research methods.\n\nFor example, the new VA study excluded men with a history of heart attacks or strokes, although it did include those with existing heart disease. A much-cited VA database study that was published in JAMA in 2013 looked specifically at men with coronary artery disease; about 20 percent of the total study group of around 8,700 men had suffered a prior heart attack.\n\nSo far, the medical community lacks results from any definitive clinical trial that might provide clear guidance. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration issued guidance earlier in 2015 advising clinicians about the over-use of testosterone therapy, and pointing to a possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe new VA study is likely to draw attention because of its large size and relatively long follow-up period.\n\nDr. Rajat Barua, the paper\'s corresponding author, says the study is also noteworthy because of its finding that administering the right dose is critical: Treating ""low T"" but not restoring levels to normal doesn\'t appear to impart much benefit, at least in terms of cardiovascular risk. Testosterone isn\'t prescribed with the goal of improving heart health, but that is a consideration in many cases.\n\n""It is the first study to demonstrate that significant benefit is observed only if the dose is adequate to normalize the total testosterone levels,"" Barua and his coauthors wrote. ""Patients who failed to achieve the therapeutic range after testosterone replacement therapy did not see a reduction in [heart attack] or stroke and had significantly less benefit on mortality.""\n\nBarua is with the Kansas City (Mo.) VA Medical Center. He\'s also an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe study team looked at national data on more than 83,000 men with documented low testosterone, all age 50 or above, who received care in VA between 1999 and 2014.\n\nThe researchers divided the men into three clinical groups: those who were treated to the point where their total testosterone levels returned to normal (Group 1); those who were treated but without reaching normal (Group 2); and those who were untreated and remained at low levels (Group 3).\n\nImportantly, all three groups were ""propensity matched"" so the comparisons would be between men with similar health profiles. The researchers took into account a wide array of factors that might affect cardiovascular and overall risk. They included, for example, age, body mass index, various chronic diseases, LDL cholesterol levels, and the use of aspirin, beta blockers, and statins.\n\nThe average follow-up across the groups ranged from 4.6 to 6.2 years.\n\nThe sharpest contrast emerged between Group 1 (those who were treated and attained normal levels) and Group 3 (those whose low testosterone went untreated). The treated men were 56 percent less likely to die during the follow-up period, 24 percent less likely to suffer a heart attack, and 36 percent less likely to have a stroke.\n\nThe differences between Group 1 and Group 2 (those who were treated but did not attain normal levels) were similar but less pronounced.\n\nLittle difference emerged between Groups 2 and 3, except for a slight benefit in survival for those who were treated.\n\nBarua and colleagues say they don\'t know the exact reasons for testosterone\'s apparent benefits for the heart and overall survival. ""The mechanisms for these effects remain speculative,"" they write. Possible explanations, they say, could involve body fat, insulin sensitivity, lipids, blood platelets, inflammation, or other biological pathways. More research is needed, they say, to clarify how testosterone affects the cardiovascular system.\n\nWhile the new study results do seem to advocate for testosterone replacement therapy, Barua stresses the need for ""appropriate screening, selection, dosing, and follow-up of patients to maximize the benefit of testosterone therapy.""\n\nThe authors also caution that ""off-label"" use remains a concern. In other words, doctors should not write a prescription simply because an older man is complaining of symptoms such as low energy and low sex drive. According to the FDA, ""Testosterone products are FDA-approved only for use in men who lack or have low testosterone levels in conjunction with an associated medical condition. Examples of these conditions include failure of the testicles to produce testosterone because of reasons such as genetic problems or chemotherapy. ... None of the FDA-approved testosterone products are approved for use in men with low testosterone levels who lack an associated medical condition.""\n\n###']",Well-written in general. But we were looking for a more clear-cut statement regarding what this observational study can and cannot tell us.,"
An observational study of some 83,000 men whose low levels of testosterone were either treated or untreated finds that returning those levels to “normal” was associated with a lower risk of death, stroke, or heart attack.  The research joins a growing number of studies of the effects of testosterone therapy that, together, constitute a mixed landscape of results. It’s unclear if this release will help readers navigate that landscape with more confidence. There’s nothing sensational or overblown about the description of the study or its findings, and there is substantial detail on the methodology and at least a hint toward limitations. There is some solid, commendable writing here. What we were looking for was a more clear-cut statement regarding what this study can and cannot tell us — specifically that it’s unclear if testosterone treatment or some other factor is responsible for the cardiovascular benefits that were observed by the researchers. We thought that would help clear up what can be a confusing topic for consumers.

Thermal energy in the form of steam is applied to the prostate with a needle. As it cools it releases heat energy into the tissue, killing cells and shrinking the prostate overall by about a third, says Bob Paulson, NxThera’s chief executive.\n\nSome 50% of men over the age of 50 have enlarged prostates, which can produce symptoms such as increased urgency to urinate during the day and frequent urination, which disrupts sleep at night. Sufferers often must choose between surgery or medication, both of which have side effects, including sexual dysfunction.\n\nThe NxThera therapy is the second major innovation in recent years for men with enlarged prostates. The other, an implanted device called UroLift, was introduced in the U.S. in 2013 by NeoTract Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif.\n\nAfter years of little improvement in the minimally invasive treatment of enlarged prostates, men now have two new options “that leave your sexual function intact,” says Claus G. Roehrborn, a professor and chairman of the department of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a co-author of published studies on both treatments.\n\nMiddle ground\n\nPhysicians say Rezūm can be used on a wider range of prostate anatomies than the UroLift implant. The procedure, which costs about $2,000 and generally is covered by insurance, can be done in a doctor’s office in just a few minutes. To dull pain, lidocaine may be injected into the prostate, and most doctors will offer a sedative for patients who want one. After the procedure, most patients need to wear a catheter for two or three days but can return to daily activities immediately.\n\nWhile the results of a two-year clinical trial published by Dr. Roehrborn and colleagues show that Rezūm provides significant relief from symptoms, it isn’t clear how long the improvement will last.\n\n“The durability issue is what’s going to sink or swim this procedure,” says study co-author Kevin T. McVary, chairman and professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, in Springfield, Ill. Both minimally invasive options are likely less effective than surgery, Dr. Roehrborn says, because surgery removes the most tissue.\n\nStill, for many men, the steam treatment offers an appealing middle ground between the risk of surgery and the hassle and side effects of taking daily medication, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.\n\n“I tried Flomax for about two years but the side effects were too annoying,” says Stephen Gooding, a 60-year-old utility supervisor from Grayson, Ga., who says the drug made him dizzy and constipated. He had the Rezūm procedure in October, and now “I feel like I did 30 years ago.”\n\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.\n\nIn the two-year study of 197 men, funded by NxThera and published online in the Journal of Urology in December, patients who had the Rezūm procedure showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms at three months compared with patients who had a sham procedure. At the end of two years, patients treated with Rezūm showed a 51% reduction in urinary symptoms (as measured by a seven-question survey), compared with the beginning of the study.\n\nOver the two years, about 4% of the patients who underwent Rezūm had to have a repeat procedure or surgery to treat their condition. Early in the trial, physicians were new at performing the procedure and didn’t always remove enough tissue, says Cindy Ogden, vice president, clinical affairs at NxThera.\n\nSo far, Rezūm appears to spare men sexual side effects. In the surgical procedure known as transurethral resection, 70% to 80% of men generally get a condition called retrograde ejaculation, also called dry orgasm, says Dr. McVary.\n\nIn the Rezūm study, about 3% of the patients who underwent the procedure experienced no ejaculatory volume afterward, and 5.3% experienced a decrease in ejaculatory volume, according to data provided by NxThera. Ejaculatory volume can fluctuate over time in men with enlarged prostates, so it isn’t clear the reductions were caused by the procedure, Dr. McVary says. Overall in the study, there was no average change in ejaculatory volume, he adds.\n\nLarger prostates\n\nA major advantage of Rezūm is that it can be done on most types of anatomies. UroLift isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the median, or middle lobe of the prostate, which contributes to symptoms in about 10% to 30% of patients, Dr. Roehrborn says.\n\nThe FDA hasn’t cleared Rezūm or UroLift for prostates weighing more than 80 grams. So NxThera can’t market its procedure for larger prostates, though doctors can legally use it on such patients if they choose.\n\nEarly results in clinical practice on large prostates appear “promising” and a study on prostates up to 150 grams is expected to begin later this year, says Ricardo Gonzalez, a urologist at Texas Medical Center in Houston, who will be a principal investigator on the research. About a quarter of men seeking treatment for prostate-related urinary symptoms have prostates greater than 80 grams, he says.\n\nBusiness executive Jim Bracke, 69, says that, with just a Tylenol and the lidocaine shot, discomfort from Rezūm’s steam blasts felt no more intense than “warm water spilled on the groin.” He drove himself home after the procedure, and says he’s thrilled that he no longer needs to check out a bathroom the moment he arrives at a restaurant. And as long as he doesn’t overdo it, he adds, “I can have beer, and coffee and chocolate and still sleep through the night.”\n\nCorrections\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Claus G. Roehrborn in the photo caption. April 24, 2017.\n\nMiss Johannes is a writer in Boston. She can be reached at reports@wsj.com.']",It raises the possibility that the story is presenting the rosiest possible take on this technology and its effects.,"The story focuses on a relatively new treatment for patients with enlarged prostates who have related urinary problems, such as the need to urinate frequently. The treatment has been clinically available since late 2016, and the story also refers to a study published online in the Journal of Urology in December 2016. The treatment is called “Rezūm,” and involves using targeted blasts of steam to shrink prostate tissue.

""It is likely to change stroke treatment guidelines and clinical practice.""\n\nCampbell said tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase because of differences in the enzymes in each drug.\n\nAlthough both drugs work in the same way, tenecteplase is better at attacking and dissolving clots, and more resistant to factors that inhibit the breakdown of clots, he said.\n\nFor either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.\n\nAlthough tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it\'s not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.\n\n""Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,"" he said. ""One reason is it\'s cheaper than alteplase.""\n\nIn the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.\n\nIn addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.\n\nArora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.\n\nFor the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.\n\nThe researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.\n\nThe investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.\n\nPatients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.\n\nBleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.\n\nThe report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on stroke, visit the National Stroke Association.']","On the flipside, it missed significant limitations to the evidence, the most significant one being that there is ","This story reported on a study that compared a newer clot-buster to treat strokes involving a blocked artery — the most common kind — to the current standard drug, alteplase (also known as tPA).
The story included cost data on the two drugs, mentioned the frequency of an important harm, and let readers know that the newer drug isn’t yet approved to treat stroke in the U.S. On the flipside, it missed significant limitations to the evidence, the most significant one being that there is no evidence that clot-busters save lives in stroke patients, as we have written.

It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.\n\n""We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,"" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern\'s McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school\'s Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. ""In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.""\n\nOne expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.\n\n""It sounds like an exciting development,"" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. ""Because it\'s so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,"" Bruno said.\n\nCurrently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.\n\nAlthough SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don\'t respond well.\n\nGLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn\'t projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won\'t respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.\n\nMoskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won\'t need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.\n\nThe GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug\'s effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.\n\nThe results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team\'s animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\nMoskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.\n\nThe study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.\n\nGLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn\'t have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.\n\nMoskal\'s team developed a new way to target the brain\'s NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.\n\nAntidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.\n\nA new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.\n\nBecause the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer\'s disease, the researchers suggested.\n\nFor his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.\n\nFindings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about depression, visit the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.']","This story does some things quite well, but still gets unsatisfactory scores on some of what we consider to be key criteria.","The story does a great job in highlighting a potential conflict of interest and also in cautioning that data presented at scientific meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Newly postmenopausal women who received estrogen via a skin patch had reduced beta-amyloid deposits, the sticky plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, a Mayo Clinic study published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found. Ultimately, these deposits harm neurons, leading to cognitive problems.\n\nIn the study, women with APOE e4 — one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease — had lower levels of amyloid deposits.\n\n“This study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition ─ a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease ─ is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,” says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. “Women with APOE e4, who have a greater genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, particularly benefited from this therapy.”\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: Susan Barber Lindquist, Mayo Clinic Public Affairs, 507-284-5005, newsbureau@mayo.edu\n\nMenopause is defined as occurring 12 months after a woman’s last menstrual period and marks the end of menstrual cycles. In the U.S., the average age of menopause is 51. A rapid decline in estrogen with menopause may be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease risk in women.\n\nThe Women’s Health Initiative study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that menopausal hormone therapy started in women 65 or older increased the risk of dementia. In contrast, the multicenter Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study tested the hypothesis that healthy and younger women would respond to menopausal hormone therapy more favorably.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study used data from the Kronos study to determine the effects of menopausal hormone therapy shortly after menopause, during the critical window of rapid estrogen depletion — five to 36 months past menopause. Researchers investigated the brain amyloid deposition in 68 women ages 42 to 59 who participated in the Kronos trial during this critical window. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended.\n\nOf the 68 women, 21 received estrogen via a skin patch, 17 received estrogen orally and 30 received a placebo. Amyloid deposition was lower in women who received the patch, compared to the placebo, and the effect was most apparent in women with the APOE e4 genotype. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition.\n\nThe authors are seeking funding to perform amyloid PET imaging at eight more Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention study sites around the U.S.\n\n“If our results are confirmed in the larger group of women, this finding has the potential to change the concepts for preventive interventions that drive the Alzheimer’s disease field today,” Dr. Kantarci says. “It also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.”\n\nStudy co-authors are Val Lowe, M.D.; Timothy Lesnick, M.S.; Nirubol Tosakulwong; Kent Bailey, Ph.D.; Julie Fields, Ph.D.; Lynne Shuster, M.D.; Samantha Zuk; Matthew Senjem M.S.; Michelle Mielke, Ph.D.; Clifford Jack Jr., M.D.; Walter Rocca, M.D.; and Virginia Miller, Ph.D., all of Mayo Clinic; and Carey Gleason, Ph.D., of University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n\nThis study is funded by the Aurora Foundation to the Kronos Longevity Research Institute and NIH.

The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study’s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer’s disease. A better headline might have been: “Pilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer’s Risk.” Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done.

An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.\n\nThe new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.\n\n""The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,"" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. ""Ideally, you won\'t need ultrasound, or at least you\'ll need less ultrasound.""\n\nThat\'s important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says.

It touts benefits of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors without mentioning potential harms. It fails to tell readers that the trial included only a subset of patients and thus the results may not necessarily apply to people with diabetes in general. It implies that the improvement seen in the intermediate endpoint measured (A1C blood sugar levels) will actually reduce the risk of eye, kidney, heart and other diseases without making clear that this trial was not designed to reveal differences in actual health outcomes. It makes no mention of the financial ties between the researchers and insulin pump manufacturers, even though the researchers’ published conflict of interest disclosure summary was substantially longer than the news story itself.

The study looked at 1,500 patients in Liberia, and took place amid and after the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia from 2014 into 2015.\n\nFive hundred participants received a vaccine developed by Merck & Co., 500 got one from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which was based on work by the National Institutes of Health, and 500 received a placebo.\n\nWith the Merck vaccine, at one month, 83.7% of patients had developed antibodies to Ebola virus, versus 70.8% with the Glaxo vaccine and a negligible number, 2.8%, in the placebo group. The relationship of antibody responses was similar after 12 months, with 79.5%, 63.5% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, showing antibody response.\n\nThere is a “reasonable chance that either of these vaccines would play a role in preventing infection,” said H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a principal investigator in this study. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. The Liberian Ministry of Health and other researchers also conducted the study.\n\nThe West African Ebola outbreak—the worst in recorded history—caused an estimated 11,000 deaths amid 25,582 cases in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal in half or more cases, spread from West Africa to a handful of cases in Europe and the U.S., including among health care workers. The disease appears and disappears unpredictably in the African forests, and is widely believed to be spread by bats.\n\nIn Dr. Lane’s view, given previously existing positive evidence from a Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, if doctors in a future epidemic had to choose, it would probably be the one from Merck.\n\nThat Merck vaccine was shown to be “highly efficacious” during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea by World Health Organization doctors writing in The Lancet in December. But the methodology of that study—including the lack of a placebo group—raised questions among some scientists about how conclusive those findings were.\n\nA detailed report by the prestigious National Academy of Medicine in April questioned the methodology of the Merck vaccine study in Guinea. It concluded the Merck vaccine “most likely provides some protection” to recipients but that the protection “could in reality be quite low.”\n\nOne of the authors of that Academy of Medicine report, vaccine specialist and pediatrics professor Kathryn M. Edwards of Vanderbilt University, said the new evidence shows “the safety of the two vaccines is comparable.” But she said any comparison of the two vaccines based on the antibody evidence “is a bit undecided” because it is unknown precisely what antibody levels are needed to protect patients.\n\nMerck said the “safety and immunogenicity results observed” in this most recent research “are consistent with what we observed in other studies.” GSK said it is too early to know whether the immunity differences between the two vaccines “indicate a clinically meaningful difference.” The NIH/GSK vaccine was the focus of a page-one Wall Street Journal article about it and the NIH scientist, Nancy J. Sullivan, who developed it.\n\nThe two different studies arose through a kind of scientific war. Several British and other European medical groups, including some who funded the Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, had argued that giving any patients a placebo wasn’t ethical in the middle of a raging epidemic. But U.S. government doctors, including leaders of the NIH, said a placebo group was necessary to ensure patients truly got benefit, and weren’t harmed, from either a vaccine or a drug.\n\nThis current study, in Liberia, was designed to avoid those pitfalls through its classic placebo-controlled design. But it ran into another obstacle: Ebola cases in Liberia began to dwindle early in 2015, and the outbreak there was declared over on May 9 of that year. By the time this work was fully under way, it was too late to see if vaccines actually prevented Ebola sickness and death.\n\nIt still was possible, however, to measure patients’ immune-systems’ response, measured by how many produced significant antibodies to the Ebola virus. Also, vaccine safety could be assessed, and both vaccines appeared safe.\n\nNIH scientists now are evaluating antibody levels out to two years.\n\nThe level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than either vaccine group, and “most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria,” the researchers wrote.\n\nWrite to Thomas M. Burton at tom.burton@wsj.com']","That said, we think the story would have been stronger had it been more clear on the industry connections behind the study, and if it had discussed availability of the vaccine–especially if a new outbreak occurs.","This Wall Street Journal story reports on a New England Journal of Medicine-published study of the trial of two potential vaccines against Ebola disease.

That said, we think the story would have been stronger had it been more clear on the industry connections behind the study, and if it had discussed availability of the vaccine–especially if a new outbreak occurs.

She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted — a test that\'s so new, some women and doctors don\'t quite realize what they\'ve signed up for.\n\nThis kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It\'s only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.\n\n""I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,"" says Seitz. ""They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.""\n\nTo her, it sounded great. She didn\'t want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.\n\n""I wasn\'t interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,"" she explains, ""and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.""\n\nThis new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn\'t as familiar with it — although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company\'s sales representative.\n\n""I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,"" Seitz says.\n\nSeitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who\'ve opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.\n\n""Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,"" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.""\n\nBut, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they\'re dealing with.\n\n""It\'s still new and it\'s quite different than previous genetic testing that\'s been available,"" says Norton. ""It\'s quite a different paradigm, if you will.""\n\nAn invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.\n\nUntil the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there\'s an increased risk of certain disorders, but it\'s not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.\n\nStudies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They\'re less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.\n\n""They\'re much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,"" says Norton, ""and so I think that has led to some confusion.""\n\nEven though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can\'t give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they\'re analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother\'s blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.\n\nNorton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don\'t understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio ""because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.""\n\nShe is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.\n\n""There\'s at least some evidence that it\'s happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,"" she says.\n\nThe tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies\' websites and marketing materials don\'t make the limitations clear enough.\n\nBut Dr. Lee Shulman doesn\'t see it that way. He\'s an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.\n\n""Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,"" he says. ""Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.""\n\nHe says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.\n\n""If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,"" says Shulman.\n\nFor example, here\'s one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby\'s sex — weeks before it\'s clear on a sonogram.\n\n""Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,"" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nWhat they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there\'s something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.\n\n""Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there\'s an extra X or extra Y,"" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.\n\nSeitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn\'t do that, because of a paperwork glitch.\n\n""The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren\'t able to find it out from the test,"" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.']",Prenatal screening tests should not be confused with diagnostic tests. This story explains why.,"This story reports on several newer, noninvasive prenatal screening tests called cell-free DNA tests. These tests work by examining pieces of fetal DNA from a blood sample taken from the mother. Although more accurate than traditional screening tests (blood tests plus an ultrasound), the new tests are not accurate enough to provide a definitive diagnosis. This can only be obtained from a more invasive procedure such as amniocentesis. The story did a good job of explaining the confusion surrounding these new tests, which is a result of some doctors and women not understanding the tests’ limitations and accuracy levels compared with other tests. The story could have provided more numbers — including costs and false positive rates — to help readers better understand the tradeoffs involved.

It reports on two Lancet studies that compiled data from 9 and 26 trials, respectively – what are known as meta-analyses.
The studies reported on are newsworthy and there’s certainly some interesting and useful information here. But what’s missing from the piece are key details, including the fact that these drugs can cause significant side effects that may lead some women to stop taking them. Consulting an independent expert may have shed light on this issue for readers.
We also think some of the language used in the story was misleading. The headline focuses the “one-two punch” of using the two types of drugs in combination, but there is no evidence in either meta-analysis to support combining the two drugs. Since that wasn’t an element of the research being reported on, why leap to that in a headline?

Can the person repeat the sentence correctly? T = Time\n\n• If the person shows any of these symptoms, time is important. Call 911 or get to the hospital fast. Brain cells are dying. Source: National Stroke Association CHICAGO \x97 A major study out Monday promises to transform stroke prevention for millions of people with atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder that often sends blood clots swirling to the brain, researchers reported Monday. The study of 14,000 patients found that a new one-a-day pill, rivaroxaban, prevents strokes as effectively as the current mainstay of treatment, Coumadin, without the need for routine testing to monitor patients\' ability to make blood clots and avoid unwanted bleeding, says Robert Califf, of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C. Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 2.3 million people in the USA, and has been linked to a five-fold increase in the risk of lethal strokes. The reason: when a heart goes into atrial fibrillation, its upper chambers quiver rather than contract 60 to 90 times a minute as they\'re supposed to, moving blood through the heart and blood vessels. ""Any time blood sits, it clots,"" says heart rhythm expert Gordon Tomaselli of Johns Hopkins University. Blood clots that travel to the brain may cut off its blood supply, causing a deadly stroke, he says. Coumadin, which inhibits clotting, is so often linked to major bleeding that the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 asked its maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, to notify consumers with a black box warning, FDA\'s strongest safety alert. In addition, patients\' blood levels vary so much from week to week that they must be regularly tested to make sure the drug is inhibiting clots from forming enough to guard against strokes but not so much that patients begin to bleed, Tomaselli says. It may take ""nothing more than a change in someone\'s diet"" — eating more or less green leafy vegetables — to cause the blood levels to rise and fall, Tomaselli says. On Oct. 19, FDA approved another alternative to Coumadin, Boehringer Ingelheim\'s, Pradaxa, a drug that must be taken twice a day and comes in two doses because, at the higher dose, the drug may build up in people with weak kidneys, promoting bleeding. Pradaxa\'s study design wasn\'t as rigorous as rivaroxaban\'s, Califf says. In the rivaroxaban study, patients were divided up into two groups, of about 7,000 patients each. One group was given the experimental drug and the other given warfarin. Unlike the Pradaxa patients, Califf says, those taking rivaroxaban underwent sham monitoring so that neither they, nor their doctors, would know which drug they were on to eliminate any possibility of bias. The patients were unusually elderly for a clinical trial, with a median age of 73 years, and often had histories of previous illnesses. Fifty-five percent in both groups had suffered strokes, researchers reported at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association. The blood levels of patients in the Coumadin group rose and fell so much that they were only in the beneficial range 58% of the time. When the results were tallied, researchers found that the stroke and blood clot rates in both groups were similar, at about 2%. More rivaroxiban patients suffered surface bleeding and had higher transfusion rates, but Coumadin patients had more life-threatening bleeding into crticial organs, Califf says. Peter DiBattiste, of Johnson & Johnson, which developed the drug with Bayer, says the two companies will apply for FDA approval by the end of the year. Elaine Hylek of Boston University, an independent expert who analyzed the trial on behalf of AHA, says the availablity of alternatives for atrial fibrillation will make treatment available to stroke-prone people who can\'t take Coumadin because they don\'t have access to monitoring. Sidney Smith, of the cardiovascular science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said that the new drug is likely to be expensive, so ""we\'re left with a question of cost versus convenience.""

The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.\n\nMost patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer — disease that has spread beyond its original site — initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don’t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.\n\nAD\n\nThe trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer — a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.\n\n“For the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,” she said.\n\nAD\n\nScientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”\n\nRoy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.\n\nAD\n\nLast May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn’t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.\n\nAD\n\nExperts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.\n\nLast week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.\n\nAD\n\nIn a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications — Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb — to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.\n\nAD\n\nThe patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.\n\nHe said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high “tumor mutational burden,” but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.\n\nAD\n\nAnother study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way — for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo — the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation — to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.\n\nAD\n\nNine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a “major pathologic response” — a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.\n\nDrew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD""]","Most significantly, it doesn’t tell us about the $150,000 annual price tag for each patient.","This story is one of two we reviewed about lung cancer immunotherapy studies presented at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting.

The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.\n\nPancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.\n\n""The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,"" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. ""This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.""\n\nThe NanoKnife® IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife® IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.\n\nAbout STAR\n\nSTAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.\n\nFrom July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence.

This reflects our uncertainty as to who should be considered the source of this news. As we’ve discussed in a blog post, the release is worded to suggest that it originated with the University of Louisville, and it includes a University of Louisville media contact. However, that contact has told us, via email and a comment on this review, that the release originated with MCS Healthcare Public Relations, which was working with a member of the University of Louisville faculty. That faculty member, in turn, suggested to us that the release was in fact cleared and sanctioned by the University. The University of Louisville media contact has refused to provide any further clarification. We’re unsure whom to believe, so we’ve deliberately left blank the area where we’d normally indicate the news release source. The fact that we can’t even tell where this news came from should raise questions about the process that produced it.]

And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.\n\n""I was amazed with the results of pRF,"" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. ""Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.""\n\nAnd as a patient himself, Napoli added that ""from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.""\n\nNapoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.\n\nHe and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nLower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient\'s leg.\n\nStandard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.\n\nThe problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.\n\n""Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,"" he noted. And though surgery safety has ""largely improved,"" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.\n\nBy contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.\n\n""The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,"" he explained. ""Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.""\n\nFor the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.\n\nAll the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.\n\nBy the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ""perceived"" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.\n\nDr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.\n\nHe noted that because ""the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,"" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.\n\nStill, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient\'s pain, given that ""the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.""\n\nNevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.\n\n""Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,"" said Park. ""It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers more information on herniated disks.']",It’s too bad those comments don’t appear until the end.,"This story describes research results presented at a radiology meeting that compared treating patients with lower back pain from disk herniation with either a pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) probe or multiple steroid injections.
We also reviewed a news release about this research.
Among the story’s strengths: It alerts readers that the study — presented as an abstract — has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end.
However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence.
It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose.

Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study.\n\n""This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,"" he said.\n\nMen with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (""watchful waiting,"" also known as ""active surveillance"").\n\n""Watchful waiting"" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy).\n\nThe data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported.\n\nThe earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause.\n\nThe researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in ""watchful waiting"" mode.\n\nAfter an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk.\n\nThe benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life.\n\nThere was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics.\n\nMen whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn\'t spread.\n\nRadical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction.\n\nAlso, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said.\n\n""The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,"" Greenberg said.\n\nAlso, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases.\n\nBut much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer.\n\n""The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,"" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study.\n\n""Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,"" Danziger added.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on prostate cancer treatments.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The headline is potentially misleading for readers.  Otherwise this is a reasonably well done story. </span>","As with the NPR and AP stories we also reviewed, this story helped frame this issue in the first few lines rather than burying it at the end as so often is the case. To have an expert not involved in study quoted in the second paragraph saying “findings are not likely to be practice-changing” provides readers with balanced perspective right from the start.  It was also good that the story concluded with a quote that expanded on what it means to “individualize” treatment. Unlike the concluding quote in the NPR story, this one provided language suggestive of shared decision making by adding ‘in relation to the risk stratification of disease, PATIENT DESIRES, health status, and RISK TOLERANCE”. (emphasis added)  Good way to end the story.

The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n“The entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain’s memory mainframe,” Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain’s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n“When we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,” Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIMPACT ON ALZHEIMER’S\n\nIn Alzheimer’s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n“The question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,” he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer’s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was “very excited about the finding,” but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer’s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer’s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n“Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.']",As with the ,"This story does a bit better job than the other one we reviewed of describing electrical brain stimulation treatment as it is used in other types of patients, and pointing out that it is “very invasive.” Still, it could have been more specific about the inherent risks. Like the other story, it misses a chance to compare the results of this experiment to the size of the temporary memory boost provided by available drugs.

It reports the FDA’s approval of a blood test to detect biomarkers associated with brain lesions, which the FDA says will eliminate the need for a CT scan in at least a third of suspected concussions. The story covers cost and availability and usefully points out that this test hasn’t been approved for kids.
But the lead gets it wrong when it says the test is designed to “help detect concussion”; it’s not. The test is designed to detect structural brain injuries that might be picked up by a CT scan, such as skull fractures or bleeding in the brain.
The story also doesn’t address uncertainties with the quality of evidence or potential harms. Finally, it misses an opportunity to educate the public about the need for more judicious use of CT scans, which are not helpful for detecting concussions.

The operation was performed as part of a clinical trial at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\n\nThe surgery is called NOTES -- which stands for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The idea is to use the mouth or vagina as routes to parts of the body requiring surgery. In traditional laparoscopic -- or minimally invasive -- surgery, doctors make several small incisions through the abdominal wall and insert a tiny camera and tools to remove the gallbladder or appendix. That type of surgery is a big improvement upon the long, open incisions that patients used to require.\n\nHowever, NOTES spares patients even the tiny abdominal incisions. Tools are passed down the mouth and through a hole created in the stomach. In the recent surgery, lead investigator Santiago Horgan made two tiny incisions (not requiring stitches) to pass a camera into the abdomen to increase visibility. However, the gallbladder was removed by way of the mouth.\n\nThe procedure was done as part of a study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOTES compared with laparoscopy as well as the pain levels, cosmetic outcome, costs and other outcomes, Horgan said in a news release.

As part of the condition, they also have lower levels of acetylcholine, a chemical which helps us to concentrate - making it extremely difficult to pay attention to walking.\n\n""We already know that rivastigmine works to treat dementia by preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, however our study shows for the first time that it can also improve regularity of walking, speed, and balance.

""This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals.""\n\nGardasil protects against several strains of HPV, which is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men.\n\nUptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don\'t start it at all.\n\nBut study author Anna Giuliano believes that, ""vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you\'re going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect.""\n\nHPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm.\n\nThis study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years.\n\nAmong participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.\n\n""It\'s a similar efficacy to what we\'ve seen in females,"" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.\n\nThe researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it\'s impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers.\n\n""We\'re going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,"" said Giuliano.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on HPV.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story got the same 3-star score as a </span>","The story is amazingly silent on the message that there is controversy about vaccinating young men.

All for about four bucks a bottle.\n\nThose impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making ""false and unsubstantiated"" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads.\n\nA 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nThe FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims.\n\nHealth.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat\n\nNot all of the products were drinks, but ""the beverage category stands out,"" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. ""At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims.""\n\nDrinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. ""The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,"" Silverglade says.\n\nAre the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn\'t require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn\'t mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research.\n\nThe research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support.\n\n""If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,"" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. ""The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we\'re putting our bodies at risk.""\n\nWhere\'s the line between research and marketing?\n\nSounds great, hard to believe\n\nHowever far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company\'s right to free speech.)\n\nBut are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex?\n\nThere seem to be more than a few believers out there. ""\n\nI started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,"" one of POM Wonderful\'s 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. ""Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!"" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what\'s considered normal.)\n\nMost health beverage drinkers aren\'t as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda.\n\n""I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn\'t hurt to drink,"" Ma says. ""Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped.""\n\nHealth.com: You are what you drink\n\nBut the fact is, even when people don\'t buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That\'s the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food.\n\nThat\'s because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like ""antioxidant.""\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a ""health halo,"" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like ""low-fat"" ""all-natural"" or ""made with whole grains"" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example.\n\n""A healthy halo develops around products like these,"" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine\'s senior food and nutrition editor. ""The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they\'re doing a world of good for themselves.""\n\nHealth.com: Food label know-how: 5 mistakes even savvy shoppers make\n\nCeating a health halo\n\nThe makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC\'s complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company\'s claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out.\n\nOne of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months.\n\n""These days it\'s possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,"" says Silverglade.\n\nMichael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in ""very prestigious peer reviewed journals,"" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman.\n\n""A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,"" says Lesser. ""Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product.""\n\nHealth.com: 14 health products you probably don\'t need\n\nIffy health claims don\'t mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. But it\'s ""not going to solve any of your health issues,"" she adds.\n\nThe bottom line is that consumers shouldn\'t believe everything they read on labels. ""If they focus on consuming an overall well-balanced diet, they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises,"" Gans says.\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011']",This Health.com story (not reported by but simply republished by CNN.com) did an excellent job of picking apart the claims made by POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and other beverages that are promoted as health products.,"As the story points out, these claims are usually based on very thin evidence from manufacturer-funded studies. The story also included some good background information on why food manufacturers are so tempted to stretch the truth when making these claims. The short answer is that the claims help sell products even when they are not believable.
We would like to have seen some more details on the studies POM cites in support of its promotional statements. Apart from this and a few other minor shortcomings, however, the story met our expectations for quality journalism.

Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.\n\nEarly diagnosis supports early intervention\n\nCerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.\n\nAlthough most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.\n\nNemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.\n\nIn the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.\n\n""The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,"" said Crowgey. ""If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we\'ll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs."" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.\n\nThe power of data science, analytics and machine learning\n\nThe study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell\'s genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person\'s genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that\'s the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient\'s physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.\n\n""Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person\'s immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,"" said Marsh.\n\nThe approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. ""The data set is massive. It\'s not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,"" said Crowgey.\n\nPromising results, more testing needed\n\nWhile the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.\n\n""We\'re still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we\'re excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,"" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.\n\nAkins was optimistic. ""This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We\'re now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population."" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. ""Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,"" he said.\n\n###\n\nThis research is funded by the Delaware Bioscience Center for Advanced Technology, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, and Nemours.\n\nPull out quote:\n\n""This blood test could be a game changer. The earlier the diagnosis, the earlier we can direct therapies at the child. Specifically, high intensity physical therapy and possibly early surgery to prevent more significant problems in the future, and hopefully improve overall function and quality of life."" M. Wade Shrader, MD, Chief, Cerebral Palsy Center, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children\n\nAbout Nemours Children\'s Health System\n\nNemours is an internationally recognized children\'s health system that owns and operates the two free-standing children\'s hospitals: the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., and Nemours Children\'s Hospital in Orlando, Fla., along with outpatient facilities in six states, delivering pediatric primary, specialty, and urgent care.

The work centers on the early findings of differences in methylation sequences in the DNA that might point out patients with the disease.  The proposed method of genetic testing is still comparatively expensive and the release makes no mention of costs.  The release gives very little numerical data on the outcomes of the research and neglects to address the harm that might arise from false negatives and false positives, even though the release points out the diagnostic accuracy was only 73% in a pilot study involving younger children. This means at least one in four results were wrong.  The release applies the term “breakthrough” in its headline, when it clearly is no such thing, and states unequivocally in the lead that the test works, although it is far too early to make such claims.

The mineral found in popular supplement pills — and in dairy foods, leafy greens and many fortified foods — is unquestionably good for your bones. But in recent years, doctors have raised concerns that calcium supplements might be over-used and bad for hearts.\n\nRecently, two new studies made headlines. One found a link between the supplements and a build-up of calcium in arteries, a possible precursor to heart attacks and strokes.\n\nA second, wider-ranging study found no heart risks and was the basis of new guidelines from two medical groups saying that calcium supplements should be considered heart safe.\n\n“The public has been receiving very confusing and alarming messages about calcium supplements,” says JoAnn Manson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston.\n\nAbout 35% of U.S. adults take calcium supplements, alone or in multivitamins, according to a recent report in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSo here’s what all those people need to know.\n\nConcerns about heart risks may be fading.\n\nOver the past decade, some studies have raised the possibility that calcium, from supplements but not from food, might raise heart risks.\n\nMost recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University tracked nearly 3,000 adults and found that those who took calcium supplements at the study outset were 22% more likely to show artery calcification 10 years later. Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.\n\nAnd its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.\n\n“If you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there’s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,” says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.\n\nThe review “is really reassuring,” says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine. He was not involved in the research.\n\nAlso reassured: The osteoporosis foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, which issued new guidelines saying supplements appear heart safe.\n\nNot everyone is convinced.\n\nThe larger review did not include all potentially relevant studies, says Erin Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology who led the Johns Hopkins study. “I’m still concerned about harm from supplements and I don’t advise them for my patients,” she says.\n\nThere are other reasons not to take calcium supplements.\n\nThe first is that most people don’t need them, Rosen says. Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day — close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.\n\nWhen there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.\n\nSome people do need supplements.\n\nOlder adults with osteoporosis — bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures — can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.\n\nAmong others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.\n\nTeen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.\n\nYour bones need more than calcium alone.\n\nVitamin D — found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure — also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses. Under current U.S. nutrition guidelines, teens and adults are advised to get 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day.\n\nAlso important for bone health: weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, dancing and workouts with weights.']","The story offers guidance to readers about the state of research regarding calcium supplements, providing balanced information they can use to make informed decisions about their health.","The story examines the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of calcium supplements, and discusses two recent studies (found in the Journal of the American Heart Association and the Annals of Internal Medicine) that address the issue.
On the whole, the story is strong: It offers guidance to readers about the state of research regarding calcium supplements, providing balanced information they can use to make informed decisions about their health. Yet, the story would have been stronger if it also had discussed the evidence around taking calcium to prevent osteoporosis-related bone fractures in older women.

Most sleep aids, including Sanofi’s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’ Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.\n\n“These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.\n\nGABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.\n\n“When you hit those, you don’t just hit the sleep system,” John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nSuvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.\n\nOrexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.\n\nFor this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.\n\n“How impaired would they be?” Renger said.\n\nTo test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.\n\nThe team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.\n\nIn the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.\n\n“Are DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,” Mignot wrote.\n\nSo far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.\n\nThe most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.']",Better sleeping pills for rats and monkeys awakened for midnight memory tests. Many questions for people with insomnia.,"This story about a new type of sleeping pill does a better job than the HealthDay story we also reviewed of alerting readers in the first 6 words that it was just an animal experiment. However, there is less independent perspective provided than in the HealthDay story. Both stories make clear that the research was done by the company seeking FDA approval for a similar drug. And like the other story, this one fails to tell readers that this experiment did not test the sort of next-day hangover effect that hits many users of currently available drugs. It is puzzling, too, that neither story asks why these side effect questions apparently were not addressed in the human studies Merck submitted to the FDA.

Orexin is a neuropeptide that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the brain’s sleep/wake process.\n\nThe 254-patient study tested MK-4305 at 10 milligrams, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg against a placebo. The findings were presented at Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn the one-night measure, patients who took the highest dose of the Merck drug slept 12.2 percent more of the eight hours than those who got a placebo. The improvement was 11.6 percent at 40 mg, 6.6 percent at 20 mg and 6.2 percent at the lowest dose.\n\nAfter four weeks, when there tends to be some improvement in the placebo patients, 80 mg patients slept 7.7 percent more, while those who got the 40 mg dose slept 7.9 percent more. At 20 mg the difference was 10.4 percent and at 10 mg, 4.7 percent.\n\nMerck said it has begun separate larger Phase III studies of MK-4305 in elderly and non-elderly insomnia patients and expects to seek approval of the drug in 2012.\n\nThe company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients.\n\n“Forty milligrams looked like best dose on efficacy and tolerability,” said David Michelson, Merck’s vice president for neuroscience clinical research. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need.\n\nPeople with insomnia may have one or more sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep and difficulty getting back to sleep after waking in the night.\n\nPatients who took the 40 mg dose in the trial spent 33 fewer minutes awake after falling asleep than the placebo group at one night and averaged 32 fewer minutes awake at the end of week four.\n\nOn average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.\n\nThere were no reports of serious adverse side effects. The most common side effects included upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, dizziness, drowsiness on waking, headache and vivid dreams.\n\n“We are encouraged by these Phase II results showing positive effects of MK-4305 in patients with primary insomnia,” Michelson said in a statement.']","A story apparently driven by a news release – providing little context, no cost information and a confusing jumble of numbers that leaves readers with  more questions than answers.","Merck must have loved this story – getting nine mentions and getting away claims that were unchallenged by any independent source.

Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nMORE: NFL’s Concussion Research Full of Holes, Report Finds\n\nBut in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they’re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nGet The Brief.

It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan — the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don’t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don’t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they’re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they’re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n“We may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,” she says.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.""]","This story about a new study looking at blood tests to assist in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries and concussions missed the mark by failing to provide important study details, like how many people with brain injuries were correctly identified.","This brief story discusses a new study published in JAMA Neurology about blood tests for two biomarkers that may assist in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries among patients brought to a level-one trauma unit.

However, it missed the mark in some important ways: It didn’t tell us how these biomarkers fared on accuracy, and it lacked independent sources, such as a brain injury or concussion expert who wasn’t connected to the research.

But after treatment, the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around 6.3. In contrast, the control group only showed an average score of around 2.7 after treatment.”']",Reuters joined the media frenzy and reported on a small study that was bound to trigger an avalanche of coverage.,"This story reports on a pilot study that used light boxes, similar to those for treating seasonal affective disorder, to increase flagging sex drive in men. Researchers said exposure to bright light for 30 minutes every morning for two weeks led to higher average testosterone levels and greater average reported levels of sexual satisfaction, possibly due to a series of hormonal affects.
The story appears to rely nearly entirely on the news release and does not mention costs, harms or limitations of the study, which researchers acknowledge was too small to draw clinical conclusions. Overall, the story was too brief to be helpful and as many stories of “new findings” do, shared only positive conclusions.

REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky\n\nMerck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price.\n\nJanuvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin that helps lower blood sugar levels, had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet\n\nOn the study’s main focus, after about three years 11.4 percent of Januvia patients had experienced cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina versus 11.6 percent in the placebo group.\n\nThe detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n“We can be reassured we can use this drug for glucose lowering without affecting the already high cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes,” said Professor Rury Holman, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.\n\n“For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added.\n\nThere was also no significant difference between Januvia and placebo in infections, cancer, kidney failure or severe hypoglycemia, which is dangerously low blood sugar, researchers reported.\n\nAcute pancreatitis, a concern with some diabetes drugs, was uncommon but higher with Januvia, 23 versus 12. That was not statistically significant.\n\n“Numerically this is hardly a major risk, just something we need to keep an eye on,” Holman said.\n\nPancreatic cancers, also uncommon, were numerically fewer with Januvia, 9 versus 14.\n\nDeath from any cause occurred in 7.5 percent of Januvia patients versus 7.3 percent for placebo.\n\nThe Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.']","This story missed the mark on explaining the benefits, the costs, and the conflicts of interest when covering a study about a diabetes drug.","While this story is in some respects exemplary in its coverage of a study on Januvia, a blockbuster diabetes drug, we think it missed the big picture. A full explanation of this research would have required a little more space and a lot more context than this story provided. To know whether Januvia is worth the potential risks associated with taking it, the story would have had to provide more information on the relative benefits of the drug versus other therapies, the costs of the drug in comparison to other therapies, and a more thorough analysis of the quality of the evidence in the study and perhaps other studies related to the drug. The story provides none of this information. It does provide a fairly good discussion of the risks associated with the drug — at least according to this study — but without that additional information, those risk comparisons are at best of little use and at worst highly misleading.

Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).\n\nYet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.\n\nFor years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they’ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nAn FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug’s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency’s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA’s final answer would be a very predictable no.\n\nIf they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there’s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins—and the company that produces the drug—are hoping will happen again.\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin\n\nFalling Behind\n\n“It started out so innocent,” his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. “When he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.” Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. “When other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn’t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.”\n\nWhen Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. “Before we started living this life, I was clueless,” she said.\n\nDMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.\n\nMax’s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. “I feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,” she said.\n\nBut the family’s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she’d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.\n\nGenetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty’s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.\n\n“I felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,” she said. “It was the hardest 18 months I’ve ever had and I hope I ever had.”\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook\n\nStill Walking\n\nDMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.\n\nThe Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn’t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug’s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin’s children have.\n\nThe Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.\n\nAtaluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein—as if someone spray-painted the word “don’t” on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company’s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)\n\nRegardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.\n\nMax is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school’s band. “He’s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,” Betty said.\n\nFor that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.\n\n“His life is—it’s not like his peers, but he’s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,” she said. “He’s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis—I didn’t know what it would look like for him. I didn’t expect it to look like this.”\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin\n\nBut not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug—with good reason. The clinical trial results haven\'t been great. Most of the company’s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.\n\nThe FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, “this drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.”\n\nPTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA’s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)\n\nA Million Dollar Issue\n\nPart of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn\'t happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works—at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.\n\nPTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren\'t a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn’t measure up in that way, he says, “doesn’t mean the drug is not effective.”\n\nBut even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.\n\n“If the evidence isn’t good, then insurance companies won’t pay for [drugs],” said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about £220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.\n\nThe NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization’s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and ""not clinically significant.""\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA’s decisions are all “based on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.” That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.\n\nCourtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook\n\nTo Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren’t easily quantified. Rowan’s gait seems better. Max still doesn’t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.\n\nHowever, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren’s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.\n\nThe FDA hasn’t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. “I’m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],” she said. Will they have access to the drug if it’s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn’t? What other options do they have?\n\nBetty has no good answers. She is hoping she won’t need to come up with them.\n\n“DMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,” Vertin said. “If we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that’s huge.”\n\nSaveSave']","Given the vividness of anecdotal accounts, the research details in a story like this must be a dominant and detailed part of the story.","This story focuses on a family tragedy—three young boys in a single family with a fatal genetic disorder called Duchenne muscular dystrophy—and the family’s hope that an experimental drug, which the three boys have been taking as part of a clinical trial, will receive FDA approval later this month.
The story is filled with emotional freight, pitting anecdotal evidence (the mother’s reflection on her sons’ vigor, which she attributes to the drug) against systematic evidence that that finds little in the way of robust benefits. While such a story offers readers a compelling look at the sometimes anguished process of clinical research in the face of a lethal disease, it gives too short shrift to the clinical research evidence available here. On the other hand, the story did a great job explaining the costs and insurance hurdles around drugs like this, as well as the possible mechanisms behind how this drug and similar ones work.

WOULD YOUR BONES PASS THE BMD TEST? Those initials stand for bone mineral density. The lower your BMD, the more likely you are to break bones, especially in old age. To screen for osteoporosis (low bone mineral density), doctors usually use a DXA, or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, machine. It scans your hip, spine or forearm with a very low dose of radiation. The tests are recommended for people who have a high risk for bone loss, including women over 65. Routine use in men is under debate, although it is recommended by some groups. For more information, visit nof.org. HEALTH COLUMNIST TWEETS HEALTH COLUMNIST TWEETS HAVE A HEALTH OR MEDICAL QUESTION? HAVE A HEALTH OR MEDICAL QUESTION? E-mail kpainter@usatoday.com. Please include your name, city and daytime phone number. Selected questions will be answered in the paper and online. Asked to name a health problem that affects one in five men, few people might think of osteoporosis. That\'s because the bone-loss disorder strikes many more women, one in two over a lifetime. Women, on average, have smaller skeletons. As they age, they lose bone mass earlier and faster. ""It\'s always been viewed as a disease of women,"" says Amir Qaseem, a physician who directs a research and education program at the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia. ""But it\'s a very important public health issue for men, too. It\'s under-diagnosed and undertreated."" But exactly how to find and help men whose bones are thinning — which increases their risk for broken hips and other fractures — is controversial for one reason: Men\'s bones aren\'t studied much. This month, that lack of research led an influential group to pass up a chance to recommend osteoporosis screening for men. In a draft statement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said, ""Surrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harm"" of asking millions of men to take bone measurement tests — and asking the health care system to invest in more bone-scanning machines and bone-building drugs for those men. The group did update its recommendations for women, saying all women over 65 and certain younger women should be screened. (The draft recommendations are open to public comment until Aug. 3 at ahrq.gov/clinic/draftix.htm). Help that\'s too little, too late But men should take note: Qaseem\'s group and the National Osteoporosis Foundation have looked at the same sparse research and decided to recommend bone scans for men at high risk, including those older than 65 or 70. The scans do detect bone loss in men. What\'s not known is whether prescribing drugs and other treatments to men with low scores will stop them from breaking bones. But data do point in that direction, says foundation president Robert Recker . Right now, men often get too little help, too late, he says. Recker, a physician at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, says he sees too many men like the fiftysomething laborer who came to his office recently after many months of severe back pain. He had undiagnosed osteoporosis. Six percent of all men over 50 are destined to break a hip, says the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. And studies show that when they do, they are more likely than women to die or require long-term care. That may be because the men are in worse health to begin with, says Eric Orwoll, a bone-health specialist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. In any case, he says, men should know that if they break any bone after age 50, they are at high risk for breaking another and should be evaluated for osteoporosis. Other risk factors include: • Low body weight. Thin men, just like thin women, are at higher risk. • A family history of osteoporosis. • Smoking, heavy drinking and diets low in calcium and vitamin D. • Certain medications, including glucocorticoids. • Certain conditions, including low testosterone.

The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients’ consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\n\nThis approach — called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes — has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states.\n\nEach participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.\n\nThe team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state — and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. “And when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.”\n\nDr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. “Each seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren’t attached to anything,” Dr. Greenblatt said.']","This research is a step forward in the field, but it’s a long way from what doctors call “clinical applicability”–meaning that it has been proven safe and effective.","This New York Times story describes research that may, in the future, lead to technologies that may help people with memory problems, such as those who have had a traumatic brain injury. Although the technique of brain stimulation has been used before to try to enhance memory function, sometimes it has been found to help and other times to hinder remembering. The current study shows that timing of the stimulation is possibly important, and tends to help memory when “people are in a low or foggy state,” while hindering it otherwise.
The story’s headline misrepresents the findings–at this point, we’re far from knowing if this “pacemaker for the brain” can indeed help memory among people with traumatic brain injury, dementia or other diseases. It also needed more on the cost of brain implant surgery, and the risks associated with the devices and their installation.

Proponents of screening argued that the study is the largest ever conducted and provides strong support for guidelines of the American Cancer Society and other groups calling for regular screening of women in this age group. But critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading. A major criticism of the study was that it made no attempt to weigh the risks of mammography against the benefits.\n\n\n\nLast November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which was established in 1986 to assess the value of preventive medical techniques, concluded that mammography for women in their 40s was probably not a good idea. The panel concluded that screening could reduce the risk of dying by about 15% among women in their 40s. But the risks of false positives and invasive procedures associated with them largely outweighed the potential benefits of the procedure. The costs are also high, the panel concluded. About 1,900 women in their 40s would have to be screened to save one life, the panel concluded, and that is a poor return on investment. In contrast, for women over 50, about 1,300 need to be screened to save one life.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a study from Norway concluded that the routine mammography may not even be all that beneficial for women older than 50. Those researchers found that improvements in breast cancer awareness and new treatments for the disease were the prime drivers in reducing the death rate from breast cancer and that routine mammography may contribute as little as 2% to the reduction.\n\n\n\nThe new study was released at a news conference and published online in the journal Cancer on Wednesday and is to be presented Friday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s Breast Cancer Symposium in Alexandria, Va. Epidemiologist Hakan Jonsson of Umea University in Sweden and his colleagues took advantage of the fact that, since 1986, about half of Sweden\'s counties have offered routine mammography to women in their 40s and half have not. Using a cancer registry, the team examined records for more than a million women in the two groups of counties. They found 619 breast cancer deaths among women in the counties that offered screening, compared with 1,205 deaths in a similar group that were not screened. Overall follow-up was about 16 years. That amounted to a 26% reduction in deaths among women who were offered screening and a 29% reduction among those who actually received mammograms. The authors said that 1,250 women needed to be screened to prevent one death.\n\n\n\nCritics, however, noted that the researchers did not provide mortality rates, which made it difficult to compare the results in the two groups of counties. Moreover, they counted only the women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer and died of it but did not compare the broader cancer death rates in the two groups. Some studies have previously shown, for example, that breast cancer rates were significantly lower in the counties where screening is now performed even before the start of the screening program, suggesting that women in those counties may be intrinsically healthier. And the researchers did not look at false positives or other adverse outcomes from the screenings.\n\n\n\nThe controversy over mammograms seems unlikely to be settled anytime soon. Until it is, perhaps the best advice for a woman comes from Dr. Jennifer C. Obel of the NorthShore University HealthSystem in Chicago, who serves as a spokeswoman for the oncology society: ""The critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best"" for them.\n\n\n\n-- Thomas H. Maugh II / Los Angeles Times\n\n\n\n']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">In the first paragraph the story included the perspective of critics who ""charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading"" and that it ""made no attempt to weigh the risks of mammography against the benefits.""  Essential emphasis and placement. But why weren’t the critics named? </span>","


 
This story about a study of mammography in Swedish women in their 40s puts the findings in the context of other recent reports and highlights the critiques of independent experts, thus helping readers to see that this is just one more piece of the puzzle. By including the number of women that needed to be screened in order to prevent one breast cancer death, the story gives readers a more realistic perspective on the percentage difference in death rates the researchers saw between areas that screened younger women and those that did not.

This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science\'s partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.\n\n""This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient\'s life,"" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. ""During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient\'s cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.""\n\nThis blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.\n\n""We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,"" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. ""In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient\'s outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.""\n\nThis is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.\n\nIn March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test.\n\nThe paper is entitled, ""Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.""\n\nAbout the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ Test\n\nDesigned by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences\' No Cell Left Behind® platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy.

Then, they isolated the white blood cells from each donor and studied inflammatory cell levels and the effect marijuana had on the cells.\n\n“The patients who didn’t smoke marijuana had a very high level of inflammatory cells compared to those who did use,” Kaminski said. “In fact, those who used marijuana had levels pretty close to a healthy person not infected with HIV.”\n\nKaminski, director of MSU’s Institute for Integrative Toxicology, has studied the effects of marijuana on the immune system since 1990. His lab was the first to identify the proteins that can bind marijuana compounds on the surface of immune cells. Up until then, it was unclear how these compounds, also known as cannabinoids, affected the immune system.\n\nHIV, which stands for human immunodeficiency virus, infects and can destroy or change the functions of immune cells that defend the body. With antiretroviral therapy – a standard form of treatment that includes a cocktail of drugs to ward off the virus – these cells have a better chance of staying intact.\n\nYet, even with this therapy, certain white blood cells can still be overly stimulated and eventually become inflammatory.\n\n“We’ll continue investigating these cells and how they interact and cause inflammation specifically in the brain,” Rizzo said. “What we learn from this could also have implications to other brain-related diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s since the same inflammatory cells have been found to be involved.”\n\nKnowing more about this interaction could ultimately lead to new therapeutic agents that could help HIV patients specifically maintain their mental function.\n\n“It might not be people smoking marijuana,” Kaminski said. “It might be people taking a pill that has some of the key compounds found in the marijuana plant that could help.”\n\n###\n\nMichigan State University has been working to advance the common good in uncommon ways for more than 150 years. One of the top research universities in the world, MSU focuses its vast resources on creating solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges, while providing life-changing opportunities to a diverse and inclusive academic community through more than 200 programs of study in 17 degree-granting colleges.']",Pot for thought? How about a better explanation of the science before we send HIV patients to the green pharmacy.,"Marijuana’s health benefits are widely touted but poorly understood. This release does little to add to the evidence. The health claim made in the headline has little to do with what was evaluated in the published study. There is no true quantification of the benefits of marijuana as a therapy for preserving cognitive function in AIDS patients, no context about the risks associated with smoking marijuana, no comparison to alternatives, no mention of costs, and not much in the way of explaining the strength of the study in question. This is especially problematic when it comes to marijuana. Like chocolate, marijuana is something that is often heralded for its health benefits, often with questionable findings underpinning the claims.

Chan School of Public Health suggest that long-term, high intake of vegetable protein from such foods as whole grains, soy and tofu, may protect women from early menopause and could prolong reproductive function.\n\nConsuming enriched pasta, dark bread and cold cereal were especially associated with lower risk, while they observed no similar relation to eating animal sources of protein.\n\n""A better understanding of how dietary vegetable protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify ways for women to modify their risk of early onset menopause and associated health conditions,"" write first author and then-graduate student Maegan Boutot, with her advisor, professor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson. Details appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nEarly menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45, affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline, the authors note. Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.\n\nBoutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses\' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.\n\nParticipants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from ""never or less than once a month"" to ""6+ per day."" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.\n\nFor a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson add, ""Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)"" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.\n\nOthers on the study team were from Brigham and Women\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH\'s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nFor the NHS2, follow-up questionnaires have assessed nurses\' lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions every two years. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.\n\nBoutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.\n\n###']",We wish news releases based on observational studies were more upfront about limitations when describing the research. Adding a descriptor such as “these are useful findings that need further study” in a prominent place would help.," This news release reports on a study showing an association between eating plant protein and lower risk of early menopause. Researchers evaluated data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, a large-scale effort to identify risk factors of disease in women. The study appeared in the Journal of American Epidemiology. A sub-headline allows that the effect is “modest” but the news release headline implies a cause-and-effect relationship that can’t be proven with one study based on observing a sample group of people, particularly when the group is self-reporting and subject to errors in recall.
We have some tips on ways to write headlines for diet and observational studies in general that avoid the suggestion of cause and effect.

The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.\n\nFurthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.\n\nThe findings suggest that women\'s bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State\'s Food Innovation Center.\n\n""This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,"" Orchard said. ""I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.""\n\nBecause the study was observational, it\'s not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.\n\nRebecca Jackson, the study\'s senior author and director of Ohio State\'s Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.\n\n""By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women\'s health and lifestyle choices,"" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women\'s Health Initiative steering committee.\n\nPrevious studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they\'d find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.\n\nThe Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women\'s Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women\'s health undertaken in U.S. history.\n\nParticipants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.\n\nFor the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.\n\nThe researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.\n\nOrchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.\n\n""This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,"" the researchers wrote.\n\nBut in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.\n\nWomen with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.\n\n""These women with healthier diets didn\'t lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,"" Orchard said.\n\n###\n\nVedat Yildiz of Ohio State\'s Center for Biostatistics also worked on the study, which was supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCONTACT: Tonya Orchard, 614-292-7241; Orchard.6@osu.edu']",A mention of specific diets or foods and numbers illustrating the actual benefits would have made the release even better.,"This news release describes the results of an observational study that looked at the association of a scoring system called the dietary inflammatory index (DII), which aims to measure the inflammatory potential of certain foods, with risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women. Researchers also looked at changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and compared them with DII scores. Over 160,000 women completed food frequency questionnaires at baseline and then again 3 years later, and information on bone fractures was reported at least every year. A smaller group of women (about 10,000) also had a procedure that measured their bone mineral density (BMD), which is an important factor in risk for osteoporosis and fractures.
Overall, the study did not find an association between a diet higher in inflammatory foods (based on the DII) and fracture risk. However, a higher DII score was associated with increased risk for hip fracture — but only in White women younger than 63 years. Women with the least inflammatory DII scores had less loss of hip BMD despite having a lower BMD at the start of the study, when compared with women that had the most inflammatory DII scores.
This release places the research into context for readers and provides important cautions about the observational and retrospective nature of the study design. Its language is measured, and it takes care not to hype the findings. We also liked how the release references a positive finding from a subgroup of the study without presenting the finding as if it were the main result. The release would have been improved with the addition of some measurement of benefits and some mention of the costs associated with a diet that would potentially lead to fewer bone density problems in older age.

Neither did psychotherapy.\n\nThen she agreed to a transcranial magnetic stimulation. The new treatment pushes powerful magnetic currents into the front of the brain, the part that controls emotions.\n\nThese days, Bruce awakens before her alarm goes off and dives into projects, including monster tasks she once dreaded.\n\n""I have a room in my house in which I had stacked boxes from when we moved 10 years ago that I wanted to get to, but I couldn\'t do it,"" the Centerville woman said. ""But I\'ve been working on that.""\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation, once considered an experimental treatment for depression, is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago. Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed. This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.\n\nDoctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It\'s an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.\n\nThe cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.\n\n""We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,"" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.\n\nThe NeuroStar system resembles a dentist\'s chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm — a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.\n\n""When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,"" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.\n\nDr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.\n\n""Most people are not scared of it,"" she said. ""It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You\'ve got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You\'ve got less side effects than taking a medicine.""\n\nBoth Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a ""significant effect of treatment"" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a ""sham"" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.\n\nDepressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.\n\nHowever, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare\'s medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.\n\n""Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,"" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. ""Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.""\n\nCochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider. West is a Medicare provider.\n\nSaid West: ""Typically, when Medicare starts to cover something the excuse of experimental and investigational is no longer valid.""']","An incomplete and overly optimistic story about a new and potentially useful treatment option.

It may have a big impact on public health without requiring complicated counting of calories or nutrients.”\n\nWomen who fasted for longer periods of time overnight had significantly better control over blood glucose concentrations. The data shows that each three hour increase in nighttime fasting was associated with a 4 percent lower postprandial glucose level, regardless of how much women ate.\n\n“The dietary advice for cancer prevention usually focuses on limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods,” said co-author Ruth Patterson, PhD, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center associate director for population sciences and program leader of the cancer prevention program. “New evidence suggests that when and how often people eat can also play a role in cancer risk.”\n\nWomen in the study reported eating five times per day with a mean nighttime fasting of 12 hours. Those who reported longer fast durations also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day, ate fewer calories after 10 p.m. and had fewer eating episodes.\n\nResearchers recommend large-scale clinical trials to confirm that nighttime fasting results in favorable changes to biomarkers of glycemic control and breast cancer risk.\n\nCo-authors include Loki Natarajan, Dorothy Sears and Sheri Hartman of UC San Diego; and Linda Gallo and Elva Arredondo of San Diego State University.\n\nFunding for this research came, in part, from the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Ruth L.

It appears the study merely hypothesized that the benefits of fasting may be associated with breast cancer reduction, but this hypothesis was not directly tested by the researchers.

It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.\n\nThe most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.\n\nThe 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.\n\nThe women were classified into three groups as the study began: ""marginal"", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; ""mastectomy-only"", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and ""inoperable"", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.\n\nAfter the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.\n\nMore than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.\n\nThe investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n""Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,"" study chair Dr. Matthey J. Ellis, a breast cancer specialist at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, said in a news release. ""These results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen-lowering agents before surgery.""\n\nThe findings are scheduled to be presented June 7 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on surgical options for breast cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.']",HealthDay seems to have outsourced this story to a publicity team from either the American Society of Clinical Oncology or a St. Louis medical center where the research in question is from.  Journalism? ,"The story has the same basic content and quotes as this press release put out by the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University four days before the HealthDay piece.

She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. “I’m done with this shit,” she remembers saying. “I’m done with you guys bullying us.”\n\nThen, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors’ orders. “Listen: Here’s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn’t give it to him, he would relapse and die.”\n\nTech & Science Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek Tech & Science delivered to your inbox\n\nBut Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive—thriving, in fact—even though he’d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That’s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director—whom by then she knew by first name—to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son’s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children’s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon’s case for this story.)\n\nLandon’s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that’s any parent’s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders.\n\nRELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong\n\nIn January 2013, nearly four months after Landon’s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism—especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle’s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.\n\nBy the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon’s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two—which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan—were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.\n\nA Key in the Lock\n\nAs laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.\n\nWhen Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis—cannabinoids—have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn’t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn’t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nThe findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors—primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. “It’s like a key in the lock,” says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. “When compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.”\n\nFurther studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. “Combined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,” he says.\n\nRiddle isn’t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon’s cancer, it’s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It’s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he’ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.\n\n‘He’s Dying’\n\nRiddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren’t sure they could save his life.\n\nShe knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells.\n\nThis aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.\n\nWithin the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment—narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. “The sad thing is they didn’t seem to help Landon,” she says. “At this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, ‘He’s dying. It’s very apparent that he’s dying.’”\n\nLandon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a “little psychopath,” says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. “The chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,” he says.\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nMost children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon’s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse—an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.\n\nA plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle’s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte’s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.\n\nThe Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the psychoactive chemical in the plant—and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. “It was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,” Stanley says of Landon. “He also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call ‘chemo brain.’ He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.” Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.\n\nRELATED: Personalized cancer vaccines edge closer after success in human clinical trials\n\nNearly all of the children the brothers had worked with by then were refractory epilepsy patients. The Stanleys had gotten their start a few years before with adults who wanted to manage cancer, and Landon was their first pediatric cancer patient.\n\nRiddle began her son on Charlotte’s Web CBD oil and eventually added THC. As Riddle titrated the THC dosing, she slowly weaned her son off the narcotics prescribed for him by his doctors in Utah. Stanley says the combination of CBD oil and THC helped Landon deal with the side effects of chemotherapy and, based on limited existing lab research, made it more likely that the cannabis could kill the cancer as well. “If the cannabinoids do in his body what they have proven to do in petri dishes and in mice, why not throw the book at them?”\n\nRyan David Brown for Newsweek\n\nBy then, CNN had started to follow Landon’s story. The network planned to broadcast the segment after he and his mother had returned to Utah, packed up their car with their possessions and drove to their new home in Colorado, where Landon could continue to take cannabis. But CNN aired a promotion for the premiere of the episode before they had left for Colorado. The oncologist at the hospital in Utah who oversaw Landon’s treatment granted them discharge anyway and told Riddle she better leave the state immediately.\n\nRiddle says she was shocked to find that the doctors at the children’s hospital in Denver weren’t on her side. She says the hospital called CPS on her more than a dozen times when it became aware that she was no longer complying with treatment.\n\nThat is why she ended up in that conference room with a cannabis researcher, who was there to explain why the drug could help patients like Landon. He was the only person in the medical field she could find who would speak on her behalf. “It was a big slap in the face that not a single doctor would come forward to help us,” she says. “They were all afraid of losing their medical license. They were afraid of the government. They were afraid of what it would look like if they came forward in the name of cannabis.”\n\nIn the end, CPS supported Riddle. Results from blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy and spinal tap proved Landon no longer had leukemia, not even the microscopic kind, she says. Riddle says the CPS director called the hospital and ordered it to have Landon’s chemo port removed and discharge him from the hospital.\n\nToday, Landon is still coping with the impact of his treatment. In addition to digestive problems, he has post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. The cannabis vape pen helps with that, says Riddle. She says the cranial radiation he had to endure caused some neurological deficits, and Landon says he worries that he’ll be sick forever.\n\nBut there’s so much good news here. He’s alive, and he and his mother are no longer just “medical marijuana refugees.” They’re also activists. Along with other parents, she helped draft a bill and pass a state law that allows Landon and other children like him with chronic illnesses to take cannabis at school. (Since the drug is federally illegal, it had been illegal at school. That’s no longer the case in Colorado.)\n\nThey’ve testified in California on behalf of a medical marijuana caregiver whose home was raided by the federal government, helping the man avoid a 35-year jail sentence.

Nevertheless, many readers will get the impression that the oil was responsible for the patient’s cancer remission and improvement in quality of life. The story could have more clearly pointed out that this child’s improved health might have simply been a consequence of receiving the standard treatment when he was first diagnosed.
We also take issue with the headline. It’s misleading and irresponsible to propose to parents of children with harrowing illnesses that medical marijuana is “the answer” to cancer. As the story explains, we’re nowhere near knowing if this is the case–or not.

These researchers also found that most antidepressant medications have been linked to weight gain.\n\nPrior research on antidepressants and weight change was limited to one year or shorter. But many people take antidepressants--the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States--for longer than a year. So for up to two years the new study followed more than 5,000 Group Health patients who started taking an antidepressant. The Journal of Clinical Medicine published it: ""Long-Term Weight Change after Initiating Second-Generation Antidepressants.""\n\n""Our study suggests that bupropion is the best initial choice of antidepressant for the vast majority of Americans who have depression and are overweight or obese,"" said study leader David Arterburn, MD, MPH. He\'s a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), a Group Health physician, and an affiliate associate professor in the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine\'s Department of Medicine. But in some cases, an overweight or obese patient has reasons why bupropion is not for them--like a history of seizure disorder--and it would be better for them to choose a different treatment option.\n\nStudy findings\n\n""We found that bupropion is the only antidepressant that tends to be linked to weight loss over two years,"" Dr. Arterburn said. ""All other antidepressants are linked to varying degrees of weight gain.""\n\nAfter two years, nonsmokers lost an average of 2.4 pounds on bupropion--compared with gaining an average of 4.6 pounds on fluoxetine (Prozac). So those who took bupropion ended up weighing 7 pounds less than did those on fluoxetine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that difference wasn\'t seen in people who smoked tobacco. Bupropion is often used to help patients stop smoking. So smokers who take bupropion are likely to be trying to quit--and coping with the weight gain that often accompanies attempts to quit smoking.\n\nWho should try which antidepressant?\n\n""A large body of evidence indicates no difference in how effectively the newer antidepressants improve people\'s moods,"" said Dr. Arterburn\'s coauthor Gregory Simon, MD, MPH, a Group Health psychiatrist, GHRI senior investigator, and research professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UW School of Medicine. ""So it makes sense for doctors and patients to choose antidepressants on the basis of their side effects, costs, and patients\' preferences--and, now, on whether patients are overweight or obese.""\n\nBupropion should be considered the first-line drug of choice for people who are overweight or obese, Dr. Simon said. But patients should consult their doctor about which medication is right for them, before making any changes, including starting, switching, or stopping medication.\n\n###\n\nGrant R01 MH083671 from the National Institute of Mental Health funded this research.\n\nDrs.

The results of the study suggest that compared to a “reference” drug, fluoxetine (best known as Prozac), an SSRI or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, only bupropion (marketed as Wellbutrin), an NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) was associated with modest long-term weight loss and only in non-smokers.

Without intervention, 80 to 90 percent of infants who are born to mothers infected with hepatitis B develop a chronic infection. The current standard of care is to provide vaccine and immune globulin to reduce transmission rates.\n\n“Preventing mother-to-child transmission is the most effective way to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis B infection and liver cancer,” says Calvin Pan, MD, lead author of the study and a clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone. “We believe that these findings will not only save many lives, but could also help to eradicate hepatitis B nationally and abroad.”\n\nThe study was conducted in five locations in China, where HBV infection is endemic. Pan and colleagues enrolled 200 pregnant women with a high “viral load,” defined as one million copies of the virus per milliliter in a blood sample. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no antiviral therapy, or to a second group that received a daily dose of 300 milligrams of tenofovir in pill form, beginning at 30 or 32 weeks of pregnancy and continuing until 4 weeks after delivery.\n\nTreatment effectively reduced the viral load of the pregnant women, says Pan. Before delivery, 68 percent of tenofovir-treated mothers had HBV loads below 1 million copies per milliliter, compared to 2 percent of nontreated mothers.\n\nIn terms of safety, researchers found that tenofovir was well tolerated; only one participant treated with tenofovir voluntarily withdrew from the study due to nausea. Among the children born during the study, Pan and his colleagues found no significant differences between the tenofovir-treated group and the control group with regard to fetal development and infant growth.\n\n“This study provides strong evidence on how best to care for women infected with hepatitis B during pregnancy and reduce the rate of disease transmission,” says Mark Pochapin, MD, the Sholtz/Leeds Professor of Gastroenterology and director of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at NYU Langone.\n\nBased on the findings, the investigators recommend that women be tested for HBV viral load at week 28 of pregnancy. Those with a high viral load should receive tenofovir treatment starting at gestational week 30 until delivery to reduce the risk of transmission to their infants. In addition, infants should receive hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin. Moving forward, longer term, observational studies are needed to confirm the safety of fetal exposure to tenofovir treatment, says Pan.\n\nThis research was supported by Gilead Sciences.\n\nDr. Pan’s co-authors were Zhong Ping Duan at Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, in Beijing; Er Hei Dai and Bao Shen Zhu at Fifth Hospital of Shijiazhuang, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang; Shu Qing Zhang and Wen Jing Zhao at Hepatobiliary Disease Hospital of Ji Lin Province, Changchun; Guo-Rong Han and Hong-Xiu Jiang at Second Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing; Yuming Wang at Institute for Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing; Huai Bin Zou at Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing; and Huai Hong Zhang at Nanyang Center Hospital, Nanyang, Henan, all for the China Study Group for the Mother-to-Child Transmission of Hepatitis B.\n\nMedia Inquiries\n\nRob Magyar\n\nPhone: 212-404-3591\n\nrobert.magyar@nyumc.org']",Otherwise carefully written release on hepatitis B treatment omitted cost,"This news release describes a clinical trial testing whether an antiviral drug given to pregnant women in their third trimester reduces their hepatitis B viral load. The study also examined whether the drug limits the transmission of the virus from mother to baby. The answers to both questions are yes, suggesting a new strategy for dealing with the spread of this disease.
The release does a good job describing harms, quantifying benefits and describing the study protocol. Because the cost of hepatitis drugs has been widely debated for the past few years, a mention of the drug’s cost would have made the release stronger.

The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\n\nEarlier studies have found that women taking bisphosphonates have a lower risk of breast cancer. But it was unclear if that effect could be chalked up to the drugs, because the condition they are meant to treat — bone thinning, or osteoporosis — is tied to low estrogen levels, which also cuts breast cancer risk.\n\nColon cancer, on the other hand, has not been linked to estrogen, said Dr. Gad Rennert of the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, whose findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nHis team found that women who had been taking bisphosphonates — mainly the drug alendronate (Fosamax), which costs around $10 per month in the U.S. — for at least a year had a considerably lower risk of developing colon cancer later on.\n\nEven after considering other factors tied to the disease — like aspirin or statin use and eating lots of vegetables — their risk was 59 percent lower than that of women who hadn’t taken the drugs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in 19 men develops colorectal cancer at some point, and slightly fewer women do. The disease is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.\n\nRennert said in an e-mail that alendronate is used by millions of women across the globe and has few side effects. The long-term effects are less well-known, however, and in rare cases it can cause bone death of the jaw, which would be important if healthy people were to take it.\n\nAlso, not all patients asked to participate in the study agreed, which could limit the results further.\n\nJacobs of the American Cancer Society added that one earlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\n\n“Based on current evidence, bisphosphonates should not be used for prevention of colorectal cancer,” Jacobs said. “Fortunately, there are proven ways to help prevent colorectal cancer. In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.”\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/aaGhWR Journal of Clinical Oncology, online February 14, 2011.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The difference between this story and the <a href=""https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review.html?review_id=3634"" target=""_blank"">HealthDay story</a> we reviewed on the same topic can be see in the first quotes each story chose. This one led with caution, the other not so much. </span>","Reuters Health quoted Eric Jacobs from the American Cancer Society saying, “The lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing….However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies.” From that point on, the story took a cautious, objective look at the study’s findings. The HealthDay story, by contrast, quoted Dr. Gad Rennert, the study’s lead author, sounding effusive: “These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers. … This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins.” From there on, Rennert is allowed to pump up the benefits of these drugs and to sweep aside any concern about their risks or broad application to a large population. The HealthDay story did hit some of our marks, too, but, overall, Reuters Health did a better job putting this study in the proper context. In addition, you can’t judge the stories by their headlines. The Reuters headline, “Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer” is not an accurate overview of the study’s finding. The HealthDay story’s headline gets in right, “Popular bone drugs linked to reduced colon cancer risk.”

Such a treatment has been long sought.\n\nEven better, the newest one would appear unlikely to cost $690 a dose — unless drug makers are slow learners.\n\nFederal researchers, working with colleagues at 44 medical centers, found that administering vaginal progesterone to women with a short cervix — a risk factor for premature delivery — cuts the rate of delivering before 33 weeks by 45%.\n\nThe reduction applies only to women with a short cervix (between 1 centimeter and 2 centimeters), not for women at high risk for other reasons. But for these women, few medications have been found effective at keeping a baby in the womb longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysicians led by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., assigned 458 women with a short cervix to receive daily applications of either a progesterone gel or a placebo gel between the 19th and 23rd weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFewer women who got the progesterone treatment delivered early—8.9% versus 16.1% in the placebo group, the team reported online in the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nFurther, there were indications the hormone might help the babies too. Fewer babies born to mothers given progesterone had respiratory distress syndrome, a lung disorder common to premature infants (3% versus 7.6%).\n\nThe data set isn’t very large: 21 of 235 women given progesterone delivered early compared with 36 of 223 women given a placebo. And, of course, the trial was funded by the maker of the progesterone gel, to be marketed as Prochieve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut giving progesterone gel to 14 women with short cervical length would appear to prevent one premature birth, and a progesterone gel the company already sells, Crinone, is FDA approved for women in some fertility treatments. The researchers used about $20 worth of the 8% strength of Crinone in each dose.\n\nThus, the findings are promising, especially when few drugs can keep a pregnant woman from delivering early.\n\nOne new drug, also progesterone-based, is marketed for women who have already had a spontaneous preterm birth. That drug, Makena, was the subject of considerable controversy recently after its manufacturer boosted the price from $20 per dose to $1,500 per dose before finally lowering it to $690.

Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.\n\n“If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author.\n\nAlzheimer’s research has faced a number of major setbacks – most recently the failure of Eli Lily’s drug trial – after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.\n\nThe latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.\n\nThe study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer’s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.\n\n\n\nTo restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.\n\n\n\nAfter an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells.\n\nIn a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer’s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.\n\nNext, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be “not offensive at all” for a person to have in the background.\n\nAfter being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.\n\nEd Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “I was surprised, and it’s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.”\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.\n\nDavid Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer’s.”\n\nThe authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs. Tsai and Ed Boyden, a colleague at MIT and co-author, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans.\n\nThere are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain and this figure is expected to reach 1 million by 2025. Earlier this year, dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales.']","This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications.","This story describes a study in which genetically engineered mice were exposed to an hour of pulsing light daily for a week, with the result that certain toxins associated with Alzheimer’s disease were dramatically reduced in their brains.
The story suggests the flickering lights are an intriguing, non-invasive, and probably inexpensive idea that could hold promise for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in humans. There is a major disclaimer: “The authors caution that a ‘big if’ remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.”
This is a story that admits many of the limitations of the research it cites, but initially draws people in with a headline that promises much more than the research has so far delivered. The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The operative word, however, is “could.” This research is years away from impacting human lives, if indeed the findings end up being relevant to humans at all–and that needed to be explained better.
Furthermore, the heavy use of medical terminology and a confusing explanation of the rationale behind the study could make it hard for many people to pick up on just how far from application the findings really are. This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications.

Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.\n\nAgitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.\n\n""You\'re going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It\'s actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they\'re associated with an increase in mortality.""\n\nThe off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer\'s are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.\n\nBut Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer\'s enters its advanced stages.\n\n""We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It\'s also used for pain.""\n\nThe synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.\n\n""It\'s a milder form of TCH"" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. ""We hoped it wouldn\'t have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.""\n\nDuring the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\'s disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.\n\n""We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,"" Lanctot said.\n\nPatients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.\n\nThese benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.\n\nLanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer\'s provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.\n\n""This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It\'s not THC, and it\'s certainly not whole-plant marijuana,"" Fargo said. ""There\'s virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it\'s effective or safe in people with Alzheimer\'s disease.""\n\nA form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It\'s used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients.\n\nMarinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer\'s symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.\n\n""We wouldn\'t want to change clinical practice based on one study,"" Lanctot added.\n\nThe study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer\'s Association meeting in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe Alzheimer\'s Society has more about cannabis and Alzheimer\'s disease.']","However, the story didn’t provide any supporting numbers for the touted benefits.","This story summarizes the findings of a small Canadian study investigating whether a synthetic form of THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) helps calm agitation in people with Alzheimer’s disease. It’s unpublished work that was presented this week at the Alzheimer’s Association meeting in Chicago, and we were pleased to see the story make it clear that this means the results should be considered preliminary.
We also appreciated the overall cautious tone of this story, the clinical context of why agitation in Alzheimer’s disease is difficult to treat, and numbers that explain the frequency of the worrisome side effect of sedation.

But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.\n\nNow, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.\n\nJula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.\n\nWhen she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. ""For so long, it was: You can\'t eat this. You can\'t eat this,"" Jula says. "" I was very emotional!""\n\nShe\'s also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. ""It\'s a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet — a lot,"" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.\n\nJula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she\'s crossed a food off her allergy list, ""it makes life a little easier.""\n\nJula Cieciuch\'s story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.\n\nIn Jula\'s case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That\'s when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy.\n\n\n\nThe blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula\'s blood revealed a drop in antibody count.\n\n\n\nBut the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you\'ve been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.\n\n""What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,"" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don\'t have any reaction, ""you can take a dose that\'s a little bigger."" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they\'ve long avoided.\n\n\n\nResearchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they\'d once reacted to.\n\n\n\n""We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,"" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children\'s Hospital. ""If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.\n\nBut the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren\'t that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.\n\n\n\n""I think [the results] are very encouraging,"" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. ""We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,"" Lanser says. ""And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid\'s diet.""\n\nHe says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. ""But it\'s also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy."" As we\'ve reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.\n\nLanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That\'s because the two main tests doctors use — the blood test and the skin prick test — only reveal part of the story. ""Both tests only measure sensitization,"" he explains. ""All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.""\n\n\n\nAnd that\'s where the oral food challenge comes in. It\'s become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.\n\n\n\nSo, if you or your child tested positive for a food allergy years ago, you may want to consider seeing an allergist again.']","The story would have scored stronger if it had better described what kind of research this was, and what made it novel.","This story reports the results of a study of 6,300 oral food challenges, or medically supervised allergy tests, to determine whether patients have outgrown their food allergies.
The story did a good job discussing how oral food challenges work, and included an expert source not directly connected to the research who provided important context. It discussed the risks of oral food challenges, and why they are best done in a carefully monitored setting. The story would have scored stronger if it had better described what kind of research this was, and what made it novel. We also think a discussion of how much oral challenge tests typically cost–with and without insurance–would be useful information for parents.
One minor quibble: The headline made it sound like this was a new test–it’s not. What’s new is the research findings and what they illuminate for doctors.

Bruce Ames and Mark K. Shigenaga at Children\'s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), was shown in clinical trials to improve metabolism in overweight/obese (OW/OB) otherwise healthy adults in ways that are consistent with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consumption of the bar for two months also reduced chronic inflammation, and initiated a reduction in weight and waist circumference. Decreased inflammation and improved weight and weight distribution can lower the risk of many chronic diseases.\n\nThese effects occurred without requiring that participants make any change in their current diet or other lifestyle practices other than to eat two CHORI-bars each day for two months. The CHORI-bar is not just another nutrition bar. It is a serious intervention to improve health. Its composition is therefore complex, and required a number of years and a series of clinical trials to develop.\n\nThe publication describing this work appeared online today (April 22, 2015)1 at The FASEB Journal. The bar was developed over the past 10 years by a team of scientists led by Drs. Bruce N. Ames and Joyce C. McCann at CHORI (2,3), in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n\nMost people do not eat an optimally nutritious diet - particularly the obese. This results in unhealthy metabolism, which not only diminishes vigor, but increases future risk of many diseases. While poor diets contain much that is not healthy (e.g., too much salt, sugar), they also are missing or deficient in a number of important components (e.g., vitamins/minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber) necessary for healthy metabolism. The CHORI-bar is intended to fill these gaps with components present in the bar in normal dietary amounts.\n\nConsiderable evidence in the scientific literature, including Drs. Ames and McCann\'s work on vitamins and minerals, supports the idea that simply supplying missing or deficient dietary ingredients will improve metabolism (4-7). Development of the CHORI-bar has also been guided by Dr. Mark Shigenaga\'s insights into the importance of a healthy gut supported by optimal nutrition for disease prevention.\n\nBecause of the strong flavors associated with some vitamins and minerals, CHORI partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture to produce a tasty bar. Formulation development was guided by over 15 small clinical trials to ensure that beneficial properties of the bar were retained. Most early trials were two weeks in length and involved primarily lean individuals, most of whom benefited by increased HDL cholesterol. Results presented in this publication are compiled from 3 two-month clinical trials that also included a significant number of overweight/obese individuals. These trials were conducted over a 4-year period using very similar bar formulations. These trials employed a simple, economical design in which participants acted as their own controls (i.e., change in metabolic markers was measured before and after eating the bar).\n\nHealthy metabolism is like a complex, smooth-running machine. Unhealthy metabolism is like an old machine with many rusted out joints. There is no magic bullet ingredient in nutrition - ""oiling"" one joint is not going to allow the rusted out machine to run. The CHORI-team thinks the broad scale improvements observed with the CHORI-bar may be the result of ""oiling"" multiple joints by the complex nutrient mixture. They are currently conducting experiments to better understand which ingredients in the bar are most important in the complex mixture for the observed effects.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity is taking a huge toll on public health. Conventional approaches that encourage weight loss by improving dietary habits, reducing caloric intake and modifying activity can be successful, but prove difficult for many to initiate and sustain. The CHORI-bar is intended as a non-traditional means to positively impact the obesity epidemic by initiating a healthier metabolism without requiring sudden drastic behavioral changes. It may therefore assist in weight loss programs by beginning a process of favorable metabolic change. Improved metabolism resulting from eating the bar is also associated with a number of reports of feeling better (though this observation has not yet been formally tested), which the CHORI team predicts will help people transition to improved lifestyle habits.\n\nThe power of nutrient-rich, properly formulated food-based supplements, such as the CHORI-bar, to move dysregulated metabolism in a healthy direction may help reverse obesity-associated conditions, and thereby reduce the risk of future chronic diseases. The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.\n\n###\n\nAbout UCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland\n\nUCSF Benioff Children\'s Hospital Oakland (formerly Children\'s Hospital & Research Center Oakland) is a premier, not-for-profit medical center for children in Northern California, and is the only hospital in the East Bay 100% devoted to pediatrics.

The claims aren’t supported by evidence.,"Researchers at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI; recently renamed UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital) announce the development of a “micronutrient and fiber-dense supplement bar” that apparently led to improved metabolism and weight loss in overweight and obese individuals in clinical trials. But a supplement bar that prompts weight loss would be an extraordinary development (assuming it contains no amphetamines), and so we’d need some accordingly robust evidence to back up such claims. Unfortunately, this news release isn’t up to the task. Though it cites “broad scale health improvements” in the headline, the release offers no data that would substantiate a beneficial effect to consumers of the “CHORI bar.” It provides only vague, advertising-like claims such as this one: “The full potential of food-based supplements to do the work of some drugs without their negative side effects is just beginning to be seriously investigated.”

No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nPeople who said they didn’t exercise at the study’s start were 44% more likely to become depressed, compared to those who exercised at least 1 to 2 hours a week. For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.\n\nThe study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.\n\nIf their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.\n\nThat exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMORE: 7 Surprising Benefits of Exercise\n\n“Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”\n\nOf course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.\n\nBut when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.\n\nMORE: A New Hope For Depression\n\nThe authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.\n\n“There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.']",The story also would have benefitted from an independent source to comment on the findings.,"This Time magazine story describes a large study that looked at survey data from Norway to determine if exercise played a role in reducing the risk of developing depression among the 22,000 participants. The story suggests that it does and, to its credit, points out that this kind of study cannot show a causal relationship between exercise and the prevention of depression.
The story is filled, however, with conditional statements about what may or may not be happening in this research.  It also lacks any statements from sources independent of the study.

Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes in selected patients compared with open surgery, which can have a high rate of complications, report surgeons in The Journal of Urology®.\n\nRenal vein surgery can often be managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, but this is not typically advisable for an IVC thrombus (a fibrous clot), which is surgically far more complex with potentially fatal complications that can occur in the course of removing the thrombus and reconstructing the IVC.\n\nThe first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years.\n\nThe IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. One patient had two renal veins with two caval thrombi and one patient required a synthetic patch. Surgeries lasted from three to seven hours. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. Twenty-one patients resumed regular diets the day after surgery. Eight patients had node positive disease and seven patients had distant recurrence 15 months later including four of those with node positive disease.\n\n""This is a complex condition and the complication rate with open surgery is 12% to 47%, depending on the thrombus level, with a mortality rate of 5% to 10%,"" explained lead investigator Ronney Abaza, MD, Robotic Surgery Director at OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital. ""Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths.""\n\nDr Abaza added, ""While complications were relatively minor in our series, it is evident that complications are not entirely avoidable. Even with a minimally invasive approach, the surgical management of severe cancers in mostly elderly patients will likely involve complications. However, despite the complex and critical nature of these procedures, our series demonstrates favorable outcomes and reproducibility by surgeons with adequate robotic experience.""\n\n###']",Benefits of complex robotic procedure remain unclear when presented in a news release that only tells part of the story.,"This news release describes a study published in the The Journal of Urology whose findings suggest that “robotic nephrectomy” — robotic surgery to remove all or part of a kidney — has higher success rates than traditional open surgery when treating patients for complex clots and tumors associated with renal cell carcinoma. The study is a retrospective look at 32 individual robotic nephrectomy surgeries performed by nine surgeons, beginning with the first in 2008. The case studies involved surgeries performed on patients with inferior vena cava (IVC) tumors ranging from 1 to 11 centimeters in length. The release may have done a bit of a disservice to the quality of the research and the published results. It reads somewhat more promotional than informational and misses the mark on some of our criteria, including costs and quantification of the benefits. It offers some caution when describing the study’s limitations that could be helpful to readers, but the caution stated by the lead researcher in the journal manuscript itself was clearer and stronger.

This is why the promise of a vaccine would be extremely beneficial, says David Bulir, co-author of the study.\n\n""Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,"" said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster.\n\n""Vaccination would be the best way to way to prevent a chlamydia infection, and this study has identified important new antigens which could be used as part of a vaccine to prevent or eliminate the damaging reproductive consequences of untreated infections.""\n\nIn the research team\'s study, BD584 was able to reduce chlamydial shedding - a symptom of C. trachomatis - by 95 per cent. The antigen also decreased hydrosalpinx, another C. trachomatis symptom which involves fallopian tubes being blocked with serous fluids, by 87.5 per cent.\n\nThe results look very promising, said senior author James Mahony, a professor of Pathology and Molecular Medicine for McMaster\'s Michael G.

The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.\n\nDr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.\n\n""We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,"" explained Glass.\n\nIn previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.\n\nNext, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome ""must be interpreted with caution"" since the study wasn\'t designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nFor the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.\n\nWhat ALS does to the body\n\nWhen someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\'s disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.\n\n""I always use the analogy of a house on fire,"" said Robert Goldstein, vice president of the ALS Therapy Development Institute . His nonprofit biotech research company has 25 therapeutic projects in progress, although none of them happens to be stem cell-based. ""The body is deteriorating rapidly.""\n\nJuanita Pharr, director of care for the Georgia Chapter of the ALS Association , has both personal and professional experience with ALS: A medical social worker, she also watched her father die from the disease.\n\n""My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,"" Pharr said.\n\nNeither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr\'s father.\n\nALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr\'s father\'s case, the progress of disease was rapid.\n\n""He did not want to go on the ventilator,"" she said, adding that many people prefer a ""natural death."" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. ""There\'s no cure, and we don\'t even have a treatment,"" she said.\n\nAccording to Goldstein, this isn\'t entirely a negative. ""One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,"" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.\n\nWas this research necessary -- and ethical?\n\nThe ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.\n\n""Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,"" Glass explained.\n\nIn Pharr\'s opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant\'s perspective, since beforehand, ""patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."" Besides, she added, ""you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.""\n\nThe results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced ""incapacitating pain.""\n\n""People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,"" Goldstein said, adding, ""The selflessness of these people when they\'re told they\'re gonna die.""\n\nSadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. ""It may have had a different effect on someone else,"" she said. ""But that\'s why we don\'t have a treatment yet: because it doesn\'t work for everyone.""\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Stanley H. Appel and Dr. Carmel Armon wrote, ""These are clearly early stages of evaluating the risks and benefits of transplanting neural progenitor stem cells in patients with ALS.""\n\nThese early stages may be painful for some of the ""medical heroes"" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n""Importantly, people should understand that, at least for neurological diseases like ALS, we are just now getting started with testing our hypotheses about using stem cells as therapeutics,"" Glass said. ""We do not know if these treatments will work, and it will take time to test these therapies in a systematic and safe way.""']",This story is another example of an experimental stem cell therapy receiving news coverage while the research is still preliminary.,"A man with ALS participates in a fundraiser for research in New York City.
This story describes a small Phase 2 safety-focused trial of stem cell injections to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The trial involving 15 patients tested whether the stem cell injections, previously performed in low doses at Emory University, would be safe in progressively larger doses administered at multiple medical centers. The study was published in the journal Neurology.
There isn’t much news here; the question remains open as to whether stem cells could be a safe and effective therapy for ALS. Nothing from these studies suggest that this treatment may slow or reverse progression of ALS. Given that, the story did a good job outlining the harms and risks from the procedure, and it included quotes from independent experts. But it is another example of how stem cell therapies get news coverage, even when the research is still preliminary.

Michael Cummings, told him to keep chewing the gum as long as it helped him stay off cigarettes. So 15 years after quitting smoking, Mr. Metzger, a 63-year old retired New York telephone worker, still chews 16 pieces of nicotine gum a day.\n\nPublic health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended—perhaps even permanent—use. Anti-tobacco activists and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, the U.S.\'s leading marketer of nicotine-replacement therapy, or NRT, are also backing the potential move.\n\n""There really doesn\'t appear to be any great harm"" with long-term use of NRT, says Mr. Cummings, chair of the department of health behavior in the cancer-prevention division at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.. ""You\'re better off chewing gum or wearing a patch than smoking.""\n\nBy giving former smokers the most addictive chemical in cigarettes—nicotine—NRT is designed to ease the difficulty of quitting. In more than a quarter century on the market, nicotine gum, lozenges and patches have amassed a strong safety record. Even among most long-term NRT users, the hazards of nicotine pale beside the dangers of smoking, which is the number one cause of lung cancer and the most preventable cause of cardiac death.\n\nNicotine itself is not believed by scientists to raise the risk of developing cancer. It may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, however. It can elevate heart rate, constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Some people have adverse skin reactions to nicotine patches.\n\nLike other addictive substances, nicotine essentially hijacks the brain\'s reward system, conditioning users to associate intake with pleasure. But while other addictive drugs tend either to stimulate or relax users, nicotine can do both, depending on the user\'s mood, giving it a particularly tight grip.\n\nSudden withdrawal from the drug can induce intense cravings, nervousness, irritability, confusion and insomnia, among other symptoms.\n\nObtaining nicotine from gum, lozenge or patch doesn\'t replace entirely the pleasure of smoking any more than popping a tablet of caffeine—the addictive element in coffee—could equal the pleasure of a fresh-brewed cup of cappuccino. But jolts of nicotine can reduce the physical symptoms of withdrawal while quitters battle longings for the taste of tobacco, the sensation of smoke and various rituals that accompany the habit. (Going off NRT can also lead to withdrawal symptoms.)\n\nStudies, typically funded by NRT-manufacturers, have shown that those who use the products are about twice as likely to quit smoking after 12 weeks, compared to those who don\'t use NRT. But studies of those who successfully quit outside of NRT clinical trials often show no NRT advantage over the cold-turkey approach.\n\nAbout one in five American adults smokes—a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.\n\nNRT makers offer different dosages for heavy and light smokers, and recommend that the frequency of use decline over time, for instance, from a piece of gum every hour or two in the first six weeks of quitting to every four to eight hours in weeks 10 through 12.\n\nGlaxo products—which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches—account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT.\n\nThose skeptical of any move to eliminate warnings on long-term NRT use note that many public-health officials and anti-tobacco agencies have received funding from NRT\'s makers. ""There\'s no money to be made in cold turkey quitting, even though cold turkey is how the vast majority of former smokers kicked the habit,"" says John Polito, editor of WhyQuit, a popular blog that endorses cold-turkey cessation from tobacco.\n\nThe FDA has faced increasing pressure in recent years to loosen its rules on quit-smoking aids. Some public-health groups have filed petitions with the agency urging changes.\n\nAnother impetus is the landmark 2009 law signed by President Barack Obama that, for the first time, empowered the FDA to regulate tobacco products. The law, which is partly aimed at reducing smoking\'s toll on the nation\'s health, instructs the agency to consider rewriting the warnings on nicotine-replacement products, which range from eight to 12 weeks, depending on the type.\n\nThe warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren\'t based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials.\n\nBritain\'s Royal College of Physicians, which sets health standards in the U.K., concluded in a 2007 report on nicotine addiction that ""medicinal nicotine is a very safe drug"" and ""there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects on health.""\n\nMany other countries have less-stringent policies on NRT. Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K. have approved recommended-use periods of anywhere from six to 12 months.\n\nA few studies have examined the use of NRT beyond the current recommendations. Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania published a study in Annals of Internal Medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for 24 weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks.\n\nHowever, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nBarbara Gregg says that without nicotine gum she likely would have returned to smoking. Ms. Gregg, a 41-year-old executive assistant in the University of Minnesota\'s department of medicine, smoked for 22 years before she quit by going cold-turkey in 2007. She started chewing the gum about six months later, after experiencing nicotine cravings.\n\nIn 2009, before the start of her mother\'s funeral, she kept her father company as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot.\n\n""I can guarantee you that if I didn\'t have nicotine gum with me, I absolutely would have bummed a cigarette off my dad and picked back up again,"" she says.\n\nWrite to David Kesmodel at david.kesmodel@wsj.com and Kevin Helliker at kevin.helliker@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This is a well written story that, with just a few additions, would have been a five-star story. Biggest need: a deeper exploration of the safety record for nicotine gum. </span>","The story explained in clear terms why nicotine gum is under scruitny right now and who is pushing for its expanded use. It listed many of the side effects of using the gum and explained nicotine addiction simply and elegantly.
We wish, though, that it had presented more of the hard data from some of the studies that receive only fleeting mention, that it had provided cost information and that it had done more to discuss alternatives to nicotine gum.
On the safety record for nicotine gum all we got in this story was one health behavior specialist saying, “There really doesn’t appear to be any great harm.” And a British regulatory proclamation that “there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects.”  Statements like “doesn’t appear to be” and “no grounds to suspect” could be haunting some day. The story states that NRT products have “amassed a strong safety record” but we’re never given any details.
We also wish it had presented a more balanced perspective from the sources quoted. The two nicotine replacement users are probably not examples of how nicotine products are used widely. The use of nicotine replacement at high dose for 15 years is well outside any regulatory boundaries anywhere.

In 2012, Emily was the first child treated with an experimental immunotherapy that is on the verge of approval by the Food and Drug Administration. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)\n\nWhen doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.\n\n“We were hoping for a little improvement,” remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. “Nobody was hoping for zero cancer.”\n\nThe pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.\n\nSuch results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients’ own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.\n\nIf the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy — “a true living drug,” said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.\n\nEmily and her father, Tom Whitehead, have some ice cream alongside their dog, Lucy. Emily remains cancer-free five years after receiving CAR T-cell therapy. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)\n\nThe CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.\n\nAnd childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy’s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.\n\nThe excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission.\n\nYet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.\n\nIt involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.\n\nOnce inside the person’s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.\n\nNovartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. “CAR-T is not the EpiPen,” he said. “This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.”\n\nThe biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.\n\n“Treating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,” said Stephan Grupp of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital’s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis’s global trial. “The efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.”\n\nOne of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.\n\nTo try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.\n\nGrupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.\n\nThe young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.\n\n“I said, ‘Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,’ ” recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. “But Steve said, ‘Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.’ ”\n\nAfter she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.\n\nShe was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.\n\nThe approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.\n\nThere are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.\n\nFor the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.\n\nThe pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June’s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.\n\nFast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn’s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.\n\nBut after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl’s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.\n\nThe pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.\n\nWith FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy’s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. “Usually everything is developed first for adults,” he noted recently, “and children are an afterthought.”\n\nRead more:\n\n‘This is not the end’: Using immunotherapy and a genetic glitch to give cancer patients hope\n\nThis 8-year-old is free of cancer — for now — after a ‘breakthrough’ treatment\n\nFor a 6-year-old with cancer, a future staked on medicine’s hottest field']",But the story needed more information on the clinical trial behind the findings.,"The story focuses on a treatment called CAR T-cell therapy, which is under review by the FDA for use in treating children with leukemia who are not responding to standard treatments.
The story does a good job of describing the treatment, how it’s different from similar therapies, and how expensive it is. However, the story could have done a better job of discussing the numbers on both the remission rates and the side effects.

It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008).\n\n""By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,"" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\nIn 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease.\n\nBut it\'s not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.\n\nFor example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he\'d be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He\'s subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life.\n\nMessing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer.']",Better than ,"The story made an important attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence, explaining that “studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.” This doesn’t make up for some of the other gaps in the story  but it provides readers with invaluable information for helping them make a very important medical decision.

A week later they were shown the colours again, accompanied by a loud sound but no shocks, and their fear responses were measured.*\n\nThe fear response was 60% lower in participants who had doxycycline in the first session compared to those who had the placebo, suggesting that the fear memory was significantly suppressed by the drug. Other cognitive measures including sensory memory and attention were not affected.\n\n""When we talk about reducing fear memory, we are not talking about deleting the memory of what actually happened,"" explains lead author Professor Dominik Bach (UCL Wellcome Centre for Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and University of Zurich Division of Clinical Psychiatry Research). ""The participants may not forget that they received a shock when the screen was red, but they \'forget\' to be instinctively scared when they next see a red screen. Learning to fear threats is an important ability for any organism, helping us to avoid dangers such as predators. Over-prediction of threat, however, can cause tremendous suffering and distress in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.""\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a term for a broad range of psychological symptoms that can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. PTSD is caused by an overactive fear memory, and the new research shows that doxycycline can reduce the fear memory response in healthy volunteers.\n\n""We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for an entirely new treatment strategy for PTSD,"" explains Professor Bach. ""The theory is based on the recent discovery that our brains need proteins outside nerve cells, called matrix enzymes, to form memories. Matrix enzymes are found throughout the body, and their over-activity is involved in certain immune diseases and cancers. To treat such diseases, we already have clinically approved drugs that block these enzymes, including the antibiotic doxycycline, so we wanted to see if they could help to prevent fear memories from forming in the brain. Our results support this theory, opening up an exciting avenue of research that might help us to find treatments for PTSD.\n\n""Using drugs to prevent PTSD would be challenging, since in the real world we don\'t know when a traumatic event is about to occur. However, there is growing evidence that people\'s memories and associations can be changed after the event when they experience or imagine similar situations. This is called \'reconsolidation\', and we now plan to test the effect of doxycycline on reconsolidation of fear memories. If this is successful, we would hope to apply the technique to more clinically realistic models of PTSD within a few years.""\n\nThe work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Zurich and Wellcome.\n\n*In the first session, participants were given either doxycycline or a placebo and put in front of a computer. The screen would flash either blue or red, and one of the colours was associated with a 50% chance of receiving a painful electric shock. This happened 160 times, with the colours appearing in random order, so that participants learnt to associate the \'bad\' colour with the shock.\n\nA week later, under no medication, participants returned to repeat the experiment. This time there were no electric shocks, but a loud sound played after either colour was shown. Participants\' fear responses were measured by tracking their eye blinks, as this is an instinctive response to sudden threats. The fear memory response was calculated by subtracting the baseline startle response -- the response to the sound on the \'good\' colour - from the response to the sound when the \'bad\' colour was showing.\n\n###']",Bold claims abut this small and theoretical proof-of-concept study needed a lot more evidence.,"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes.
The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is.
The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur.

""Beta- blocker drugs compete with stress hormones and bind to the same target receptors [on a cellular level], but unlike stress hormones, do not activate cancer cells,"" said Dr. Des Powe, a senior healthcare research scientist at Queen\'s Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, in Nottingham, England.\n\nPowe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPowe and his colleagues from the U.K. and Germany evaluated 466 cancer patients: 92 had received blood pressure-lowering medications and 43 of those 92, or nearly half, were on beta blockers at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThose on beta blockers had a substantial reduction in the formation of distant cancers, or metastases, and of local recurrence. They had a 71 percent reduced risk of death from breast cancer during the study compared to those who were either taking other blood pressure drugs or weren\'t on any blood pressure medications. Those on beta blockers also had a 57 percent reduced risk of getting a secondary cancer.\n\n""Our study was performed retrospectively, using patient notes [from women] that had received treatment in the late 1980s and 1990s,"" Powe said.\n\nOther experts called the results interesting, but preliminary.

Several studies suggest a benefit to patients, but scientists say more large, rigorous studies are needed.\n\nCancer patients—due to the disease and to side effects of chemotherapy—often suffer from severe mental and physical fatigue, doctors say. Anxiety, nausea and pain are also common. In recent years, many cancer centers have been offering Reiki, a form of healing which originated in Japan in the early 1900s, according to scientific literature. In a session of Reiki, hands are placed lightly on the body. Each spot is treated for three minutes or longer and sometimes therapists place their hands just above the body without touching, says Donah Drewett, a Fairlee, Vt.-based Reiki therapist who works at Norris Cotton Cancer Center in Lebanon, N.H.\n\nExtra care is needed with cancer patients. Therapists must avoid sensitive areas on the body such as ports used to administer medications, doctors and therapists say. The gentleness of Reiki is appealing to cancer patients, many of whom are too ill to tolerate a deep-tissue massage, doctors say.\n\nReiki is often described as a treatment that helps life energy to flow in a patient—an explanation not generally accepted by scientists. Barrie Cassileth, chief of the Integrative Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, calls the energy theory ""absurd"" but says light-touch therapy can have a ""great relaxing effect"" on cancer patients ""who are constantly poked, prodded and given needles.""\n\nAdds Deborah Steele, manager of patient and family support services at Norris Cotton: ""How it works is a mystery, but we see anecdotally the amount of delight"" it brings patients.\n\nSome scientists think the benefits may be as simple as the warmth of human touch and the feeling that someone is caring for you. ""We do have a reciprocal effect between the mind and the body. if you relax one, you relax the other,"" Dr. Cassileth says.\n\nAt Memorial Sloan-Kettering, treatment for inpatients is available at no extra charge; outpatients pay $90 to $110 a session. At Norris Cotton, trained volunteers administer treatments free of charge—often while patients are at the hospital receiving intravenous chemotherapy treatments. Insurance typically doesn\'t pay for Reiki.\n\nOther centers don\'t offer Reiki, citing insufficient evidence. ""There isn\'t a good evidence base for its utility in cancer care as of yet,"" says Lorenzo Cohen, a professor in the departments of general oncology and behavioral science at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.\n\nDavid S. Rosenthal, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and medical director of the Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, co-authored a January study on Reiki that was published in Cancer. The study found twice-weekly, 50-minute sessions reduced anxiety in 18 men with prostate cancer, but the benefit wasn\'t statistically significant compared with a control group. A larger study is needed to determine if a benefit exists, Dr. Rosenthal says. ""The evidence for Reiki is still slim, but there are trends and we have to show whether those trends are real,"" he says.\n\nA 2004 study of 1,290 cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering found a light-touch massage, standard Swedish massage and foot massage all helped symptoms including pain, depression anxiety, nausea and fatigue; the study didn\'t have a control group. In a 16-person study published in 2007 in Integrative Cancer Therapies, a team of Canadian scientists found five daily Reiki sessions of about 45 minutes improved quality of life and general well-being reported by cancer patients on a 28-question survey significantly more than resting for about the same period.\n\nStudy co-author Linda E. Carlson, a psychologist and an associate professor in the oncology division at the University of Calgary, says she thinks it is possible that a good rapport between the Reiki therapist and the patients could be the reason for the positive result.\n\n—Email aches@wsj.com\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The repeated statements about “benefit…healing…treatment…positive effect” in this column seemed to outweigh the statements about lack of evidence. </span>","We give the online version of this column credit for being merely descriptive in its headline: “Reiki used for cancer patients.” Yes. This method of light massage is indeed being used for cancer patients. But there isn’t much evidence to support it. The story tries to make this point clear, but the point is muddied by some of the more exuberant language in the piece. By referring to it as “a form of healing” and talking about how parts of the body are “treated” by “therapists,” the story legitimizes what is actually an uNPRoven form of massage that at times does not even involve contact between the massage therapist and the patient.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census data, a study estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis among women 50 to 69 years of age at 3.4 million. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old woman is 44 percent. Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. As a result of its mechanism of action, it has been hypothesized that the drug abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide, would have a more pronounced anabolic (i.e., bone growing) action on bone compared with the osteoporosis drug teriparatide.\n\nPaul D. Miller, M.D., of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, Lakewood, Colo., and colleagues randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections for 18 months of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide (n = 824); or teriparatide (n = 818). The trial was conducted at 28 sites in 10 countries.\n\nAmong 2,463 women (average age, 69 years), 1,901 completed the study. New vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment groups vs placebo: in 0.58 percent (n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group; in 0.84 percent (n = 6) of participants in the teriparatide group; and in 4.22 percent (n = 30) of those in the placebo group. The estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was lower with abaloparatide vs placebo: 2.7 percent in the abaloparatide group; 3.3 percent in the teriparatide group; and 4.7 percent in the placebo group.\n\nBone mineral density (BMD) increases were greater with abaloparatide than placebo. Incidence of hypercalcemia (the presence of abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) was lower with abaloparatide (3.4 percent) vs teriparatide (6.4 percent). Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups.\n\n“Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write.\n\n(doi:10.1001/jama.2016.11136; the study is available pre-embargo to the media at the For the Media website)\n\nEditor’s Note : This study was funded by Radius Health. Please see the article for additional information, including other authors, author contributions and affiliations, financial disclosures, etc.\n\nEditorial: Osteoporosis Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With High Risk of Fracture\n\n“Ultimately, which therapy is selected for osteoporosis treatment may be less important than identifying and initiating an approved treatment,” write Anne R. Cappola, M.D., Sc.M., of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Associate Editor, JAMA, and Dolores M. Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.\n\n“The bar is high for any preventive treatment—in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies to prevent fracture and easier delivery systems but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use.”\n\n(doi:10.1001/jama.2016.11032; the editorial is available pre-embargo to the media at the For the Media website)\n\nEditor’s Note : Both authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and none were reported.\n\n# # #']",This short release on osteoporosis drug calls out many of the right caveats but could have gone further.,"There’s so much to like about this news release.

1959,story_reviews_00641,https://www.healthnewsreview.org/review/omega3-story-more-likely-to-frighten-than-inform/,2015-04-03 04:00:00,Pregnant Women: Get More Omega-3s,"[""Eating for two is exciting, but comes with a lot of baggage: weight gain, uncontrollable cravings for ice cream and pickles, and constant concern over whether your growing baby is getting all the nutrients it needs, to name a few.\n\nNow, findings published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism reveal that most women aren’t getting enough omega-3 fatty acids – healthy fats found in fish, walnuts, avocados and supplements. Specifically, they aren’t getting enough DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3-LCPUFA) that's critical to a baby's brain development. DHA is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Canada's University of Alberta studied 600 women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega 3-LCPUFAs. These include DHA, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). DHA is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association recommends that healthy adults, including pregnant and lactating women, get at least 500 milligrams per day of omega 3-LCPUFAs. Meanwhile, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg of DHA per day.\n\nThe researchers found that only 27 percent of women during pregnancy and 25 percent of women three-months postpartum were meeting those DHA recommendations.\n\nThe Power of DHA\n\n“Omega 3s are needed for the infant’s brain and nervous system to develop properly,” says contributing study author Catherine Field, a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the University of Alberta. “Also, the membranes of every cell in a person’s body contain omega-3 fatty acids. They are needed for the cell to grow and function.” After all, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, babies are doing at lot of growing.\n\nWhat’s more, during pregnancy omega-3 fatty acids are required for mom’s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby. These fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed, Field says. It’s this placenta that omega-3 fatty acids including DHA diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development, says Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, past president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as professor and director of the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.\n\nNot surprisingly, low intake of DHA in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development (often associated with crying and poor sleep) as well as lower IQs and attention deficit disorders, Field says. What’s more, her previous research in both animals and humans shows that DHA intake during breastfeeding impacts infants’ immune system development, which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of DHA through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies. She also notes that DHA supplementation may help prevent preterm labor, preeclampsia and postpartum depression.\n\nHowever, whether DHA benefits more than babies' brain health isn't conclusive. “Data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega-3 during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications. However, there are contradicting results,” Berghella says.\n\nIn fact, Berghella’s 2015 review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk. However, the review did find that women with single-child pregnancies (no multiples) had a 73 percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by 20 weeks into their pregnancies.\n\nHow to Get More DHA\n\nSushi’s one thing, but during pregnancy, you shouldn’t lay off seafood entirely, Berghella says. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish (about 8 to 12 ounces) every week. But take care to choose low-mercury options such as shrimp, salmon and catfish. The group recommends avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, and limiting white tuna consumption to 6 ounces per week.\n\nHitting those recommendations will get you approximately 1,400 mg of DHA per week, Berghella says. (While that’s not exactly 200 mg per day, if you average your intake out over the course of a 7-day week, you still hit recommended amounts.) In the University of Alberta study, seafood, fish and seaweed products contributed to 79 percent of women’s omega 3-LCPUFA intakes from food. The biggest source: salmon. Good thing, as a 2007 study published in The Lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral problems and poor scores on early developmental and IQ tests.\n\nIf you don’t eat seafood, DHA supplements can help, says Dr. Gabriele Saccone of the University of Naples Federico II’s department of neuroscience and Berghella’s collaborator. But if you do take supplements, opt for fish-oil varieties, since DHA from fish may be more beneficial than getting it from vegetarian supplements, according to Saccone. And no worries, they are low in mercury.\n\nEven if you are eating some seafood – just not quite two servings per week – a fish-oil supplement could still help. In the current study, women who took a supplement were 11 times more likely to get 200 mg of DHA per week during pregnancy and lactation compared to those who went supplement-free. Apart from taking supplements, Field also recommends eating foods enriched with DHA, such as milk and eggs.\n\nWondering about avocados, walnuts and olive oil? While they are all filled with omega-3 fatty acids, they aren’t of the DHA variety. These plant sources of omega-3s contain ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which, while good for you, has a hard time converting into DHA so that it can really benefit baby’s brain development, Berghella says. In North Americans and Europeans, only about 4 percent of all ALA consumed becomes EPA or DHA, Field says.""]",This story embraces a study’s finding that “women aren’t getting enough” omega-3s during pregnancy. We thought the story could have provided more context with that message.,"This story had some useful information. It does a nice job explaining what omega-3 fatty acids are and how they are related to development in babies. It also gives an overview of general recommendations for omega-3 intake and fish consumption during pregnancy. But we were hoping for more critical interpretation of the new study which is the news hook for the story. And while it does mention a study that critically examines some claims about omega-3s in pregnancy, the story also drops a litany of scary-sounding conditions — lower IQs, attention deficit disorders, asthma and allergies, preterm labor, preeclampsia, postpartum depression, stillbirth, early infant death! — that are supposedly linked to insufficient omega-3 intake. We think the cumulative effect of this barrage is more likely to frighten than inform.

She now has eight locations in New York, Florida and Israel. The Brooklyn salon, opened in April, has big boxes of lollipops and Twizzlers. Cartoons playing on a TV screen are interrupted by the constant ring of the phone and chatter of schoolchildren. A lice check at a local private school one day last week had brought a steady stream of business.\n\nSome six million to 12 million infestations of head lice occur each year in the U.S. in children ages 3 to 11 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite experts’ assurances that head lice pose no health concern, the insects are a regular source of angst for schools and families, who may spend as much as hundreds of dollars to get rid of them.\n\nAn enlarged view of Pediculus humanus--a human head louse. Photo: Getty Images\n\nLice have become increasingly resistant to widely used over-the-counter shampoos such as Nix or Rid, which contain permethrin or pyrethrins. While such products are still recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups as the first line of treatment, some doctors and parents are turning to new topical treatments, which are generally available by prescription. Also getting a boost are combing salons, some of which have expanded into multistate chains.\n\n“The process of combing out is the only way to get rid of all the lice and nits,” says Deborah Capone, who calls in Lice Busters’ employees when there is a lice outbreak at the three preschools she runs in Brooklyn.\n\nThe salons typically use a technique known as wet combing. Hair is doused in some sort of lubricant—often Pantene conditioner—and employees use a specially designed comb to remove the lice and nits. The conditioner loosens the pests and makes them easier to spot. The process can take more than an hour as hair is combed multiple times from different angles.\n\nLice Busters’ Ms. Harel says her two New York locations charge $20 for an initial check and $150 to $250 for a treatment, depending on hair length and how severe the infestation is. A recheck a week later is another $20. Employees also do house calls.\n\nCustomers at the Brooklyn salon say they come there to avoid applying chemicals on their children’s heads. “We can leave here relieved,” says one mom.\n\nKarin Kutasewich, owner of Lice Squad in Toronto, Ontario, works to remove lice from a customer’s hair. Adding conditioner makes the hair easier to comb through. Photo: Melissa Renwick/Getty Images\n\nThere are close to 1,000 lice-removal companies in the U.S. today, says Katie Shepherd, founder and chief executive of the Shepherd Institute for Lice Solutions, a nonprofit in West Palm Beach, Fla., that trains people who want to start a lice-combing business. By comparison, there were 42 such companies in 2009 when she published a book that detailed her method of nit removal. Ms. Shepherd also heads a company that tests lice products and she operates three lice-combing salons.\n\nSome experts criticize lice-combing businesses because they aren’t regulated. People who work in the salons tend to have no particular training in pest control or entomology, says Richard J. Pollack, a senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University. And most aren’t able to distinguish between debris and dandruff, and between a nit, a louse and some other kind of bug, says Dr. Pollack, who also runs a consulting business called IdentifyUS LLC that identifies bug specimens, mainly bed bugs and ticks, and offers guidance on managing pest problems.\n\nNewer prescription treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, and to have no serious side effects, according to an article published online in the journal Pediatric Dermatology last week that reviewed studies of the products. The effectiveness of traditional over-the-counter shampoos has dropped to about 25% from nearly 100% two decades ago, the researchers say. “Widespread and indiscriminate use” of the traditional products and mutations in lice made them resistant to the insecticides, they say.\n\nThe prescription products include benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia; ivermectin, or Sklice; malathion, or Ovide lotion; and spinosad, sold as Natroba. The medications have been found to be from 68% to 87% effective after one or two applications. Most don’t require combing.\n\nThe review article’s authors, some of whom have consulted with pharmaceutical companies, also say there is no evidence for the effectiveness of some popular home remedies for lice, including dousing the hair in olive oil, petroleum jelly, mayonnaise or essential oils, practices that could also be unsafe.\n\n“We thought it was time to review some of these newer products so people would understand what control options they have,” says John Clark, a professor of environmental toxicology and chemistry at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a co-author on the study.\n\nHaving multiple treatment options is important to help prevent the rapid development of resistance again, says Dr. Clark, whose research has documented the development of the mutations in lice believed to have contributed to their resistance to over-the-counter treatments. Dr. Clark says he has worked as a consultant for some of the companies that developed the prescription treatments, but has no current active research projects.\n\n“My guidance would be that the first step should be to contact a physician and ask for a visit and prescription,” says William Ryan, another co-author on the Pediatric Dermatology article. Dr. Ryan says he previously ran the development program for the company that created Sklice. He works as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry but isn’t currenlty working for any companies with lice products.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and some other medical associations, including the National Association of School Nurses, still recommend OTC shampoos as the first line of treatment for lice unless resistance has been documented in a community.\n\nThe OTC treatments sometimes don’t seem to work because the lice diagnosis wasn’t accurate or the products aren’t used properly or the patient became reinfected, says Dawn Nolt, clinical associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Ore.\n\nWhile the prescription drugs are effective, they are more expensive, says Dr. Nolt, who is on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that developed last year’s updated lice recommendations. Prescription lice medications can cost as much as $300 and aren’t always covered by insurance.\n\nNatasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City, Mo., recommends parents first try the over-the-counter lice treatments because they are inexpensive and will still work in certain regions of the country. If those aren’t effective after one or two days, she suggests a prescription medication or occasionally oral antibiotics in combination with an OTC treatment.\n\n“Some parents don’t like to do the prescriptions because they think it’s more chemicals on their kid’s skin,” Dr. Burgert says. As for a combing salon, “It’s a nice option and it certainly gets the job done. It’s just very, very tedious.”\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com']",We were pleased to see how the story pointed out any potential conflicts of interest among the sources.,"The treatment of childhood cases of head lice infestations is a popular news media perennial at the start of the school year, and this Wall Street Journal story falls into that category.  It covers the usual elements — prevalence of the infestations among school age children, over-the-counter and prescription treatments, home remedies (which generally don’t work) and reassurance about the pesky but essentially benign health impact.

But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks — as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.\n\nThere are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.\n\nFor women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women’s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.\n\nEvery day, about 6,000 women in the United States — more than two million women a year — enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.\n\nFor months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.\n\nThe most common symptom — hot flashes — can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy — H.R.T. — to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.\n\nThen in 2002, the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement, the Women’s Health Initiative (W.H.I.), created a kind of menopausal panic, prompting millions of middle-age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them.\n\nThe study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)\n\nThe hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed — on the surface — to outweigh the benefits.\n\nHowever, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., “The W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,” and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. “The pendulum has swung too far,” she said.\n\nThe W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.\n\nIn the years after the W.H.I. findings, many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement, especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer.\n\nExperts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.\n\nDr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made “a big mistake” by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. “The cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,” he said.\n\nIn a Danish randomized controlled trial of 1,006 women entering menopause, among those given hormones for 10 years, “there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer — a clear benefit with nominal risk,” Dr. Hodis said. These benefits persisted after 16 years of follow-up, according to the study, which was published in 2012.\n\nDr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don’t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.\n\nIn an analysis in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. Philip M. Sarrel and his co-authors calculated that, based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the W.H.I. study, avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18,601 to 91,610 women in the decade after the study’s release.\n\nDr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women — about a third of those now on hormone replacement — who are relying on “custom-compounded” products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.\n\n“There’s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,” she said. “Women today have so many options — a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.” In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.\n\nTo help women and their doctors assess H.R.T. options and select the best treatment for women 45 and older with menopausal symptoms, the North American Menopause Society has developed a mobile app, MenoPro, for iPhone/iPad and Android devices.\n\nRelated:\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.']","When clinical research is mentioned in this blog post, no specifics are given on the measured benefits or harms.","In this New York Times’ Well blog post, the gist of the text is supporting the idea that old fears about the health risks of hormone replacement therapy for women have been rethought and new conclusions should reassure the public about its safe use–especially in short-term (fewer than 5 years) relief of menopausal systems.
The post mentions that HRT has been used in two ways: to treat menopause symptoms, and to prevent chronic disease. But the information is relayed in a somewhat confusing, incomplete way. For example, there was no discussion of where the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force falls on the idea of using HRT to prevent chronic disease. (They recommend against it.) When clinical research is mentioned, no specifics are given on the measured benefits or harms.

But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.\n\nA spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.\n\n""Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,"" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.\n\nThe millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.\n\nKaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.\n\nIn the United States there\'s no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.\n\nThe new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.\n\nKnown as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.\n\nSER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, ""and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.""\n\nHe is scheduled to present his team\'s research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray\'s manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDesmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.\n\nTo assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.\n\nFor three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).\n\nPatients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.\n\nDesmopressin spray prompted ""a significant decrease"" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.\n\nThe treatment group also experienced a ""significant increase"" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.\n\nThe researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a ""significant improvement"" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.\n\nThough SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.\n\nDr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as ""promising,"" but added a note of caution.\n\n""Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,"" he said. ""However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.""\n\nGriebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.\n\nBut the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) ""may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,"" he said. ""Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.""\n\nThe study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.\n\nDr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.\n\nPeople who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.\n\nThese findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThere\'s more on nocturia at the National Association for Continence.']","This story carefully pointed out the known harms of the intervention, but could have been more specific on costs and alternatives.","This story is about a proposed new drug for nocturia, which is defined as having to urinate two or more times during a normal night of sleep. The story also briefly mentions another study linking increased physical activity with a smaller number of people suffering from nocturia.
The story included commentary from an independent source and discussed potential harms of the drug, which is good. And we’re told early on that the information about the study will be used a a presentation at a conference, making it preliminary. We also appreciated that the study’s funder was disclosed.
But the story didn’t mention potential pricing for this new drug, and it didn’t compare the drug against currently available treatments for this condition.

Called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the lung ailment has forced 54-year-old Calick to use steroids and a rescue inhaler daily.\n\n“You can’t get up and walk 10 or 15 feet to go to the bathroom without wheezing,” Calick, of West Hempstead, New York, told FoxNews.com.\n\nCalick’s medications helped manage COPD, but anytime she stopped taking them, her symptoms would return.\n\nAs Calick ran out of options, she sought help from Dr. David Borenstein in New York City. Borenstein, an integrative medicine physician, is one of numerous doctors in the world who is using stem cell therapy to treat various diseases.\n\nStem cells, which can self-renew and replace damaged areas of the body, have been used in the treatment of orthopedic, cardio, autoimmune, neurological— and pulmonary disorders, like Calick’s.\n\nFor the procedure, Borenstein draws fat cells from the patient’s buttocks or midsection during liposuction, and then separates the stem cells in a centrifuge. Next, stem cells are mixed in a solution, which is administered through an IV and put into a nebulizer, from which the patient inhales them.\n\n""The ideal candidate for this procedure is someone with an early-stage [form of] COPD, so we can halt the progression of the disease,” Borenstein told FoxNews.com.\n\nBorenstein said about two-thirds of his patients see COPD relief within several weeks to about five months, and that those results last for about a year.\n\nAlthough Borenstein’s stem cell treatments for COPD isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or covered by health insurance, Calick said the procedure— which costs less than $8,000— was well worth the price.\n\n""I could walk further, I\'m not wheezing , I could go out with different friends, stand for long periods of time, walk places,” Calick said of her condition after the stem cell therapy. “[If] someone says, ‘Oh, you\'re using the elevator,’ [I say], ‘No, I’m using the stairs!”\n\nFor more information on stem cell therapy for COPD treatment, visit David Borenstein’s website.']",Vague language and anecdotal claims amount to advertising for an unproven treatment.,"We were thrilled to see this story mention the costs of the treatment, its lack of FDA approval, and the fact that insurance won’t cover it. But that was just one sentence. The rest of the story is so heavily focused on the experiences of one patient who believes she was successfully treated through stem cells that readers would understandably be driven to dial up this doctor based on scant evidence, no real understanding of the potential benefits, no independent assessment of the treatment, no comparison to alternatives, and no mention of risks.

But the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn’t known, researchers said.\n\nThe study, conducted in the Netherlands, involved 1,747 men and women from a larger study of aging. The subjects were 71 years old, on average. About three-quarters had partners. Researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory, mental processing speed, general cognitive function and fluid intelligence, or the ability to reason and think abstractly.\n\nSubjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally, and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging. Chronic diseases, depression and medications were recorded.\n\nA quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important, while 41% rated it as unimportant. Nearly 28% agreed that sexuality at an older age isn’t important anymore; 42% felt it was important.\n\nCurrent sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32% and 6%, respectively, but 67% believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people, while 12% didn’t agree.\n\nSubjects who didn’t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy, and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant, had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity. The association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes, but seemed stronger in women, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The study didn't include subjects with severe cognitive impairment. Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn’t be determined.\n\nThe Perception of Sexuality in Older Adults and Its Relationship with Cognitive Functioning\n\nRunning injuries: Regular shoe changes—and playing different sports—may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners, suggests a study in the current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.\n\nRunning involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations, which can lead to overuse injuries, researchers said. Alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load, the study suggests.\n\nIn 2012, researchers in Luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners, 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s, for the 22-week study. More than half, 56%, alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models, on average, while 44% mostly wore the same pair.\n\nThe subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities, including the type of activity, duration, intensity, distance and shoe use. Pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded, along with the day the sport was resumed.\n\nA third of participants reported at least one running-related injury during the study. Most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36% lasted up to a month or longer.\n\nRunners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39% lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions, the adjusted results showed. Multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58% of the time during the study period, while other runners wore the same shoes 91% of the time.\n\nRunners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week, about twice the amount of time spent by single-shoe runners, and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions.\n\nCaveat: The study was relatively short, which may have limited the number of reported injuries, researchers said.\n\nCan parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?\n\nResponse shift: People treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves, playing down the severity of their worst outbreak, a study found. This change in perception, called a response shift, could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease, according to a report in the March issue of Contact Dermatitis.\n\nA response shift is particularly important in clinical studies, as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects, the study said. Taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients, researchers suggest.\n\nEczema affects an estimated 10.2% of U.S. adults, according to the National Eczema Association, a nonprofit research organization. Hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients’ quality of life, the study said.\n\nResearchers in Denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema, 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70. Quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart. Subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extremely bad) at both time points.\n\nClose to two-thirds, 61.2%, rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment, at 3.5, on average, compared with 4.7 on the first assessment, indicating an improvement, researchers said. Eczema was unchanged or worse in 38.8%. But 49.1% of subjects rated their worst-ever eczema outbreak at 8, on average, at the second assessment and 8.5 on the first, a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The six-month follow-up period was relatively short, researchers said.\n\nResponse shift in severity assessment of hand eczema with visual analogue scales""]",The provocative headline for this story might have things backwards.,"This story was about an observational study suggesting a link between sexual activity/fulfillment and better cognitive function in older people. A story that did more than scratch the surface of this study would have uncovered an obvious limitation: Older people sometimes aren’t healthy enough to have good (or any) sex, and seniors who aren’t healthy enough for sex probably also have brains that are less healthy than their sexually fulfilled peers. So suggesting that sex “leads to a sharper mind” is an oversimplification of what’s going on here.
We appreciate the story’s closing caveat that “Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn’t be determined.” But such a statement can’t make up for the cause-and-effect language of the headline.

But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.\n\nRadiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.\n\nIn studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.\n\nThe study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.\n\nThe findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.\n\nIf used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors ""personalize"" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.\n\n""The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,"" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.\n\nEncouraged by their findings, the study\'s authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.\n\nTwo prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.\n\nDr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.\n\nBoth methods have their limits and, ""while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,"" Schwartz said. ""It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.""\n\nDr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, ""this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.""\n\nHe believes that the new tool\'s ""greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence ""personalized"" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.""\n\nHowever, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and ""further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.""\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on prostate cancer.']",Why is it so important to report on mouse research that a news organization is compelled to write the mouse story before a talk is even presented at a scientific conference?,"The story conveyed a cheerleading tone throughout, starting with the the story’s opening words – “A noninvasive scan…”  Non-invasive is usually an attribute of scanning technologies.

If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.\n\nRight now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson\'s disease and tremor, for which it\'s approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano\'s work, dementia.\n\nIn 2008, Lozano\'s group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher\'s surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.\n\nUsing a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano\'s group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain\'s memory circuitry. As Alzheimer\'s progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.\n\nThat our memories — so entwined with our personalities and senses of self — might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There\'s something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.\n\nYet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer\'s affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.\n\nThe study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. ""The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,"" explains Lozano. ""It\'s easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function."" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.\n\nNext, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn\'t turned on for a year, though they didn\'t know it.\n\nPreliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.\n\nGiven that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.\n\nIn terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer\'s disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer\'s tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano\'s final results won\'t be reported until four years out.\n\nMore intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains\' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer\'s typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano\'s study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain\'s memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.\n\nReversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer\'s research, and Lozano\'s finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.\n\nLozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents — requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he\'s encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. ""We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,"" he says, a finding that could mean there\'s a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer\'s.\n\nEvidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved – meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.\n\nA group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer\'s. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano\'s study no serious side effects were seen.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.\n\nReferring to Lozano\'s second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, ""The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer\'s disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.""\n\nHowever he acknowledges Lozano\'s results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.\n\n""The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,"" he says. ""But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.""\n\nIn a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show\'s main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim – and inspired by Lozano\'s initial paper — House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor\'s memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.\n\nDBS for treatment of Alzheimer\'s and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won\'t be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. ""Even though House did this, we\'re not doing it yet,"" cautions Lozano.\n\nYet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.\n\n""We\'re hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,"" says Lozano. ""We want to turn these brain networks back on.""\n\nBret Stetka is a writer based in New York and an editorial director at Medscape. His work has appeared in Wired, Scientific American and on The Atlantic.com. He graduated from University of Virginia School of Medicine in 2005.

The study involved a procedure in which an implanted neurostimulator delivered electrical signals to the fornix area of the brain to help regulate abnormal signals in patients with potential mild Alzheimer’s. A similar procedure is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor.
The story provided some compelling details, but could have used a jolt of skepticism as it examined the challenge of applying a treatment that works for some diseases to an altogether different medical condition. Like the release, the story didn’t describe serious adverse effects of the treatment. The story also didn’t include costs and conflicts of interest.

Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background.\n\nGretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months.\n\nTelephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided.\n\nThe clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms.\n\nAt four month’s follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms. At four months’ follow-up there also was greater decline in self-reported GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms among participants in the telephone CBT, according to the results.\n\n“Telephone-delivered psychotherapy is one way to overcome some barriers to mental health treatment that rural older adults face,” the study concludes.\n\n(JAMA Psychiatry.

It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,” said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. “We found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.”\n\nThe researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.\n\n“Although we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,” said Dr. Lim. “Postpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.”\n\nLabor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note. Additional research is needed to identify which women are more likely to experience severe labor pain and who would benefit the most from effective labor pain-control strategies to help reduce the risk and affect of pain on postpartum recovery.\n\nTHE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTSFounded in 1905, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) is an educational, research and scientific society with more than 52,000 members organized to raise and maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology. ASA is committed to ensuring physician anesthesiologists evaluate and supervise the medical care of patients before, during and after surgery to provide the highest quality and safest care every patient deserves.\n\nFor more information on the field of anesthesiology, visit the American Society of Anesthesiologists online at asahq.org.

It instead relies heavily on association which does not prove causation.","A news release from the American Society of Anesthesiologists highlights the results of a preliminary study on the effect epidurals might have on post-partum depression.
According to the release, “some” of 201 women who choose epidural pain relief during the birth of their child saw a decreased risk of developing postpartum depression, or PPD. Specifically, those who scored lower on a pain improvement scale showed a lower likelihood of developing PPD. The release notes two risk factors were accounted for in detecting this association — depression and tissue trauma caused by birth — and indirectly hedges on how something else may be responsible for the perceived effect
However, that’s where the utility of this release ends and its problems begin. How many women saw a benefit? What about the strength of the effect? Were all of the biggest confounding factors accounted for, like social support and economic status? Why weren’t women who chose natural births not used as controls? And is natural birth really so risky and traumatic, as this release implies?
Those are just a few of the important questions that this release (and even the not-yet peer-reviewed study it’s based on) fail to answer or simply address. The tone of the news release and the abstract (both by the American Society of Anesthesiologists) suggests that epidural anesthesia is helpful in preventing postpartum depression, but that assertion remains far from proven. A number of health journalists have picked up this news release and some provided important background details and caveats not found in the American Society of Anesthesiologists release. This article in Cosmopolitan magazine — despite an unfortunate subheadline touting “amazing superpowers” — is a good example. It acknowledges other research suggesting that “…it’s not just the degree of pain, but the amount of support a woman receives during childbirth that can influence whether she’s traumatized by the whole experience and develops depressive symptoms because of it.”

And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years.\n\nThat\'s why it\'s a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK\'d a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem.\n\nNot a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year – out of more than half-a-million born that way.\n\n""Although that may seem like a small percent, it\'s really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,"" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots.\n\nAccording to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth.\n\nThe drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection.\n\nAnd even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn\'t a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo.\n\nInterestingly, the drug is not new — it\'s just taken a long and circuitous route to approval.\n\nIn 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 ""for reasons unrelated to safety,"" as the FDA puts it.\n\nIn fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them.\n\nThe FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it\'s requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy.\n\nEveryone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems.\n\nFleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there\'s no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it\'s not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed.\n\n""We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,"" Fleischman says, ""and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.""']","Cost was the only one of our 10 criteria not addressed by this solid, tight reporting on a new drug approval.","Given that 50% of care is covered by Medicaid and 49% by private payors, the costs for this drug are invisible to the individual. It is administered in clinic or by home health nurses and does not typically have a co-pay structure although patients will sometimes tell providers they can’t afford it.

The results so far are very promising.\n\n""Our data have shown that a concentrated formulation of adalimumab injected directly into the diseased tissue may be effective in targeting the cells responsible for Dupuytren\'s disease,"" said Jagdeep Nanchahal, MD, PhD, University of Oxford Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who led the study.\n\n""This brings new hope to people who suffer from this disabling condition, who currently have to wait for their situation to be deteriorate, watching their hand lose function until it is bad enough for surgery. And then there\'s the lengthy recovery ahead, a less than ideal situation to find yourself in.""\n\nThis randomised trial (phase 2a) recruited 28 patients with Dupuytren\'s disease who were scheduled to have surgery in Edinburgh to remove diseased tissue in their hand. Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.\n\nThe findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.\n\nDupuytren\'s disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.\n\nThe anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\'s disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.\n\n""We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren\'s disease,"" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute. In conjunction with Professor Sir Ravinder Maini, Sir Marc identified TNF as a therapeutic target in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n""The Kennedy Institute has a long history of successfully translating laboratory findings to the clinic\'"" said Professor Fiona Powrie, Director of the Institute. ""This type of work requires close collaboration between laboratory scientists, clinical trialists and clinician scientists over many years"".\n\nThe researchers are continuing to investigate the use of this drug to treat Dupuytren\'s disease in a phase 2b trial called the RIDD trial, which is currently running in Oxford and Edinburgh.\n\n###\n\nThe research was funded by the Health Innovation Challenge Fund which is a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust and the Department of Health. Funding for the drug was provided by 180 Therapeutics. The trial was run by the UKCRC accredited Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU), Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford.']",Changes in surrogate markers don’t necessarily translate to better health outcomes affecting patient pain and quality of life.,"The headline of this news release promises “new hope” for patients with Depuytren’s disease: a disabling hand condition characterized by progressive contracting of the fingers into a clawlike deformity. The cause is unknown, the course of the disease is often gradually progressive, and there’s no curative treatment.
The study highlighted in the release only shows chemical changes over two weeks in 28 subjects. It can’t show (or promise) clinical improvements in patients’ hand deformities.
The key question for patients is: “will this therapy decrease the frequency or severity of the disabling finger contractures?” The news release doesn’t make it clear enough that the study looked at the level of genetic markers associated with myofibroblasts and that these markers (called “surrogate markers“) may not even affect how the disease progresses clinically.
The news release also falls short in discussing costs, potential harms, alternative nonsurgical treatments, and significant financial conflicts of interest among most of the study authors.
For the lead authors — who stand to benefit from patents related to this therapy — to dangle “new hope” at this very preliminary stage of laboratory research is premature and arguably irresponsible.

Data found that the most common side effects are either eliminated or greatly reduced using image guided treatment. The study which was conducted at the Prostata Center of Offenbach, Germany (www.prostate-center.org) will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).\n\n""The patients we have treated at The Prostata Center have had their cancers destroyed without the need for surgery, with a low incidence of side effects and in most cases have been back on their feet the next day,"" said Dr. Michael K. Stehling, an internationally recognized expert on image guided tumor ablation treatments and primary author of the study. ""The data from this study confirms what we see every day, we have a very attractive approach for patients who are concerned about quality of life challenges and are considering options for the treatment of localized and late stage prostate cancer,"" he said.\n\nDr. Stehling has treated the most prostate cancer patients in the world using this image guided treatment, while generating the best therapeutic results. At the Prostata-Center which he founded in 2010, Stehling has treated hundreds of patients at every grade and stage of prostate cancer, and helped to advance the use of image guided treatment technologies. Dr. Stehling is a German Professor of Radiology, a former Associate Professor at Boston University and served as Research Assistant to Sir Peter Mansfield, Prof of Physics and Nobel Prize winner in Medicine in 2003 (for discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging).\n\nUnlike other treatment procedures for prostate cancer therapy, image guided or irreversible electroporation (IRE) only destroys cells; vital tissue structures are not affected, making IRE the first tissue-selective form of therapy. IRE uses strong electric fields that cause cells to die without exposing the tissue to radiation or heat. IRE is precision guided and reliably destroys cells within the treatment field, but important anatomical structures in and around the prostate such as nerves, the intestinal wall, the sphincter, veins and arteries are spared. Potential issues with erection and bladder control and other side effects are reduced while healing time is minimal, making it an ideal method for focal prostate cancer therapy and for men concerned about quality of life challenges.\n\nFor the study, Dr. Stehling and his team of researchers evaluated data from 265 patients with primary (stages T1-T4) and recurrent PCa after surgery, radiation therapy and HIFU. Initial tumor control was achieved in all patients, and during the follow-up period of up to 4 years, the recurrence rates were 0/55 (Gleason <7), 3/117 (Gleason 7) and 10/67 (Gleason >7). There were no IRE-related complications and toxicity was extremely low: 27 patients reported a transient reduction of erectile function (EF) (resolved after 6-8m), 15 a permanent reduction and 2 a permanent loss of EF.\n\nThroughout the study, there were no cases of IRE-related incontinence, even when the lower urinary sphincter was included in the treatment field. Incontinence is one of the most common adverse side effects of current treatments for localized prostate cancer and can have a substantial impact on the quality of life. The IRE treatment also had very low toxicity on the rectum and bladder, even in cases of advanced cancer infiltrating these structures in patients who were not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy anymore.\n\n""Treating prostate cancer with minimal pain and minimal risk of impotence and incontinence, even in patients with advanced and recurrent cancer, with a one-time, one-day treatment, until recently, was unthinkable,"" Dr. Stehling said. ""The cutting edge technology of IRE makes this a reality.""\n\nCo-Authors of the study include: E Guenther, DIPLPHYS; N Klein, MSc; S Zapf; D Kim, MD; B Rubinsky, PhD\n\nSOURCE The Prostata Center\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.prostate-center.org\n\n']",The headline vaguely touts this therapy as an “image guided” treatment alternative to surgery. What’s news about this research is that it involves neither surgery nor radiation but “irreversible electroporation” (IRE).,"There is much interest in the treatment world about the area of irreversible electroporation (IRE), which is a new way to damage cancer cells inside solid tumors, including prostate cancer tumors, by using an electric current. IRE, marketed as the NanoKnife, is a “new minimally invasive surgical technique that selectively kills tumor cells by using electrical fields to make holes in cell membranes,” according to Stony Brook School of Medicine which has begun using the method to treat certain types of pancreatic cancer. As exciting as the topic may be, this news release drops the ball on several levels. The Germany-based study claims to show that results from 265 patients showed fewer side effects with an image-guided IRE therapy for their prostate cancer than they would have had with other methods. But the claim is never backed up. Cost, valid evidence, alternatives and context are all missing from the release — hence the 1-star score.
Note: We’ve previously reviewed a different news release about the NanoKnife and covered the fascinating dispute that ensued between University of Louisville employees over the source of that news.

Although Anselmo\'s surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn\'t tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.\n\ntoggle caption WNYC\n\nThe chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.\n\nThe year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she\'d lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.\n\nAfter all that, Anselmo and her husband weren\'t ready to give up on her cancer fight. He\'d read about advances in targeted therapies — drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.\n\nThe family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo\'s tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.\n\nHer oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.\n\nKnowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. ""It\'s like you\'re in a parking lot,"" Hyman says. ""And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it\'s the third car on the right. What we\'re doing now is we\'re saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we\'re only going straight to that car.""\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kendall Messick Courtesy of Kendall Messick\n\nToday, Anselmo is doing well. She\'s been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.\n\nThere are side effects, of course. She\'s lost some peripheral vision, though she\'s been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it\'s free to Anselmo because she\'s taking it as part of a study.\n\nNow she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She\'s back in training with her longtime vocal coach.\n\nAs this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.\n\n""We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we\'ve given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she\'s been much better,"" Hyman, her oncologist, says.\n\nStill, he cautions that the targeted treatments can\'t be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo\'s cancer at bay could stop working. ""Every patient is different in how long it works,"" he says. ""We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don\'t know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.""\n\nThere\'s no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn\'t have had otherwise.\n\nAfter all the misfortunes she\'s been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn\'t see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, ""I\'m the luckiest.""\n\nOur series is produced with member station WNYC, and with Ken Burns Presents: Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies, which will air on PBS starting March 30.

It does a nice job with this limited material, but taking a broader look at the evidence would’ve yielded a stronger, more useful story.","The article briefly recounts the story of MaryAnn Anselmo and her experience with genetic targeting to treat her glioblastoma. NPR’s story is a nice primer on genetic targeting for cancer treatment, and how it can, in some patients, prove more effective and tolerable than standard cancer treatments. By zeroing in on one mutation in one person, the reader gains an understanding of genetic targeting’s promise. However, by not mentioning other types of targetable mutations, or the associated costs, or the larger base of evidence that is relevant to this approach, the piece could give readers an overly simplistic and incomplete understanding of genetic targeting. There are, in fact, more than 300 genetic variations in solid tumors (e.g. brain cancer) known to have some response to targeted treatments–BRAF is only one of them–and the costs can vary astronomically, depending on the drug used. Some acknowledgment of that context, and the studies that have already investigated genetic targeting, would have strengthened the story considerably.

But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.\n\nWhat\'s most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.\n\n""This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,"" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. ""But it could be game-changing.""\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.\n\nHowever, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.\n\nAbout half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only ""modest,"" Rowe said.\n\nThen there\'s the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a ""minimal-function"" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.\n\nBoth new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers\' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.\n\nRowe\'s team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.\n\nRowe\'s team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.\n\nAfter four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a ""pronounced improvement.""\n\nThe other trial had nearly identical results.\n\nThis is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has ""pushed the needle"" for patients with one F508del mutation.\n\nAn editorial published with the studies said they ""represent a major breakthrough.""\n\nNow the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.\n\n""The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,"" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. ""This is very exciting news for our community.""\n\nRowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?\n\nPatients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.\n\nSo far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were ""mild to moderate,"" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.\n\nIf the experimental drugs are ultimately approved, there will be the real-world issue of price.\n\nVertex currently markets the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as Symdeko -- at a reported list price of $292,000 a year.\n\nIn the United States, more than 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis, according to the foundation.\n\nMore information\n\nFor an overview of cystic fibrosis, visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.']","Thankfully, the story did mention the extremely steep cost of these drugs.","This story reports on two trials that showed adding adding one of two new drugs to standard therapy possibly improved short-term lung function in cystic fibrosis patients who fall into two common categories of gene mutations.
The story wisely included the high cost of some of these compounds, known as CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulators. However, the story did not give enough data to help readers make sense of the scope of the benefits. And while it did contain some caveats about the quality of evidence, those cautions were drowned out by numerous optimistic–and speculative–statements about how the drug will perform in future trials.

This test might help.\n\n""Those molecules will circulate in the blood for some time, they can be measured, and you can see the contributions from essentially every tissue in the body,"" senior investigator Stephen Quake told BuzzFeed News. ""When you are pregnant you can see the contribution from the placenta and the fetus,"" said Quake, a professor of bioengineering and applied physics at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\nBoth tests use cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are snippets of genetic material released by cells when genes are active. They float around in the mother\'s bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.\n\nHowever, a new blood test — which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab — can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it\'s not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.\n\nPregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.\n\nThe scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.\n\nThey identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.\n\nAll the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.\n\nIn a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.\n\nIn a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that\'s within two weeks of a baby\'s actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.\n\n""It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,"" he said.\n\nThere\'s a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.\n\n""Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it’s a huge problem,"" Quake said. If doctors know someone is at risk for premature labor earlier in pregnancy, they might start efforts to help delay labor, such as recommending bed rest.\n\nQuake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature. She\'s now a healthy 16-year-old. ""You realize, holy cow, that was a pretty risky thing that we had no control over and no sense that it was coming,"" he said.\n\n""We’d like to see a bunch of lives saved, that’s really the goal here,"" Quake said. ""There’s a lot of work left to do before we get to that point, but we are pretty energized and excited at this point.""\n\nThe study was funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, although Quake and his colleagues have filed for a patent on the test.']","The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and — more importantly — the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant.","This BuzzFeed News story reports on early-stage research into an experimental blood test that aims to predict whether or not a pregnancy is at risk for premature birth. To determine that risk, the test looks for specific pieces of RNA generated by the baby that migrate into a mother’s bloodstream and which are associated with preterm deliveries. The story offers a short, readable, un-hyped, and eminently useful summary of the research, and it offers several comparisons to the standard alternative, which is an ultrasound scan. The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and — more importantly — the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant.

The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.""\n\nAbout Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) and Overdose\n\nOpioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]\n\nLife-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]\n\nNaloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]\n\nAbout EVZIO (EVV-zee-oh)\n\nEVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. EVZIO is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance. EVZIO is small, easy-to-carry and easy-to-use to help patients and caregivers keep it on hand so they can take fast, confident action administering EVZIO during an opioid emergency. Results averaged across two adequate and well-controlled usability studies demonstrate more than 94% of users can correctly administer EVZIO without training, and 100% with training.[12] Each EVZIO pre-filled, single-use, hand-held Auto-injector delivers a single 0.4 mg dose of naloxone. Each EVZIO prescription comes with two Auto-injectors and a Trainer.

Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in postoperative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation.\n\nAbrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.\n\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The findings have been published in Scientific Reports.\n\nThis is the first time tandospirone has be shown to reverse the deficit in brain neurogenesis induced by heavy alcohol consumption\n\nTandospirone acts selectively on a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A)\n\nThe researchers also showed in mice that the drug was effective in stopping anxiety-like behaviours associated with alcohol withdrawal, and this was accompanied by a significant decrease in binge-like alcohol intake\n\n""This is a novel discovery that tandospirone can reverse the deficit in neurogenesis caused by alcohol,"" said study leader neuroscientist Professor Selena Bartlett from QUT\'s Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation.\n\n""We know that with heavy drinking you are inhibiting your ability to grow new neurons, brain cells. Alcohol is specifically very damaging for neurons.\n\n""Other studies in mice have shown that tandospirone improves brain neurogenesis, but this is the first time it has been shown that it can totally reverse the neurogenic deficits induced by alcohol.\n\n""This opens the way to look at if neurogenesis is associated with other substance-abuse deficits, such as in memory and learning, and whether this compound can reverse these.""\n\nProfessor Bartlett, who is based at the Translational Research Institute, said the discovery by study co-authors QUT postdoctoral research fellows Dr Arnauld Belmer and Dr Omkar Patkar came about serendipitously after research started in a different direction.\n\n""It was surprising, and exciting,"" Dr Belmer said.\n\n""This drug is relatively new and available only in China and Japan.

The release states in the second paragraph that this is a mouse study but then several times it suggests that the findings will be applicable in humans. Only human clinical trials can show if this is the case. The release doesn’t quantify any improvements, define any potential harms from the drug, name who funded the work or offer any insights into conflicts of interest. While it mentions the drug is now available in China and Japan, it offers no information on its probable cost if approved for sale in the West.
The release headline doesn’t mention that this study took place in rodents. As a result, some news story headlines are echoing that this drug has been found to reverse brain effects of alcohol, never making it clear that the results apply only to rodents.

""We went through all of the relevant human epidemiological data on this topic and narrowed it down to 16 high-quality observational studies of over 12,000 women from all over the world,"" Cortessis says.']",Yet it didn’t give enough details on how cervical cancer rates compared among groups.,"This is a story reporting results of a systematic review of studies about the relationship of IUDs to cervical cancer. After combing through multiple studies, the researchers identified 16 high-quality studies. Evidence in those studies indicated women with IUDs are 30% less likely to get cervical cancer, the story said.
But we wanted to know: 30% less than what? What is the incident rate in women with IUDs — and women without them? To its credit, the story points out that these were observational studies, meaning they weren’t actual clinical trials, and more evidence is needed before women should make the decision to get an IUD just as a way of preventing cervical cancer.

In a hip replacement, an artificial joint comprising a ball and socket is implanted to replace the natural ball and socket in the pelvis, enabling movement that is typical of the hip joint. While dislocations only occur in about 1 percent of patients after hip replacement, certain individuals may be at a higher risk.\n\nNYU Langone research presented at last year\'s AAOS Annual Meeting showed that spinal deformity was a significant risk factor for dislocation and subsequent revision surgery. The researchers reported at the time how the lumbar spine, or lower back, moves during posture changes like transitioning from sitting to standing, creating alterations in so-called spinopelvic relationship,"" which changes position of the hip socket and may cause an implant to dislocate in a person with spinal deformity.\n\nThis led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation, and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk.\n\n""Dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail, and when it happens, sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem,"" explains lead study author Jonathan Vigdorchik, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU School of Medicine and associate fellowship director of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital. ""Orthopedic surgeons need to be more aware of this problem and think about the risk of dislocation prior to performing a hip replacement instead of just dealing with the complications after the surgery. We need to be proactive in our approach.""\n\nWhat the Study Found\n\nSome newer hip implants are designed with dual mobility cups that allow for increased range of motion, which helps reduce dislocation risk. However, no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants, which are often more expensive than conventional implants, may not be medically necessary, and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily.\n\nFor the study, researchers reviewed data on 1,082 total hip replacements performed using computer navigation between January 2014 and December 2015, during which period no dual-mobility implants were used. The overall implant dislocation rate among this cohort was found to be 1.8 percent. Of this group, 320 patients had spinal disease and deformity as evidenced by imaging scans, and of them, 10 experienced dislocations, suggesting a dislocation rate of 3.1 percent for high-risk patients, or about three times higher than normal.\n\nBeginning in 2016, surgeons used the standardized risk prediction model and treatment algorithm developed at NYU Langone, which factored in data collected from preoperative imaging taken while the patient was sitting and standing, and other measures that might affect risk for dislocation, including presence of a previous lumbar fusion. Using the risk assessment tool, the researchers identified 192 of 1,009 patients as high risk for a dislocation after surgery. All 192 patients underwent a total hip replacement through the high-risk algorithm, with dual mobility implants being used in 143 of the cases. The researchers reported only one dislocation in this high-risk group (or 0.5 percent of high-risk patients), compared with 3.1 percent in the previous group not assessed with the risk assessment and treatment algorithm. These findings represent a six-fold decrease in the rate of dislocation in the high-risk group.\n\n""There were significantly fewer dislocations in the high-risk group once all of our patients were analyzed through our new treatment algorithm,"" explains study co-author Aaron J. Buckland, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery in the Division of Spine Surgery and director of spine research at NYU Langone. ""We were able to stop these implant dislocations from occurring in the first place, sparing our patients follow-up care and the need for revision surgery.""\n\nAll patients who undergo hip replacement at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery. Other technologies including laser-guidance, computer navigation, and robotic surgical devices are used for the especially high-risk and complex cases identified through the algorithm in order to ensure the best possible outcome free of complications.\n\n###\n\nThis research presented at the conference has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and is currently in submission. Future studies aim to examine how the algorithm affects long-term outcomes and clinical benefits in patients at high risk for dislocation.\n\nThis poster, ""A New Risk-Assessment Score and Treatment Algorithm for Patients at High Risk of Dislocation following Total Hip Arthroplasty,"" was selected by the AAOS Central Program Committee as the Best Poster in the Adult Reconstruction Hip classification at the 2018 AAOS Annual Meeting.

Compared with those who did not undergo the protocol, these patients had lower rates of hip dislocation after their surgery, which would presumably reduce the need for revision surgeries to replace a failed implant. How did the protocol help? The release suggests that pre-operative imaging scans helped identify and guide the treatment of patients with spinal problems who needed so-called dual mobility implants. These implants allow a greater range of motion and are credited with decreasing the risk of a hip dislocation.
Here’s what we liked about the release: It features a relatively thorough description of how the study was conducted, quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, and gives good insight on why such a presurgical assessment might be helpful to direct patient care. Our main concern is this:  The release suggests that the new protocol deserves all the credit for the better outcomes, when in reality it’s not clear whether other factors played a role. Information about costs and the potential harms of dual mobility implants would also have been helpful for readers.

These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.\n\nStatins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called “bad” or LDL cholesterol — a risk factor for heart disease — and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSeparate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body’s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday’s study.\n\n“Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,” said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.\n\n“Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.”\n\nDouglas’s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors’ practices in Britain to identify statin users.\n\nThey then matched each statin user — who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 — with up to five non-statin users for comparison.\n\nPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\n\nDouglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">This was a problematic story.  Much of the content and some quotes appear to be taken directly from a news release.</span>","And here’s why that’s important: There was no discussion of costs or harms, insufficient information about limitations, and no independent perspectives.

The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients\' lives.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.\n\nAccording to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.\n\n""We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn\'t know if the patients actually felt better,"" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. ""I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don\'t realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.""\n\nRadiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn\'t require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients\' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients\' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.\n\n""Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,"" explained Dr. Chao. ""With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.""\n\nThe team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.\n\n###\n\nNotes for editors\n\nThe article is ""Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,"" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

The study is the first large, multi-institutional study of SBRT in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up.\n\nAlthough prostate tumors generally respond well to radiation therapy (RT), the possibility of radiation exposure to healthy tissue in the genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems can be of concern. SBRT is an advanced technique that precisely targets high doses of RT to the tumor in a small number fractions, simultaneously avoiding surrounding tissue and reducing toxicity to non-cancerous cells. The technique has become the standard of care for many non-surgical lung cancer patients, as it limits exposure to the heart and surrounding lungs. When treating tumors in the prostate, SBRT avoids the adjacent bladder, sex organs and rectum.\n\n“Single-institution studies on the use of SBRT as the primary treatment for prostate cancer have illuminated the treatment as a cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT,” said Robert Meier, MD, lead author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. “Our study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.”\n\nA total of 309 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled in the trial at 21 community, regional and academic hospitals across the U.S. Eligible patients had either low-risk disease (CS T1-T2a, Gleason 6, PSA < 10) (n = 172) or intermediate-risk disease (CS T1c-T2b with either Gleason 7 and PSA < 10, or Gleason 6 and PSA 10-20). All of the men received SBRT via a non-isocentric robotic platform, with an RT dose to the prostate of 40 Gy administered in five treatment sessions of 8 Gy each. Intermediate risk patients received a dose of 36.25 Gy to the seminal vesicles. Concurrent and adjuvant androgen ablation therapy were prohibited among study participants.\n\nPrimary outcomes included GU and GI toxicities and relapse-free survival (RFS). Researchers measured toxicity using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Biochemical failure was assessed using the ASTRO-consensus and the nadir+2 definitions. Overall survival (OS) was measured as a secondary outcome for the study. Actuarial OS and RFS were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier statistical method. Median follow-up was 61 months.\n\nAt five years following SBRT, 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression. In low-risk patients, the cancer control rates was superior to historical controls. Specifically in the low-risk group, the five-year RFS rate was 97.3 percent, which is superior to the 93 percent historical comparison DFS control rate (p = 0.014). Actuarial five-year OS was 95.6 percent for the entire cohort. Actuarial five-year nadir+2 RFS was 97.1 percent for all patients, representing 97.3 percent of low-risk and 97.1 of intermediate-risk patients. Actuarial five-year ASTRO RFS was 92.3 percent and 91.3 percent for low- and intermediate-risk groups, respectively.\n\nFewer than two percent of all patients experienced serious side effects in the five years following SBRT. Five grade three GU side effects were reported in four of the 309 study participants. There were no reported grade four or five toxicities nor any grade three GI toxicities. Between half and two-thirds of patients experienced less serious side effects, with rates of 53 and 59 percent for grade one GU and GI toxicities and rates of 35 and 10 percent for grade two GU and GI toxicities, respectively. These side effects were usually temporary.\n\n“Our results illustrate how advanced technology has radically improved our ability to target cancer,” said Dr. Meier. “After following patients for more than five years, we found that serious side effects from a brief course of SBRT were uncommon and that cancer control rates were very favorable compared to historical data. Our trial confirms that SBRT may be preferable to other treatment approaches for newly-diagnosed cases of prostate cancer, including more aggressive disease.”\n\nThe abstract, “Five-Year Outcomes from a Multi-Center Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer,” will be presented in detail during a scientific session at ASTRO’s 58th Annual Meeting at 7:45 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, September 26, 2016.

Maugh II\n\n3:15 PM PST, January 12, 2011\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision on whether to give young children antibiotics to treat ear infections has been swinging from one extreme to the other as conflicting clinical trials have pushed pediatricians first toward widespread use of antibiotics, then toward a “watch and wait” approach in which most infections seem to clear up on their own.\n\n\n\nTwo new trials reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine are nudging the pendulum back toward treatment of the infections, known formally as acute otitis media, especially for the youngest children. They show that the use of antibiotics in infants under age 2 is only modestly effective and reduces the duration of symptoms by only a small amount, but it prevents relapses and progression of the disease.\n\n\n\nThe trials “are indicative of a benefit to treatment of acute otitis media in children, specifically when the diagnosis is certain,” said Dr. Wilbert Mason, an infectious diseases specialist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. The reduction of symptoms was marginal, he said, “but they were less likely to have a relapse or to have persistent signs of infection at the end of therapy.”\n\n\n\nThe findings “confirms the current guidelines” for treating children under age 2, said Dr. Al Lieberthal of USC’s Keck School of Medicine, who is in charge of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee that prepared the guidelines. The guidelines will be revised in light of the new studies, however, to tighten the definition of acute otitis media, he added.\n\n\n\nThere have been at least a dozen previous clinical trials studying the use of antibiotics in ear infections, known formally as acute otitis media. These have given mixed results, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, because of poor study design and especially because of poor diagnosis of the subjects’ conditions.\n\n\n\n“In many cases, [the children] had something that looked like otitis media but really wasn’t,” he said. The new studies “had really precise criteria to be eligible for enrollment,” which makes them “substantial studies.”\n\n\n\nIn one of the studies, Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and his colleagues studied 291 children age 6 months to 23 months with stringently defined acute otitis media. Half were given the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days and half a placebo.\n\n\n\nIn the second study, Dr. Paula A. Tahtinen of Turku University Hospital in Finland and her colleagues studied 319 children age 6 months to 35 months, half of whom were given the antibiotic and half a placebo for seven days.\n\n\n\nIn the Pittsburgh study, 80% of the children receiving an antibiotic had a resolution of symptoms by day seven, compared with 74% of those receiving a placebo. But 67% of those receiving an antibiotic had a sustained resolution of symptoms, compared with 53% of those who got the placebo.\n\n\n\nThe Finnish study looked for continuing symptoms, which is known as treatment failure. It found that, at the end of seven days, treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of those who received antibiotic, compared with 44.9% of those who received a placebo.\n\n\n\nThat sounds like a big improvement, said Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, chair of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who also helped prepare the AAP’s guidelines, “but all it means is that if the eardrum looked nasty, the treatment failed.

That includes those who are under 6 months of age; those who have a draining ear caused by a ruptured eardrum; those with severe symptoms early on; and those with infections in both ears.\n\n\n\nBut physicians are reluctant to give antibiotics indiscriminately because of the side effects, which include diarrhea, yeast infections, oral thrush, allergic reactions and resistant bacteria. “You pay a price for a little bit of improvement,” Rosenfeld said.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">Overall, a credible job in telling the story of the latest chapter of the long saga of debate over treatment options for common childhood ear infections. </span>","Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine show slight decrease in recurrence of ear infections in children under 2 if antibiotics are given.

The story could have explored the shared decision-making encounter that parents could have with pediatricians based on this new evidence.  By comparison, CNN’s story did a much better job helping parents with this angle.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.\n\nMany foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower ""good"" HDL cholesterol levels.\n\nIn the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.\n\nThey recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.\n\nThe daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.\n\nThe researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn\'t gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.\n\nRegistered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn\'t surprised that the women didn\'t gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.\n\n""Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,"" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.""\n\n""The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It\'s kind of like nature\'s toothbrush, and it\'s brushing the bad stuff out,"" she explained.\n\n""Another good thing in apples is pectin. It\'s a substance that\'s used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what\'s going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,"" she said.\n\nShapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.\n\nBut Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.\n\n""Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,"" she said. ""Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.""\n\nShapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAlso, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about the importance of fruits and vegetables from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.']","<span style=""font-size: small;"">The story relies on a news release (a statement from a researcher) and an abstract of a talk not yet given at a scientific meeting.  That’s an incomplete basis for a widely distributed health news story. </span>","Granted, it sought an independent nutritionist’s perspective but she was reacting to the same incomplete information from an abstract of a talk not yet given.
It also reports cholesterol-lowering results only in relative risk reduction terms, giving readers no good sense of the scope of the potential benefit.

The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.\n\nThe cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.\n\n""It almost completely knocked out the patients\' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,"" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThis FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.\n\nA rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg\'s oncology department.\n\nHe knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton\'s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.\n\n""Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,"" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. ""We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It\'s an interesting repurposing of that drug.""\n\nWhile the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.\n\n""Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you\'ve ingested that you\'re allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,"" Bochner said. ""I don\'t know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we\'re excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.""\n\nCurrently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they\'re allergic to.\n\n""The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,"" Bochner said. ""Maybe they\'ll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they\'ll be able to eat a full meal\'s worth of peanuts. We want to know if this would safely change their actual ability to eat foods that they currently need to avoid.""\n\n###\n\nThe study was funded by a 2016 Dixon Translational Research Grant.']","The release should have been more clear that this study has significant limitations in both sample size and duration of effect and that nothing is known about whether this effect can be repeated usefully, reliably or safely.","What we have here is a tentative demonstration of a new concept in allergy treatment, reported in a brief letter to the editor of a medical journal, which is puffed up to look like proof of effectiveness. Meanwhile, looming challenges of both safety and cost are soft-pedaled or ignored. There is legitimate news that an anti-allergy effect of a cancer drug (ibrutinib), previously observed in lab and animal experiments, has now been seen in two patients. But the release buries the limitations of the study and ignores serious safety and cost challenges, while highlighting speculative musings about food allergy treatments that were not part of this study. Most readers of this release would likely be surprised to learn that ibrutinib has potentially life-threatening side effects and that the dosage studied costs more than $100/day.
